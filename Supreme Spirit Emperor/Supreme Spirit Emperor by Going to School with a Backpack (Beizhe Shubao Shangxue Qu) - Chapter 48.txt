Hearing Leng Qiuchan's words, the three black-cloaked men behind her bore expressions of disbelief as they cast a glance at her, evidently perceiving that she had become an entirely different person at this moment.

How alluring the temptation of the Locking Spirit Pagoda was! Though their sect was no ordinary one, even they possessed few earth-level treasures. Not even Leng Qiuchan, of her esteemed status, owned an earth-level weapon; she could only obtain one upon reaching the Bone-Consuming Stage to serve as her defense.

Yet here lay an earth-level weapon before them, with a high probability of falling into Leng Qiuchan's grasp. But their mistress had forsaken it, gifting it to Luo Tian with vacant eyes.

"Miss, this is the Locking Spirit Pagoda!" one of the black-cloaked men murmured in entreaty, attempting to dissuade Leng Qiuchan.

"Don't speak further—your mistress's decisions are immutable!" Leng Qiuchan barked, silencing the three from continuing.

...

At the ninth level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda, resounding thunder echoed ceaselessly. Three figures clashed in a maelstrom of combat—Chen Changsheng, Tu Yuuzheng, and Pang Haoran locked in relentless battle.

At this stage, all three closed their eyes, as if merging with the very space around them—practicing the secret technique of Shuiyuan Sect, "Unity of Man and Heaven."

Discarding their staffs, they fought barehanded, their lips bleeding profusely yet appearing oblivious, their bodies enveloped in verdant energy that continuously mended their nearly shattered forms.

Before them stood an object, towering three zhang high, shaped like a tablet, radiating overwhelming aura.

"Crash..." The deafening roar returned, and the three figures abruptly separated before surging toward the center once more.

Though their bodies had been replenished by wood-elemental spiritual energy, its restoration could not match the rate of their exhaustion. Cracks formed across their flesh, signaling they had reached their limit.

The final strike—each of them poured their entire strength into it, determined to decide the victor in this clash.

Three figures surged like three torrents of water, merging and clashing for dominance.

For a moment, the scene became entangled again; if this continued, their fates would be dire—only mutual annihilation awaited.

At that moment, a jade-like antler, crystalline and luminous, burst forth from Chen Changsheng's storage ring. It transformed into a torrent of wood-elemental spiritual energy, instantly restoring Chen Changsheng's nearly shattered body.

With this fresh reinforcement, Chen Changsheng seemed divinely aided, swiftly overpowering the other two.

Three breaths passed in an instant; Chen Changsheng, now a torrent of verdant energy, consumed the other two within those three breaths.

"Crash... Crash..." Two figures were hurled backward, collapsing onto the ground. Their eyes, previously closed, snapped open in clarity—though their gazes bore deep bitterness.

Chen Changsheng stood motionless, then opened his eyes, a flicker of confusion crossing his face before recalling the emerald glow. His expression softened with gratitude—this was the antler from the guardian beast he had once taken in the Deer Clan. He never expected it would aid him so crucially at this moment.

"Senior Brothers, I have the honor!" Chen Changsheng smiled lightly and ceased further attention to the two who had lost.

Hearing Chen Changsheng's words, Tu Yuuzheng and Pang Haoran exchanged glances. Their physical states were dire, and they knew the inheritance and treasures within had no connection to them.

They trembled as they rose, swallowing pills into their mouths before staggering toward the exit.

Chen Changsheng observed their retreating figures and wore a faint smile—after so many years, subduing them brought him exhilaration.

He gazed at the black iron "Heaven-Shaking Mirror" radiating immense pressure, then smiled again. "If I refine it, this journey should be complete," he murmured, gently caressing the black iron mirror before closing his eyes and beginning to refine it, just as Luo Tian had done.

The moment the two—Tu Yuuzheng and Pang Haoran—emerged from the light barrier, their hearts brimmed with resentment. Yet there was nothing they could do; to lose was to accept fate.

Chai Xiangming, Jing Boran, and Feng Tianxiong watched Tu Yuuzheng and Pang Haoran's gloomy exit, their faces lighting with joy. Clearly, this meant Chen Changsheng had triumphed. The thought of the treasures within the cave chamber filled them with elation.

"We should go," Pang Haoran, unwilling to witness Chai Xiangming's smug face, snorted and addressed Gu Zhengye and Zhuang Shengjie: "Let's go downstairs."

Tu Yuuzheng, unable to locate Leng Qiuchan and her companions, snorted and strode downward.

Chapter 232: Exposure

Chapter 232: Exposure

As Chai Xiangming observed everyone departing, the three of them remained idle. He smiled at the others: "Let's take a stroll; there's no one left, so we needn't linger here."

Hearing Chai Xiangming's words, Feng Tianxiong and Jing Boran nodded. This journey had concluded perfectly; Chen Changsheng had refined the Heaven-Shaking Mirror, and they could now depart. There was no point in remaining outside.

The three strode downward, aware that unless Chen Changsheng wished it, no one would gain another chance to enter this earth-level weapon.

...

At that moment, Luo Tian had refined the fifth level, commanding the ancient tortoise of the fifth tier. Yet he knew this tortoise possessed no combat ability—its defense was merely extraordinary. Any opponent could outpace it, rendering its protection futile. As for the fourth-tier golden-element automaton he had commanded to hide in the void, it was already attacking those who dared strike him.

Leng Qiuchan and her companions stood before Luo Tian, each second stretching endlessly. Leng Qiuchan's heart churned with anxiety; she did not know when these people would descend. If they arrived, could her four withstand the assault of over ten individuals before an earth-level weapon? After all, no one could resist its temptation!

As she mused, heavy footsteps echoed into her ears, causing her heart to leap. "So fast!" she murmured in alarm.

Leng Qiuchan's mind reeled, her face darkening as she beheld Tu Yuuzheng and Pang Haoran descending the stairs.

Tu Yuuzheng and Pang Haoran bore expressions of confusion, their feet barely touching the second level before sensing its anomaly.

Seeing Luo Tian with his eyes closed, they widened their gazes—Tuo Boye's corpse lay beside him, unchanged.

"Hah! Even without the Heaven-Shaking Mirror, obtaining this Locking Spirit Pagoda is no small feat!" Tu Yuuzheng laughed, brandishing his staff and attacking Luo Tian. He believed Leng Qiuchan was waiting for him, unable to stop him.

"Curse!" Pang Haoran's face darkened upon seeing Tuo Boye's corpse, growling and attacking Luo Tian as well.

"Go away..." A cold voice echoed, a chilling long sword intercepting Pang Haoran's form.

"You!" Pang Haoran had not expected Leng Qiuchan to block him, his face etched with disbelief.

Seeing Leng Qiuchan intercept Pang Haoran, Tu Yuuzheng's heart leaped with joy. He thought she was blocking Pang Haoran for him, allowing him to severely wound Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian's state clearly could not divert his attention—this was the perfect opportunity to ambush him.

Yet a familiar cold aura emerged within his perception; Tu Yuuzheng realized it must be the automaton from the fourth level he had previously overcome.

His eyes flashed with coldness, and he let out a snort: "If I could subdue you once, I can do so again—what difficulty is there?"

The staff radiated thick waves; Tu Yuuzheng strode forward to confront the golden-element automaton.

As for the remaining Zhuang Shengjie and others, Tu Yuuzheng had no concern—Leng Qiuchan's three black-cloaked companions were already attacking the remaining three.

Suddenly, chaos erupted at the second level as those who had passed eight levels unleashed their infighting, turning on one another.

The moment Chai Xiangming and his companions heard the waves, they exchanged strange glances. Yet when their eyes fell upon Tuo Boye's corpse, their faces turned pale with alarm.

Tuo Boye's sect was renowned in the Southern Region; his death in the Northern Region would surely provoke retaliation from his clan. When they saw Luo Tian seated on a chair, they grasped the truth—yet they had not expected Luo Tian to dare kill Tuo Boye so openly.

Observing the ten battling wildly, their faces grew solemn. At this point, they naturally understood why Luo Tian sat there—his eyes bore inner conflict.

The temptation of an earth-level treasure was immeasurable; Chai Xiangming and his companions knew that if they could severely wound Luo Tian, they might still have a chance against the remaining people. Yet recalling Luo Tian's past kindness toward them, their faces bore intense inner conflict.

"Kill!" Chai Xiangming drew his sword and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Seeing Chai Xiangming attack Luo Tian, Jing Boran's hesitation vanished; his eyes flashed with madness as he brandished a long sword and charged toward Luo Tian.

Seeing their movements, Feng Tianxiong snorted, producing a golden jade mace in his hand. He rushed toward Luo Tian—but not to attack him, but to strike Jing Boran and Chai Xiangming.

Perceiving their arrival, Leng Qiuchan fought against Pang Haoran while observing Luo Tian. Upon seeing Chai Xiangming attack Luo Tian, she barked: "Return!"

With the step of the Sealing Heaven, she instantly appeared before Chai Xiangming, striking with a jade fist and drawing him into her battle with Pang Haoran—evidently intending to fight two at once.

Jing Boran was intercepted by Feng Tianxiong, his face displaying surprise: "Feng Tianxiong, what do you mean by this?"

Among the three, Feng Tianxiong had always been silent and rarely conversed with others. Now, seeing him block Jing Boran, he asked:

"Have you forgotten that he once did you a favor in the previous levels?" Feng Tianxiong coldly snorted, standing before Luo Tian and demanding.

"What favor could outweigh the Locking Spirit Pagoda!" Jing Boran's face bore madness.

An earth-level weapon—this was a prize sought after by even those of the Soul-Consuming Stage, and some who had reached the Ritual-Soul Stage would also vie for it. If he could control this Locking Spirit Pagoda, even if Luo Tian was extraordinary, he would be unable to withstand him.

Though his chances of seizing the Locking Spirit Pagoda were slim, given others also eyed it greedily, he would not hesitate to gamble on even a one-in-a-million chance. Success meant ascension; failure merely invited censure—what was that compared to the Locking Spirit Pagoda?

"There's nothing more to say. Fight!" Feng Tianxiong's eyes flashed with coldness, clearly incited by Jing Boran and Chai Xiangming's actions. He brandished the jade mace, attacking them furiously.

Chapter 233: His Life Is Mine

Chapter 233: His Life Is Mine

At the second level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda, chaos continued. All present were prodigies of their time; for now, no clear victor emerged—except one unexpected event.

Tu Yuuzheng shattered a fire-elemental spiritual energy-formed flame with a punch, his face alight with joy. Previously, after defeating the fourth-level golden-element automaton, a fire-elemental spirit had appeared to block his path. After an exchange, he finally shattered the flame.

"Hah!" Tu Yuuzheng laughed as his figure darted, his staff radiating thick water-elemental spiritual energy and striking Luo Tian fiercely.

His eyes brimmed with endless satisfaction, recalling how this current situation was due to Luo Tian's interference. Without him, Chen Changsheng and others would have already been eliminated—there would be no chance for Chen Changsheng to reach the final level. Thus, he had a high probability of obtaining the Heaven-Shaking Mirror!

As his staff approached Luo Tian, this strike carried Tu Yuuzheng's boundless anger and frustration. This was his full-force attack, capable of wounding even the Bone-Consuming Stage. Even if Luo Tian was extraordinary, without warning, he would not survive—though he might be severely injured.

Leng Qiuchan, seeing this, felt anxious and desperately blocked Pang Haoran while initiating the third step of the Sealing Heaven. Her body transformed into a streak of light, intercepting Tu Yuuzheng's path.

In an instant, a glint of cold light pierced the void, striking Tu Yuuzheng's staff and repelling it. Leng Qiuchan stood before Luo Tian, her body radiating a chilling aura.

"You!" Tu Yuuzheng's face bore disbelief—how could his hired aid block him at the last moment? His expression darkened.

"His life! It is mine!" Leng Qiuchan spat blood, her black veil soaked.

Due to the hasty interception and having fought Pang Haoran and Chai Xiangming alone, Leng Qiuchan had suffered immense exhaustion. Under Tu Yuuzheng's full-force attack, she sustained a severe wound.

"You forget—this was my hired aid! Now you assist others?" Tu Yuuzheng asked, his face dark.

"I choose who to aid—your kind is not worthy!" Leng Qiuchan stood with her sword, her face resolute.

"Then I must subdue you first!" Tu Yuuzheng's eyes flashed with madness, his fury at Leng Qiuchan's betrayal reaching its peak. His staff lifted again, pressing toward Leng Qiuchan.

Pang Haoran and Chai Xiangming joined the battle, their faces also displaying madness. They did not care about defeating a woman and attacked Leng Qiuchan fiercely.

"Miss!" The three black-cloaked men bore fierce killing intent, their faces anxious as they watched Leng Qiuchan entangled with three opponents. Though she was extraordinary, Tu Yuuzheng and Pang Haoran had sustained injuries in the ninth level. With Chai Xiangming's addition, three prodigies against one woman—should they fail to subdue her, their faces would be ruined.

The thunderous sound of clashing echoed between the four figures as Leng Qiuchan appeared, each time spitting blood. Her already pale face grew even paler, her lifeless complexion and trembling body evident.

"Don't resist! Though I three dare not kill you, if this continues, I'll have no choice but to act harshly!" Tu Yuuzheng's voice was cold as he watched Leng Qiuchan gasping.

"His life! It is mine—no one may touch it!" Leng Qiuchan's body radiated a cold darkness, her dark-elemental spiritual energy seemingly boundless. Her eyes bore fierce determination.

Her slender fingers extended, her sword sweeping—blood appeared before her, landing in her hand. This was one of Leng Qiuchan's rare reserves of essence blood.

"Burning essence blood! What is this Luo Tian to you, that you fight so desperately!" Tu Yuuzheng roared, his face stunned.

Burning essence blood was a method known to all cultivators—consuming one's own essence blood for a temporary surge in power, usually employed when desperate.

Leng Qiuchan's hands moved swiftly, her fingers tracing the air as if drawing something. Her face grew paler with each motion; after every stroke, her fingers were marked by a line of blood. Simultaneously, her power surged incrementally.

A crimson, strange seal materialized before Leng Qiuchan, slowly approaching her slender form.

If combined with this seal, her power would reach a terrifying level—though the cost was the irreplaceable essence blood.

"Return!" A cold voice echoed, causing the red seal to halt abruptly.

"Return... return!" The cold voice echoed again; a powerful spiritual awareness caused the red seal to revert into crimson essence blood, flowing back toward her fingertips.

A male figure stood before Leng Qiuchan, his face filled with anger as he took her jade hand.

"Luo Tian!" Tu Yuuzheng and the others bore fear, gazing at the thin young man.

Others also ceased their movements; the three black-cloaked men instantly appeared before Leng Qiuchan, their faces filled with intense concern.

Chai Xiangming and Jing Boran bore bitter expressions, their eyes avoiding Luo Tian's.

Luo Tian seemed to ignore their gazes, his hand holding a white cloth as he carefully bandaged Leng Qiuchan's wounded finger. He snorted: "My life! You need not save it!"

Leng Qiuchan, hearing Luo Tian's words, bore a faint smile. Her cold voice replied: "A favor."

"Hmph!" Luo Tian snorted, gazing at them with a cold demeanor—especially when his eyes fell upon Chai Xiangming and Jing Boran, his gaze flashed with ferocity.

That glance made the two shiver as if plunging into a thousand-year cold潭, their bodies trembling involuntarily. Their eyes fell upon Tuo Boye's corpse, fear deepening within them.

Chai Xiangming spoke: "Luo... Luo Tian!"

"Don't speak further—I understand. After all, people die for wealth." Luo Tian smiled, gazing at them.

"Hmph! Ungrateful scum!" Feng Tianxiong, who had always been silent, bore a hint of mockery as he gazed at Jing Boran.

Jing Boran's face bore a flicker of shame, his teeth gritting as he spoke: "Luo Tian, I Jing Boran have wronged you. Strike or kill as you wish!"

Chapter 234: Three Doses of Essence Blood

Chapter 234: Three Doses of Essence Blood

At the second level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda, a heavy atmosphere surrounded the place. Ten people stood with solemn faces—caused by the thin young man standing before Leng Qiuchan. It was as if they awaited his judgment.

"Ha, rest assured—I won't hold it against you. After all, no one can resist the temptation of the Locking Spirit Pagoda," Luo Tian said calmly to the others.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, no one felt relief; they could sense his seemingly calm gaze concealed a furious rage.

"However! I Luo Tian have always despised when my friends are harmed because of me. Thus, you must pay the price!" Luo Tian's gaze turned icy, his voice like a cold wind slicing through their hearts.

"What do you intend to do?" Chai Xiangming's face bore a hint of fear.

"Nothing much—my friend nearly lost her essence blood because of you. I've always returned kindness with kindness; thus, you must offer three doses of your essence blood. Otherwise, I'll act myself. Believe me, in this Locking Spirit Pagoda, you won't escape."

After speaking, Luo Tian's face bore a cold cruelty. As his words ended, the door to the first level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda slammed shut with a thunderous roar, as if a giant hammer had struck their hearts.

At the moment the door closed, Ying Hongtu's figure appeared beside it, his face shocked. He had just burned a dose of essence blood to reach his maximum speed, attempting to escape the Locking Spirit Pagoda—yet Luo Tian had discovered him and intercepted.

"Everyone, you don't think I've been sitting on this chair for so long doing nothing, do you? Indeed, the Locking Spirit Pagoda has now been refined by me."

Luo Tian extended a finger, tracing an unusual symbol in the air. A thunderous sound echoed; five figures appeared before them—those three to seven-level guardian automatons.

The five figures landed on the ground, swiftly surrounding them. The automatons' bodies emitted various colors of light into the air, converging to form a five-colored barrier that enclosed Luo Tian and them.

"Luo Tian, don't be too bold! I don't believe you dare imprison us forever!" Tu Yuuzheng roared, his face wild. His confidence stemmed from knowing that he and Pang Haoran were safe—his sect's elders would not let them die.

"Silence!" Luo Tian vanished from his spot, appearing before Tu Yuuzheng. His furious fist struck like a hammer toward Tu Yuuzheng's chest.

Tu Yuuzheng, after enduring countless battles, was no match for Luo Tian—only managing to raise his arms in defense.

"Crack..."

The sound of bones breaking echoed, Tu Yuuzheng's mouth spewed blood as he collided with the five-colored barrier, causing it to tremble.

The others stared at Luo Tian in fear—Tu Yuuzheng was a disciple of the Shuiyuan Sect. This was the Locking Spirit Pagoda, the domain of the Shuiyuan Sect. Luo Tian had dared to strike his disciple—what else could he not do?

"What is this man made of! Killing Tuo Boye, beating Tu Yuuzheng—what else won't he do!" They murmured in their hearts.

"Such is the true cultivator!" Feng Tianxiong muttered, his face filled with admiration.

Hearing Feng Tianxiong's words, the black-cloaked men under Leng Qiuchan bore expressions of reverence, nodding in agreement. Cultivators should act thus—quickly repaying kindness and hatred, regardless of sects.

"Still not done!" Pang Haoran shouted, watching Luo Tian approach Tu Yuuzheng step by step like a sovereign.

At this moment, in the Locking Spirit Pagoda, Luo Tian was essentially invincible—regardless of his cultivation level. Simply by being the master of the Locking Spirit Pagoda, no one could match him.

Luo Tian knelt beside Tu Yuuzheng, smiling: "Don't think because you're a disciple of the Shuiyuan Sect I won't touch you!"

A yellow-grade long sword emerged from his storage ring, and he raised it toward Tu Yuuzheng's wrist. A stream of blood spurted out.

Luo Tian's spiritual awareness moved, entering Tu Yuuzheng's wound and flowing through his blood vessels. While doing this, Pang Haoran and others dared not breathe.

"Found!" Luo Tian's spiritual awareness moved again, finally locating Tu Yuuzheng's heart through the blood flow.

With a spiritual awareness movement, three doses of essence blood returned along the blood vessels from his wrist.

Tu Yuuzheng was immobilized, his face pale—three doses of essence blood were a severe blow. He himself had only ten doses in total; now, three were taken by Luo Tian, leaving him furious.

More infuriating was the humiliation Luo Tian had bestowed upon him. He was a proud man; even when Chen Changsheng had taken the Heaven-Shaking Mirror, he hadn't lost his will to win. But encountering Luo Tian was perhaps his misfortune.

The loss of three doses of essence blood left Tu Yuuzheng utterly defeated, his face pale. Though his wrist wound had healed due to his body's nature, the events of these days had left an indelible mark on him.

Not only Tu Yuuzheng, but others felt the same—especially Ying Hongtu, who had been plagued by bad luck since meeting Luo Tian. Now, Luo Tian seemed like a demon that had taken root in his heart.

"Alright, you can come yourself or I'll do it myself," Luo Tian said, sealing the three doses of essence blood into a jade vial.

A cultivator's essence blood was precious—whether for refining elixirs or through special methods, it could be transformed into cultivation.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, others bore a flicker of struggle—but after these days' interactions, they knew Luo Tian was the kind to follow through.

"I'll do it myself!"
Pang Haoran's face turned red, his teeth gritted.

"I'll do it myself too!"
With Pang Haoran's lead, others also spoke reluctantly.

At this moment, they were utterly humiliated—having to offer their essence blood to another person, and even doing it themselves.

Yet they had no choice; the example of Tu Yuuzheng was before them, leaving no room for resistance.

Hearing their words, Luo Tian moved among them, collecting their essence blood.

After finishing, he approached Leng Qiuchan and Feng Tianxiong, handing them several jade vials: "Take these—rest up."

Chapter 235: The Conclusion

Chapter 235: The Conclusion

Feng Tianxiong accepted the essence blood, his face bearing a complex expression. He secretly thanked himself for not having lost his conscience like Chai Xiangming and others to the earth-level weapon.

Holding the essence blood, Feng Tianxiong bore a sense of admiration. If this Locking Spirit Pagoda's greatest gain was seeing Luo Tian, it taught him that there were always superior individuals beyond one's expectations. Even in the Northern Region, which he had looked down upon, there were prodigies.

The three black-cloaked men behind Leng Qiuchan also bore admiration, unsure when their mistress had become entangled with Luo Tian. Indeed, Luo Tian was exceptional—these men, who had followed Leng Qiuchan for years, had never seen her so devoted to a man.

Yet their faces bore deep concern; due to their status, they knew that Leng Qiuchan and Luo Tian had no chance.

"Alright, you may leave," Luo Tian smiled lightly, commanding the five automatons to disperse the barrier and signaling people could depart.

Tu Yuuzheng, his face pale and heart broken, walked toward the exit as if soulless.

Others also bore sickly faces, trembling as they exited, unwilling to linger a moment longer. They cast one last glance at Luo Tian.

"We should go too; after Chen Changsheng refines the Heaven-Shaking Mirror, we can leave," Luo Tian smiled lightly, stretching his arms and addressing Leng Qiuchan and others.

Naturally, no one objected; they were not talkative individuals. Throughout the journey, only Luo Tian spoke constantly—yet when no one responded, he grew disinterested and eventually fell silent.

...

After Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan left the Tiger Clan, the clan returned to its tranquil life. Their guardian beast, the White Tiger, emerged from the altar and lived among the simple tiger people.

One day, several young people arrived at the Tiger Clan's mountain village. Leading them was a man and woman; upon seeing the Tiger Clan's village, they wore expressions of awe.

"Saints!" A tiger child saw Luo Tian and shouted, running into the village.

"The saints have come!" The clear voice of a child echoed through the tranquil village.

As the child's call spread, tiger elders and youth rushed out. A roar echoed—white tigers appeared like lightning before the young people.

"Roar..." The white tiger approached the veiled woman, letting out a low growl.

Hearing the white tiger's low growl, Leng Qiuchan responded with strange sounds.

Hearing Leng Qiuchan's strange call, a tear flowed from the white tiger's eye.

"Uu...!" A green wolf appeared like a young bird returning to its nest, swirling into Leng Qiuchan's arms.

"Little one, do you remember me?" Luo Tian smiled and addressed the green wolf.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the green wolf seemed to see a delicious meal—its mouth drooled.

"Such a greedy little thing! How will you raise it?" Luo Tian smiled, producing an elixir and tossing it into the wolf's mouth.

Feng Tianxiong and the three black-cloaked men watched Luo Tian's actions, their mouths twitching. They sighed internally: "This Luo Tian is truly wasteful!"

The elixir Luo Tian produced smelled of high quality—this man was giving it to a wolf like a pet. To them, this was an extreme waste; after all, the elixir was better than those sold to Tu Yuuzheng and others.

Yet they guessed that Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan must have met in this village.

Soon, Hu Xiucheng's robust figure appeared before Luo Tian and others. His back was a group of tiger clan men and women, old and young.

"Clan Leader Hu Xiucheng greets the two saints!" Hu Xiucheng led the tiger clan people to kneel, respectfully addressing Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan.

"Clan Leader Hu! Why this trouble!" Luo Tian quickly approached Hu Xiucheng, preventing them from kneeling with a powerful spiritual awareness.

Seeing Luo Tian's actions, the tiger clan people's reverence for Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan deepened.

"Clan Leader Hu, we'll stay here for a few days before leaving," Luo Tian said with a complex expression.

"Saints staying among us is our honor!" Hu Xiucheng also bore a complex expression. He naturally knew Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan were not from this world—eventually, they would leave.

"Clan Leader Hu! Let's not return until we're drunk!" Luo Tian patted Hu Xiucheng's strong shoulder, walking into the village with him.

With Luo Tian and others' arrival, the tranquil village once again erupted into revelry. Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan also entered the life of the village.

Time passed swiftly; half a month had slipped by unnoticed.

That day, Luo Tian stood in the courtyard prepared for him by Hu Xiucheng, a light smile on his face. Though distant, he could sense Chen Changsheng's every move at the ninth level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda.

Today, the entire Locking Spirit Pagoda radiated golden light, illuminating the cave chamber once more.

Wind stirred; Leng Qiuchan, holding the green wolf in her arms, appeared before Luo Tian. Her black veil obscured her face as she softly asked: "He succeeded?"

"Yes, he did," Luo Tian glanced at Leng Qiuchan and the tiger clan people behind her, a hint of sorrow on his face.

"Then we should leave soon," Leng Qiuchan's eyes also bore a touch of separation.

"Yes, we've stayed long enough—nearly three and a half months. I wonder how the outside world is doing!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

Luo Tian closed his eyes, sensing Chen Changsheng's condition.

At this moment, Chen Changsheng radiated a calm aura, but beneath it, Luo Tian knew his strength had improved significantly. Even now, defeating Chen Changsheng would be challenging—perhaps even surpassing him.

Standing at the ninth level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda, Chen Changsheng opened his eyes, gazing at the Heaven-Shaking Mirror in his hand. A smile graced his face.

With a slight movement of his spiritual awareness, the Heaven-Shaking Mirror shrank under his control until it was palm-sized and rested in his hand.

Closing his eyes, he murmured: "Luo Brother, after I leave, you should store the Locking Spirit Pagoda."

At that moment, Luo Tian's eyes snapped open. He was stunned—how had Chen Changsheng achieved this? How could he have transmitted his voice across such a distance?

Chapter 236: Exiting the Cave Chamber

Chapter 236: Exiting the Cave Chamber

As Chen Changsheng's words ended, his figure instantly appeared before Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan.

"What!" Luo Tian's eyes widened in shock, his face filled with disbelief—clearly, he had not expected Chen Changsheng to possess the ability to teleport.

"Senior Brother Chen, what is this!" Luo Tian asked, his voice trembling with awe.

"There's nothing remarkable about it—just refining the Heaven-Shaking Mirror and mastering the entire cave chamber. That means I am now invincible within this cave!" Chen Changsheng smiled, gazing at Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan.

"Invincible!" Luo Tian's face bore admiration, sighing at how this cave chamber was indeed a treasure. If one could not fight, luring the enemy in would ensure safety.

"Of course, it's for Body-Refining and Bone-Consuming stages. As for the Soul-Soul Stage, no one is foolish enough to enter your cave," Chen Changsheng smiled, explaining.

"That's still great! It's too overpowered—why do I feel this is stronger than the Locking Spirit Pagoda!" Luo Tian spoke, watching the Locking Spirit Pagoda standing for years in the cave chamber. It glowed again, as if bidding farewell to the items within the cave.

Golden light radiated upward into the sky, and the Locking Spirit Pagoda continuously shrank, transforming into a golden light that flew toward them.
