“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with confusion, his gaze sharp as lightning. He sensed the surrounding qi surging toward Qi Daolin’s alchemy furnace at a terrifying speed, his expression cooling slightly.

“Since you insist on playing with fire, I’ll play along!” Luo Tian’s formidable spiritual awareness extended, accelerating the elixir within his furnace.

“Ugh…” As Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness quickened, the elixirs within his furnace spun wildly, their speed surpassing Qi Daolin’s by more than tenfold.

The qi surged violently toward Luo Tian’s furnace, even the qi meant for Qi Daolin’s furnace seemed subtly drawn toward it.

Qi Daolin watched as the qi meant for his own furnace was siphoned away by Luo Tian, his face flushing with embarrassment before a ruthless glint flashed in his eyes. He bit his tongue and spat a stream of blood into the furnace.

“Blood-Fire Elixir Technique! Is Qi Daolin mad? Using such a desperate method!” A senior master’s face darkened, stunned by Qi Daolin’s audacity.

“Blood-Fire Elixir Technique”—as the name suggests, it involves burning one’s own spiritual essence to accelerate elixir formation. However, if mastered poorly, the practitioner risks exhausting their life force, suffering severe injury or even death.

Luo Tian, stunned by Qi Daolin’s desperation, narrowed his eyes in surprise. Yet he merely sneered: “Desperate? Still, it’s futile!”

Saying this, Luo Tian channeled all his spiritual awareness into the furnace. He bellowed: “It’s over!”

“Crash!” Luo Tian slammed both hands onto the furnace, its lid flying off. A few glimmers of light burst forth from the furnace.

Night had fallen, and those glimmers shimmered like stars, rising with a faint glow.

Luo Tian retrieved a jade vial, leaped into the air with a powerful kick, and swiftly collected the glimmers into the vial. His movements flowed seamlessly, leaving the onlookers speechless.

“Elixirs that glow?” A direct disciple stared in disbelief at Luo Tian.

Hearing this, others felt a stir of astonishment. Even the elders on the platform puzzled over why Luo Tian’s elixirs glowed.

“Ah… give me focus!” Before the crowd could react, Qi Daolin, having paid the price of three more streams of blood, finally completed his elixir. Yet he lacked the strength to collect it, collapsing to the ground with a vacant stare as his elixir floated out of the furnace.

“Alas… Qi Daolin, why this struggle?” Lu Kunpeng sighed, swiftly approaching Qi Daolin and snatching the elixir into his jade vial with a wave of his hand.

Chapter 67: First ( )

As Lu Kunpeng collected Qi Daolin’s elixir, the alchemy competition concluded.

Lu Kunpeng sighed again, extending a hand to place an elixir into Qi Daolin’s mouth. Qi Daolin’s pallid face gradually regained color, and he struggled to rise, gazing at Lu Kunpeng with admiration.

When he saw the faint disappointment in Lu Kunpeng’s eyes, Qi Daolin trembled: “Grand Elder… I!”

“You lack the temperament,” Lu Kunpeng said simply before returning to the platform.

Watching Lu Kunpeng’s distant figure, Qi Daolin knew he had lost—though he had won in elixir quality, he had failed in temperament. His desperation to prove himself had led him to undermine others instead of elevating himself.

He slumped onto the ground, watching Luo Tian and Lin Zhengyang with a bitter heart. At over thirty, he had been outmatched by younger men in temperament.

Luo Tian, exhausted, stood there recovering his depleted qi and spiritual awareness. He felt elated—his elixir was complete. Though it held no immediate use for him, once he reached the Bone-Transformation Stage, its power would be extraordinary, solidifying his foundation.

Lin Zhengyang approached Luo Tian with a smile: “I suppose you’ve beaten me again! Respect!”

Luo Tian couldn’t say he disliked Lin Zhengyang, but neither did he particularly like him. He merely offered a humble reply: “Just luck!”

“Alas… your words hurt more than you know,” Lin Zhengyang sighed, rubbing his forehead. Though Luo Tian’s remark had been discouraging, he quickly recovered, recalling how often Luo Tian had humbled him. He chuckled and left.

After Lin Zhengyang departed, others gradually approached Luo Tian to congratulate him.

“This kid’s cultivation talent is absurd; his elixir-making ability seems even greater! A true all-rounder!” The heads of various sects mused, vowing to advise their disciples to befriend Luo Tian if possible, or at least avoid antagonizing him.

“Dong!” As the crowd mused, a heavy bell tolled again.

Lu Kunpeng and other elders stood on the platform, with the chief elder bowing respectfully at the forefront.

“After this evaluation, the elders have determined the top ten rankings, each with their own rewards. Others need not despair—strive for better results next time!” The chief elder spoke with a neutral expression.

“Tenth place: Liu Tianzi, Earth Dragon Elixir, third-grade elixir, 50% of plant essence… ninth place… fifth place…” The chief elder announced the rankings from last to first.

“Third place!” When the chief elder reached third place, his tone paused slightly—unlike the earlier rankings, the rewards for top three were even more enticing, stirring envy among the elders.

“Third place: Lin Zhengyang!” The chief elder’s voice echoed, drawing attention to the unexpected underdog in this alchemy competition.

Lin Zhengyang let out a soft “Hmph,” knowing he had made it into the top three. Yet seeing Luo Tian and Qi Daolin’s spectacle, he suspected they might have pushed him out of second place. Still, a faint hope lingered that he could surpass Qi Daolin’s second place—losing to Luo Tian and Qi Daolin was still a bitter pill.

Standing on the platform, Lin Zhengyang gazed at Luo Tian with a sense of helplessness. This feeling was bitter for a prodigy like him.

“Unexpectedly, Lin Zhengyang, the genius, only secured third place!” The crowd murmured.

“Second place: Qi Daolin!” The chief elder’s voice rang out again, highlighting this alchemy competition’s unexpected contender.

Qi Daolin stared in disbelief. He knew his elixir well, yet it had not subdued Luo Tian—this gnawed at him.

“Qi Daolin’s elixir is a fourth-grade one, named Taiyi Peiyuan Elixir, with 60% of plant essence. Though labeled fourth-grade, it rivals fifth-grade elixirs due to its ability to boost cultivation for those in the Soul-Refinement Stage,” the chief elder explained.

The crowd marveled at Qi Daolin’s elixir, acknowledging his talent despite the unconventional method. After all, every alchemist had their quirks.

“Without Luo Tian, Qi Daolin would have been the star of this alchemy competition. Alas, his misfortune—Luo Tian’s unexpected presence doomed him to be a mere supporting character,” the elders mused, pitying Qi Daolin’s fate.

“The first place of this alchemy competition is Luo Tian!”

“Crash…” Before the chief elder’s words faded, a thunderous applause erupted. From laborers to outer and inner disciples, all clapped for the young man who had dominated the competition with an overwhelming advantage.

At that moment, Luo Tian became the representative of the younger generation in the Alchemy Hall. Having entered for just over two months, he had achieved such a remarkable feat—his peers felt he deserved the applause.

After the applause subsided, the chief elder raised his hand slowly and continued: “Luo Tian’s elixir is a fourth-grade one, but we elders are unsure of its name or effects. That must be explained by Luo Tian himself.”

“I refuse!” Qi Daolin’s voice rang out, laced with deep resentment.

“Are you questioning the elders’ judgment?” A hot-tempered elder snapped.

“Young master dare not, but without knowing the elixir’s name or effects, how can it be ranked first? Young master is still不服!” Qi Daolin bowed respectfully but his eyes burned with defiance.

“Very well! I’ll explain why Luo Tian was ranked first!” The chief elder, unimpressed by Qi Daolin’s attitude, spoke coldly.

“First, previous alchemy competitions were judged based on overall performance across multiple rounds. In the first round, Luo Tian identified a million types of elixirs—his score was top. Do you accept that?” The chief elder’s voice chilled.

“Second, in the second round, Luo Tian employed the late Grand Master’s secret technique—Thousand-Page Brushing Hands. Do you accept that?” Before Qi Daolin could respond, the chief elder continued.

“Third, although Luo Tian’s elixir remains unnamed and its effects unknown, it contains 80% of plant essence. What does that mean? You don’t need me to explain it, do you? Accept or not?” The chief elder regarded Qi Daolin as if he were a fool.

Lu Kunpeng’s eyes flashed with boundless disappointment. He had warned Qi Daolin multiple times, but the latter ignored his words. Turning away, Lu Kunpeng seemed unwilling to look at Qi Daolin again.

The chief elder’s words thundered into Qi Daolin’s ears, shaking his body violently.

“80% of plant essence… 80% of plant essence…” Qi Daolin muttered, his face ashen.

Chapter 68: Moving Lu Kunpeng ()

“80% of plant essence!” The crowd gasped in shock.

“Yes! Exactly 80%! I ask, who among you dares to challenge it?” The chief elder’s cold gaze swept the alchemists.

“I could never produce 80% of plant essence! Perhaps only a few elders could,” the crowd marveled at Luo Tian’s prodigious talent, nearly rivaling the elders.

The elders themselves had been stunned when assessing Luo Tian’s elixir. Though they could produce such an elixir in peak condition, it required years of experience and perfect harmony between intuition and state.

Yet Luo Tian, barely in his twenties, had achieved this—what future awaited him? Who could say he wouldn’t master 90% or even 100% of plant essence?

“I yield,” Qi Daolin admitted, though his heart seethed. The chief elder’s words were undeniable.

“Good! Then Luo Tian, explain the name and effects of this elixir—why have we never seen it before?” The chief elder asked, drawing all eyes to Luo Tian.

“This elixir is called Seven-Star Bone-Refining Elixir! A fourth-grade elixir. Its purpose? When consumed by those in the Bone-Refinement Stage, it doesn’t greatly enhance cultivation but allows them to refine their seven bones seven times, strengthening their foundation and increasing chances of success when entering the Soul-Refinement Stage,” Luo Tian said calmly.

“What? Increasing chances of success in the Soul-Refinement Stage!” The crowd gasped, staring at Luo Tian’s crystalline elixir. Especially the sect heads, their eyes gleamed with greed.

The Soul-Refinement Stage was a pivotal milestone in cultivation, stalling countless aspirants. Lu Kunpeng himself had been stuck at the Bone-Refinement peak for years, despite his devotion to alchemy.

“By how much does it increase success rates?” The Flame Sect head, Si Tu Anle, asked excitedly.

“If taken at the onset of Bone-Refinement Stage, it increases success by 20%. The later one takes it, the lower the chance,” Luo Tian bowed in reply.

A chorus of gasps echoed as the crowd stared at Luo Tian, stunned. Though 20% seemed small, few treasures on Tianyuan Continent could boost Soul-Refinement chances. Most were even less effective than this Seven-Star Bone-Refining Elixir.

At that moment, the crowd regarded Luo Tian as a priceless treasure, their eyes glowing. Even Lei Yong’s gaze was alight with desire, envisioning countless spiritual stones beckoning him.

“May I request a single elixir from you, young master?” Si Tu Anle spoke first, hoping Luo Tian would sell him one. His disciple was at the Cultivation Body Nine Stage and needed this elixir for a breakthrough.

“Pardon my impertinence, but this elixir cannot be sold. I intend to gift it—currently, I have no plans to sell. However, if you wish, Brother Duan can send the herbs here, and I’ll craft one for you. As for price, I’ll offer a 30% discount!” Luo Tian said humbly.

“My heavens! Has the world gone mad? The Flame Sect head seeks an elixir from a junior, yet is refused—even with a 30% discount?” The crowd felt their values unravel.

Si Tu Anle was stunned by Luo Tian’s refusal, surprised the latter didn’t grant him face. Yet he suppressed his anger—being a fire-element adept, he understood elixirs well and was himself a fifth-grade alchemist. He knew the significance of this Seven-Star Bone-Refining Elixir.

“These three elixirs are for my three elder brothers—thank you for your past kindness!” Luo Tian handed the elixirs to Zhang Ziping and his brothers.

Zhang Ziping’s eyes softened with approval. Though he didn’t need the elixir, he recognized Luo Tian’s sincerity and accepted it without refusal.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen were already in the Bone-Refinement Stage, though at mid-level. Though their results would be slightly diminished, the elixirs still held great value.

“These two are for Master Mu of the Greenwood Sect and Master Wu of the Venomous Sect—thank you both for caring for my friends!” Luo Tian’s voice rang again.

Mu Nianqing was surprised but smiled, accepting the elixir: “When will you visit my Greenwood Sect? Qianxue has been longing for you! If it weren’t for this critical breakthrough, she might have already come to find you!”

Hearing Mu Nianqing’s words, Luo Tian’s heart stirred. He resolved to visit the girl after this competition—longing for her, he hadn’t seen her in a while.

“Haha! Si Tu, you’ve lost this time! I never thought I’d gain such a good disciple!” Seeing Si Tu Anle humiliated by Luo Tian, yet the latter gifted him one elixir, Wu Ping’an burst into laughter. He mused whether to have Gu Lei bitten by two venomous snakes.

Seeing Wu Ping’an’s smugness, Si Tu Anle’s face reddened, but he could do nothing. Without a disciple connected to Luo Tian, he could only watch his old rival Wu Ping’an gloat.

“This final elixir is for Grand Elder Lu of the Alchemy Hall—my teacher’s gratitude. Thank you, Grand Elder, for your years of dedication to the Alchemy Hall and the art!” Luo Tian bowed, presenting the elixir to Lu Kunpeng.

Hearing this, Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen also bowed respectfully. Though Zhang Ziping was now the Alchemy Hall’s Grand Master, Lu Kunpeng was his elder. Moreover, Lu Kunpeng had indeed devoted much to the Alchemy Hall. Thus, this bow was deserved.

“This!” Lu Kunpeng’s expression was complex, his heart a whirlwind. He recalled the bet he had made with Luo Tian.

Lu Kunpeng knew Luo Tian was telling him he didn’t care about the bet, so no apology was needed. Luo Tian respected him in his heart and had shown deference publicly.

Chapter 69: Before Seclusion ()

As Luo Tian and his three elder brothers bowed, Lu Kunpeng’s inner turmoil dissolved. He mused: “Indeed, the Grand Master’s disciple—well done! If I’m not satisfied now, then I’ve lived my life in vain!”

With this thought, Lu Kunpeng quickly helped the four brothers up, smiling: “Well done! The Grand Master didn’t misjudge!”

The elders knew Lu Kunpeng had now accepted Zhang Ziping as Grand Master. From this point, the Alchemy Hall would be more united. Lu Kunpeng’s acceptance of Zhang Ziping meant the approval of the eight thousand inner disciples.

The crowd now instinctively gazed at Luo Tian, admiration in their eyes. Without him, this shift might have taken much longer.

“Haha! Well then, let’s declare the end of this alchemy competition!” Lu Kunpeng laughed heartily, announcing the conclusion.

……

After the alchemy competition ended, Luo Tian’s fame spread throughout the Alchemy Hall.

With his Thousand-Page Brushing Hands exposed, people knew Luo Tian’s earlier actions of plunging into oil were training for this technique.

Soon, every courtyard began setting up oil pots, the scent of meat wafting through the Alchemy Hall’s peaks. Other sects thought the Alchemy Hall was using living beings for elixirs, prompting their heads to visit the Five Elements Sect. Upon confirming no human sacrifices, they returned with twitching mouths.

This angered Lu Kunpeng. Luo Tian’s training method was valid, yet others had no idea and dared to imitate it—without benefit, they risked injury. Lu Kunpeng’s fury combined with the lack of results led alchemists to abandon this self-harming practice. Luo Tian, however, felt helpless.

……

Seven days later, Luo Tian completed the three elixirs he had promised to make. He stretched his arms: “Hmph, I’ll check on Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, then follow my elder brothers into seclusion. Let’s strive to improve further—this will increase our chances of entering the Flying Cloud Sect!”

Luo Tian tidied up briefly and headed toward the Venomous Sect……

The Venomous Sect was a unique presence within the Five Elements Sect, rarely visited due to its terrifying reputation. Imagine walking along a path when suddenly a venomous snake darts out and bites you—how would you feel? After defeating the snake, you’d face thousands more drawn by its blood.

Luo Tian now walked this path, the Venomous Sect’s population being the smallest among the peaks. This meant no one lived below the mid-slope, with all venomous sect disciples residing at the summit.

Luo Tian sighed at the sight of insects scurrying, pitying Gu Lei’s life in such an environment. He gathered his strength: “Gu Lei! I’m here! Are you welcoming me like this?”

“Haha! Luo Tian, how’s it? This is my sect’s way of welcoming guests!” A figure descended from the mid-slope.

Luo Tian recognized the figure but was stunned—this wasn’t the Gu Lei he knew. The man before him had a fit body, not the plump one he remembered.

Luo Tian scrutinized the figure, catching a faint resemblance to Gu Lei. He asked hesitantly: “Are you Gu Lei?”

“Haha! Of course! How could I not be recognized now that I’ve slimmed down? Am I too handsome for you to notice?” Gu Lei, seeing Luo Tian’s surprise, gave him a big hug.

“How did you slim down so much?” Luo Tian asked, confirming his suspicion.

“Ugh…” Hearing Luo Tian’s question, Gu Lei let out a sob, recalling his past months. Seeing Luo Tian felt like seeing family, and he wore a pained expression.

“You’ve been bitten by various venomous creatures and forced to eat poison, of course you’d slim down! Ugh…” Gu Lei sobbed, recounting his two months’ ordeal to Luo Tian. The story made Luo Tian’s hair stand on end.

It turned out, Gu Lei was bitten by a venomous snake on his first day and collapsed. The next day, two bites; thereafter, the number doubled daily. He spent a month in unconsciousness.

After surviving, Gu Lei’s resistance to poison improved. Wu Ping’an then taught him a technique, and his meals became various venomous insects and meat. Seeing the repulsive food, Gu Lei’s appetite waned but he ate under Wu Ping’an’s threats. Afterward, he was forced to refine the blood and essence into his body.

“Luo Tian, you don’t know what I’ve endured! I wanted to eat braised pork, but this old man said it would hinder my cultivation and forbade me. I’ve been eating these venomous creatures for two months—I’m about to vomit!” Gu Lei cried.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, his face darkening. He hadn’t expected Gu Lei to live such a life: “I’ll find a way for you to join the Alchemy Hall!”

“Nah, besides poor food, this old man treats me well. I can feel he truly sees me as a disciple. I’m just venting—alas, I’m not like you with such a good body. This old man said I have ‘Convergent Venom Body’—though I don’t know what it is, I can sense it’s powerful. Only this old man could teach me! My strength has surged these months!” Gu Lei, upon mentioning his cultivation, wore a proud expression.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian was surprised—hadn’t noticed Gu Lei’s cultivation before. Upon hearing this, he sensed it carefully.

“Cultivation Body Six!” Luo Tian exclaimed in shock, marveling at the boy’s speed. He had only reached Cultivation Body Seven through elixirs, yet Gu Lei had achieved Six in two months. Two months ago, he was only at Cultivation Body Four!

Seeing Luo Tian’s shock, Gu Lei beamed with pride. He patted Luo Tian’s shoulder and said earnestly: “Luo Tian, you must try harder! If I surpass you, it’ll be embarrassing. I’ll even beat you!”

Hearing Gu Lei’s boast, Luo Tian smiled: “Convergent Venom Body? That’s impressive. I didn’t know you had such ambition! Come on, I’ll grant your wish and let you beat me!”

“Wait until my cultivation catches up! Hmph… What are you doing, Tian? Ah… Brother Tian, I’m sorry! I was just joking!” A chorus of cries echoed from the mid-slope of the Venomous Sect……

Chapter 70: Meeting Gu Qianxue ()

Within the Five Elements Sect, the Greenwood Sect was the one with the most female disciples, two-thirds of its members being women.

At that moment, on the back mountain of the Greenwood Sect, a woman in an ink-green gown smiled slightly. Her body radiated Cultivation Body Eight energy, shaking the surrounding trees.

“Ah! Master Qianxue has broken through again!” A clear female voice echoed, as a tall, pretty woman stepped into the forest. Though Gu Qianxue was already considered tall among women, this woman stood half a head taller.

“Qingzhu Senior Sister, don’t mock me! My cultivation isn’t worthy of your eyes!” Gu Qianxue smiled at her senior.

“Hmph, I never reached your speed. Are you trying to meet that alchemy prodigy?” Qingzhu teased.

“No!” Gu Qianxue blushed, feebly denying it—everyone could see her thoughts.

“Ah! Mentioning your heart’s desire, you’re shy!” Ning Qingzhu teased further.

“I’m the one who wants to meet him! Why do you blame me?” Gu Qianxue retaliated.

“Why? I like Ji Chen’s icy blockhead! Bite me if you dare! Everyone in the Greenwood Sect knows that, silly girl. You must fight for a good man or you’ll cry later!” Ning Qingzhu, unembarrassed, openly admitted her feelings.

“But…” Gu Qianxue clearly couldn’t match Ning Qingzhu, stammering.

“Alright! No more teasing. The outer disciples reported two people wanting to see you—apparently, one is the Five Elements Body prodigy!” Ning Qingzhu decided to reveal their purpose.

“Really?” Gu Qianxue gasped, vanishing before Ning Qingzhu’s eyes.

“This girl… really…” Ning Qingzhu sighed, watching Gu Qianxue’s retreating figure.

“Alas… this Five Elements Body, you’re in for a tough time. Our Greenwood Sect’s men aren’t easy to deal with… but there’ll definitely be a show…” Ning Qingzhu smiled, chasing after Gu Qianxue.

At the base of the Greenwood Sect, Luo Tian and Gu Lei sat idly on the steps. Gu Lei had a black eye, while Luo Tian’s face was dark.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected Gu Lei’s venomous skills to be so high—he had been tricked without realizing it. During the scolding, his stomach had suddenly ached. Fortunately, his strong body forced Gu Lei to hand over the antidote; otherwise, he’d have been worse off.

“Luo Tian, you came to the Wood Sect before, why didn’t you get in?” Gu Lei asked.

“I did come! But they invited me to make elixirs, and inner disciples led me in. How else could I have entered?” Luo Tian sighed helplessly. He had visited the Wood Sect several times before, but coincidentally always caught Gu Qianxue in seclusion.

“Haha! Brother Luo, why didn’t you inform me before coming to the Greenwood Sect? I’d have met you!” A cheerful voice echoed.

“Indeed! Brother Luo, you’re unkind! Tonight we must get drunk!” Another voice followed.

“Not that I’m here to visit an old friend, so I didn’t disturb you, Master Zhong! Master Wang, please forgive me!” Luo Tian smiled at the two figures descending from the mountain.

The two were inner disciples of the Greenwood Sect who had previously asked Luo Tian to make elixirs—Luo Tian got along well with them.

After introducing Gu Lei, who was naturally lively, he quickly became friends with the two. Upon hearing Luo Tian and Gu Lei’s purpose, they frowned.

Luo Tian noticed their hesitation and asked softly: “Brothers, speak freely. Is it about Gu Qianxue?”

“Not exactly. Gu Qianxue is a direct disciple of the sect head, so she’s respected here—no mishaps. However…” Zhong Kaiyang hesitated.

“I’ll explain,” Wang Borong continued, “a senior disciple of a sect elder named Pei Letian has long regarded Gu Qianxue as his territory. Any male disciple who dares to associate with her gets warned by Pei Letian to stay away. I think you understand now.”

“Recently, a disciple of mine who spoke a few words with Gu Qianxue was punished by Pei Letian,” Zhong Kaiyang recounted, his eyes burning with anger.

Hearing this, Luo Tian and Gu Lei frowned—displeased with Pei Letian’s actions. Luo Tian asked softly: “What cultivation level is he at?”

“Water and Wood dual-element, Cultivation Body Nine. Though it’s Cultivation Body Nine, the Greenwood Sect disciples know Pei Letian is far stronger than average. He’s held back his cultivation to break through at the Bone-Refinement Stage.” Zhong Kaiyang replied.

“Haha! Luo Tian, it’s not easy to be my brother-in-law!” Gu Lei teased.

“Smack!” Luo Tian hit Gu Lei’s head, calculating his chances against Pei Letian. After a while, he felt his odds were slim unless he reached Cultivation Body Eight.

“Luo Tian!” A clear voice echoed, laced with excitement, interrupting Luo Tian’s thoughts.

Under the amazed gazes of Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong, Gu Qianxue approached the four.

“Sister!” Gu Lei called out, drawing Gu Qianxue’s attention to him.

“Are you… Gu Lei?” Clearly, Gu Qianxue didn’t recognize the slimmed-down Gu Lei, her face hesitant.

“I’m your brother, Gu Lei!” Gu Lei showed off his slim figure proudly, eyes gleaming.

“Hmph, good!” Gu Qianxue nodded at the slimmed-down Gu Lei before turning her gaze to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian also gazed at Gu Qianxue, their eyes locking in silence. Neither spoke for a moment.

Gu Lei had just heard Gu Qianxue say “good” and was waiting for her next words. Yet after a while, none came—so he turned around and saw the two locking eyes. He opened his mouth but wisely closed it again.

“How are you adjusting to this place?” Luo Tian finally broke the silence, asking gently.

“Very well!” Gu Qianxue smiled, like a flower blooming in spring, leaving Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong speechless.

Before they could continue, an discordant voice echoed: “Qianxue Senior Sister, why didn’t you inform us of your visitors? We’d like to show hospitality!”

Chapter 71: Pei Letian ()

As the voice echoed, a tall young man descended from the mountain with several disciples who looked down on him.

“Senior Brother Pei? What brings you here?” Gu Qianxue, seeing the visitor, felt puzzled but smiled politely.

Pei Letian’s actions were unknown to Gu Qianxue; he appeared gentle and cared for her, so she didn’t dislike him. Yet hearing his words implied closeness, which made her uneasy—afraid Luo Tian might misunderstand.

“I heard Qianxue Senior Sister has visitors, so I wish to show hospitality!” Pei Letian said gently. Though he claimed to want to befriend them, his eyes didn’t even glance at Luo Tian and the others.

Luo Tian felt uneasy hearing Pei Letian’s words, especially seeing his aloof gaze. This reminded Luo Tian of Li Xiuping from the Flying Cloud Sect—Pei Letian’s gaze was identical to Li Xiuping’s.

“Qianxue, since he’s your senior brother, let’s join him!” Luo Tian smiled and stepped in front of Gu Qianxue, grabbing her jade hand.

Gu Qianxue hadn’t expected it and shivered slightly before trying to pull away. But Luo Tian wouldn’t let go, his hand gently tightening.

Gu Qianxue’s face turned red—though they had touched before, it was always for a reason. This was the first time she’d been formally touched in front of so many people.

Gu Lei, watching Luo Tian’s move, was stunned, smiling inwardly: “Luo Tian, you’re bold! This is too direct. You’ve never seen my sister so shy before!”

Ning Qingzhu, hiding in the shadows, widened her eyes then glowed with excitement: “Good for you! Not a bad choice for Qianxue. But there’ll be more drama ahead!”

Zhong Kaiyang and Wang Borong stared in shock at Luo Tian’s bold move, surprised he dared to grab Gu Qianxue’s hand in front of Pei Letian. They worriedly glanced at Pei Letian.

A crack formed under Pei Letian’s feet as he glared at Luo Tian, his face dark. He often punished disciples who spoke too much to Gu Qianxue—today, someone had grabbed the hand he longed for. His heart was filled with anger.

“Boy! Can you touch Qianxue Senior Sister’s hand?” One of Pei Letian’s disciples coldly addressed Luo Tian, knowing this was the time to flatter their master.

Hearing his disciple’s words, Pei Letian turned and nodded approvingly at Zhang Hanlin, signaling him to continue.
