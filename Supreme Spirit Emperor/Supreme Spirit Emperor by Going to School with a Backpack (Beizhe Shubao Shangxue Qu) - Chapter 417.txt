“Get out…” As Luo Tian had just lain down on the bed, a cold voice echoed from outside the door. Four figures stood at the entrance, causing Luo Tian to instantly leap up and glance toward the doorway.

This glimpse was enough—seeing the four figures standing outside, Luo Tian's heart swelled with joy. He silently sighed: “My mother truly is the most capable mother in the world!”

Though four figures were present, Zhang Qiu Yue was absent. Instead, it was Fu Xingxuan in a purple robe.

The sight of four beautiful women standing before him instantly filled Luo Tian with exhilaration, his legs even recovering their strength.

What delighted Luo Tian most was that Fu Xingxuan now stood among the three, and their relationship had clearly improved.

“Mother, what method did you use?” Luo Tian marveled at Zhang Qiu Yue’s ingenuity.

“Your wives have returned!” Luo Tian smiled sycophantically, trembling as he stepped off the bed. His knees oozed more blood.

“Get out. You don’t need to kneel tomorrow,” Jiang Sxi coldly said, then kicked Luo Tian out.

Before flying away, Luo Tian saw Fu Xingxuan winking playfully at him, calming his heart.

“Boom…” Luo Tian landed awkwardly on the ground. In his ears rang laughter from within the room, and his heart bloomed with joy.

“At last, it’s resolved!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Though he didn’t know how Zhang Qiu Yue had convinced Jiang Sxi and the others to accept Fu Xingxuan, the result was good.

“Finally no longer kneeling!” Luo Tian slowly rose, his eyes carrying a hint of joy as he muttered: “Thank you!”

This thank you was not for anyone else—it was for Jiang Sxi, Leng Qiuchan, and Sun Mengru. Luo Tian knew they had suffered greatly.

“Luo Tian!” As Luo Tian muttered to himself, several figures approached him—Xu Liyiying and Zheng Xin.

These two had reunited with their families, then busied themselves cleansing the Tianyuan Continent. After arranging the cleansing of the continent, they regrouped.

“Huh? Luo Tian, why are your knees injured?” They immediately noticed the wounds on his knees and asked.

“Nothing! What did you need me for?” Luo Tian blushed, then spoke to them.

“No problem. Boredom led us to find you for a while. We need something to do; we can’t stay idle forever,” Xu Liyiying said, his face showing a bitter smile.

“Damn it!” Seeing Xu Liyiying, Luo Tian recalled the method Xu had once used to subdue Luo Qingqing. Instantly furious, he leapt toward Xu Liyiying.

“Boom…” The next moment, Luo Tian kicked Xu Liyiying away with a single foot.

“What’s going on?” Zheng Xin and the others were stunned, unsure why Luo Tian had suddenly attacked Xu Liyiying.

“Damn it… What did I do to you? You…” Xu Liyiying’s cry echoed.

After an hour, Luo Tian returned satisfied to the group. Xu Liyiying was bruised and beaten, his eyes filled with resentment.

“I won’t accept it! Why did you hit me!” Xu Liyiying shouted, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Figure it out yourself!” Luo Tian ignored Xu Liyiying’s protest and said to the group: “Let’s go!”

“Brother, you’ve had bad luck. I think Luo Tian’s knee injury is related to you!” Zheng Xin frowned, glancing meaningfully at Leng Qiuchan’s room. The group had already guessed Luo Tian must have suffered greatly with his wives.

“Why did I offend anyone!” Xu Liyiying couldn’t comprehend. If he knew why Luo Tian had attacked him, he would be even more upset.

Laughing and chatting, they arrived at the Great Hall of the Five Elements Sect. After sitting down, they discussed the cleansing of the Tianyuan Continent with Luo Tian, who nodded in agreement.

“Hmm. We need to establish a peak to monitor those people. I’ve already decided on Dong Sansi as the peak leader,” Luo Tian said to them. Everyone knew Dong Sansi’s integrity and trusted him.

“What do we do next?” They then asked Luo Tian about his plans, as the hundred years mentioned by the Ancient King Clan were approaching. The Four Sacred Star Domains would surely prepare.

“I need to go to the Mortal Domain and settle Fu Xingxuan’s affairs. Also, I must visit the Star Roar Domain to see which sects dare to challenge me. You all shouldn’t idle either—go find Zhan Biao and Wan Lingkong, that bastard!” Luo Tian pondered for a moment before revealing his plan.

Chapter 1638: I’ll Help You ()

“Quickly enter the Provisional Epoch Master stage. The great battle is near!” Luo Tian’s gaze deepened, as if he saw the scene of kings rising. In such an era, attaining enlightenment would surely be earth-shattering.

“Do you know where Luo Li is?” Soon after, Luo Tian asked the group about Luo Li’s whereabouts. Thinking of this troublemaker son, Luo Tian felt restless.

“Ha…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the group’s faces turned colorful. They gazed at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, did you also fall for Luo Li’s trick?” Zheng Xin wore a look of schadenfreude, gazing at Luo Tian.

“This kid is a charlatan. He’s always talking nonsense and giving prophecies, but never got it right. I don’t understand how Ji Jiu You could have such a disciple. He even has a Void Body! It’s a waste of such a physique!” Xu Liyiying shook his head, recalling the day he met Luo Li and sighed.

“Come on… You’re not a good pie either!” Hearing Sun Kemin’s words, Luo Tian couldn’t help but curse.

Luo Li was already talking nonsense. If he followed Sun Kemin, becoming a tomb raider and constantly digging into others’ graves, Luo Tian would consider his son wasted.

“First rest for two days. I’ll catch that kid soon!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, thinking of the troublemaker son and feeling restless.

After more merriment, they all dispersed. Luo Tian returned to his residence. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to go to his wives’ rooms; he knew he was still under punishment. If he went, he’d get no benefit. He had just escaped kneeling and didn’t want to provoke his wives again.

“Creak…” Luo Tian opened his door, gazing at the familiar room. He sighed, thinking he had stayed here so few times.

“Ugh… Ugh…” As Luo Tian was sighing, a series of whimpers echoed in his ears. His expression changed slightly.

“Who!” Luo Tian extended a hand, instantly lighting all the candles in the room. The dark chamber became bright, revealing who was making the noise.

On his large bed lay Fu Xingxuan’s purple figure, her eyes darting. She was bound by a rope that had been tied expertly, highlighting her body. This visual impact made Luo Tian unable to resist; he felt a warmth and a stream of heat in his nose.

“What’s going on!” Luo Tian was instantly startled. However, he soon realized Fu Xingxuan’s cultivation had been sealed; otherwise, this rope wouldn’t have restrained her.

Only a few people across the Nine Domains could achieve such silence. Luo Tian, recalling Fu Xingxuan’s previous presence with Jiang Sxi and the others, immediately knew who had done it.

“Truly my good wife. Did she fear Xingxuan’s shyness?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, seeing such a beautiful woman before him. If he had no thoughts, he wouldn’t be a man.

“Not right—there must be a trick!” However, Luo Tian immediately thought the three wouldn’t let him off so easily and regained his clarity.

“Xingxuan, is it painful?” Luo Tian smiled, then wore a kind expression. He sent out his vast spiritual sense to check the room for any tricks, feeling puzzled.

“Not right—this might be a test!” Luo Tian bit his tongue to stay alert, then approached the bed.

“I’ll untie you!” Luo Tian looked at the knots on Fu Xingxuan’s body, smiling as he untied her ropes.

Intentionally, the knots were tied at sensitive spots on Fu Xingxuan’s body. Luo Tian naturally took advantage, making Fu Xingxuan’s face red as if bleeding.

“Huh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, secretly admiring the feel while observing Fu Xingxuan’s red face.

“Stay calm… Stay calm…” Luo Tian mentally sighed. Fu Xingxuan now resembled a ripe apple, tempting one to pluck it.

“Definitely something’s wrong…” Luo Tian decided, then untied Fu Xingxuan’s sealed cultivation.

“Luo… Luo Tian…” Fu Xingxuan could now speak, but her face remained rosy.

“Xingxuan, what’s wrong?” Luo Tian looked at Fu Xingxuan’s red face and his expression changed. He felt something was off.

“I’m so hot…” Fu Xingxuan, her face red, rubbed against Luo Tian’s body and twisted slightly.

Fu Xingxuan was also confused. She had drunk some wine with Jiang Sxi and the others, then felt sleepy and fell asleep. When she awoke, her cultivation was sealed, and she found herself here.

When Luo Tian touched her earlier, she felt a surge of heat and longing—something she had never experienced before.

“This…” Luo Tian looked at Fu Xingxuan’s red face, touched her forehead, and his expression changed. He felt Fu Xingxuan’s state was familiar.

“Damn…” Luo Tian’s face changed, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“Aphrodisiac!” Luo Tian’s expression darkened, realizing why Fu Xingxuan was in this state.

“I’m uncomfortable…” Fu Xingxuan kept speaking, grabbing Luo Tian’s hand, making him groan he couldn’t resist.

“What to do? These girls played too big!” Luo Tian mentally cursed his wives for being reckless. If it went wrong, it would be a big problem.

“Xingxuan, is it uncomfortable?” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, looking at Fu Xingxuan’s suffering. He emitted waves to stay alert and then placed his cold hand on Fu Xingxuan’s head.

“Hmm…” The cold energy passed through Fu Xingxuan, slightly improving her condition. However, she remained rosy.

“I’ll help you…” Luo Tian then gritted his teeth. He didn’t want to take advantage of Fu Xingxuan’s state, but he had his methods.

“Hmm…” Fu Xingxuan nodded. Suddenly, the candles in the room dimmed, plunging it into darkness but with a hint of springtime.

Meanwhile, Jiang Sxi and the others sat in Leng Qiuchan’s room, gazing at each other.

“Sxi sister, do you think Luo Tian would directly…” Leng Qiuchan’s face was red, her eyes filled with a touch of shyness.

“If he truly took Xingxuan while清醒, I’d castrate him!” Jiang Sxi coldly said.

“Would it harm Xingxuan’s body?” Sun Mengru looked worried. If something harmed Fu Xingxuan, they would be guilty.

“It’s fine. This is what Gu Lei left for me. It won’t cause problems. Gu Lei, that bastard, knows a lot about this! The effect isn’t too strong, and there are no side effects. It’ll be fine after a while!” Jiang Sxi shook her head.

“That’s good!” Hearing Jiang Sxi, Sun Mengru and Leng Qiuchan nodded. However, their gazes toward Jiang Sxi changed.

“Sxi sister, why did you ask Gu Lei for this?” Sun Mengru smiled.

“I…” Hearing Sun Mengru’s words and seeing Leng Qiuchan’s gaze, Jiang Sxi blushed. She had wanted this for Luo Tian to use and then…

“Two little girls, daring to mock me!” Jiang Sxi then realized, grabbing Sun Mengru’s arm and laughter echoing in the room.

Morning sunlight poured in. Luo Tian was exhausted, his night truly painful—having a future bride at his mercy but unable to take her.

“Hmm…” Fu Xingxuan, her face rosy, lay like a kitten in Luo Tian’s arms. She thought of the embarrassing scene from last night and felt shy.

“Wake up, don’t pretend to sleep!” Luo Tian felt his discomfort. He bit his tongue again and sat up, but his clothes were intact.

“Feeling better? Rest a bit more!” Luo Tian spoke to Fu Xingxuan, his eyes filled with care. However, he was also happy.

“Cough cough…” As Luo Tian just sat up, a light cough echoed from outside. Jiang Sxi and the others entered, gazing at Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan in bed.

“Luo Tian, you bastard!” Jiang Sxi glared at Fu Xingxuan’s appearance and slapped Luo Tian across the face.

“Hmph…” Sun Mengru and Leng Qiuchan also sneered, approaching Fu Xingxuan.

“You two aren’t officially married yet. How could you do this?” Jiang Sxi coldly said, disappointment in her eyes.

“Sister, Xingxuan is fine.” As Jiang Sxi was about to scold further, Sun Mengru pulled Fu Xingxuan’s white arm out.

Chapter 1639: Calculate Where Your Mother Is ()

“Nothing?” Hearing Leng Qiuchan and Sun Mengru’s words, Jiang Sxi’s face changed. She looked at Luo Tian with suspicion.

“I don’t believe it!” Jiang Sxi approached Fu Xingxuan, who was blushing under the covers. She pulled Fu Xingxuan’s arm to look and saw a red mole on her arm.

This was the mark the three had placed on Fu Xingxuan. If Luo Tian took her, this mark would vanish.

“Still there?” Jiang Sxi’s face showed confusion. She looked at Luo Tian, making him sweat.

“Thankfully I didn’t take Xingxuan!” Luo Tian mentally sighed, praising his own cleverness and smiling.

“I’m not married yet. How could I do that!” Luo Tian softly said, gazing at Jiang Sxi: “Of course, our那次 was an accident.”

“Get out…” Jiang Sxi glared at Luo Tian and then looked at Fu Xingxuan: “Xingxuan, you’ve suffered. From now on, you’re our sister!”

“Hmm…” Fu Xingxuan nodded. Though she had suffered, she felt it was worth it to be accepted by Jiang Sxi and the others.

“Okay, put your clothes on. We’ll wait outside for you!” Jiang Sxi softly said. She could sense Fu Xingxuan’s shyness.

“Haha, Xingxuan sister is shy. Don’t worry; it’ll be fine later!” Sun Mengru smiled, patting Fu Xingxuan’s face. She and Jiang Sxi and Leng Qiuchan walked out of the room.

“Get out, you haven’t seen enough?” Jiang Sxi looked at Luo Tian standing there. Her face was stunned, grabbing his ear and dragging him out of the room.

“Tell me how you did it!” Outside the room, the three women pressed Luo Tian. Though the aphrodisiac’s effect wasn’t strong, breaking it wasn’t easy for Luo Tian.

“Haha, secret. Or shall we try tonight? I’ll demonstrate it myself!” Luo Tian smiled, guessing their anger had subsided. He approached them with a servant’s face.

“Hmph, this time I’ll let you off. If there’s another time, beware of your end!” Jiang Sxi coldly said and glared at Luo Tian before leaving.

“I promise it’s the last time!” Luo Tian quickly promised. Watching them leave, he sighed deeply, feeling like he had shed a layer of skin. These two days were too torturous for Luo Tian.

“Still, at least I’ve made my three wives calm!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He gazed at their slim figures, smiling and thinking about which room to visit tonight.

“First Sxi!” He then confirmed his choice, his eyes filled with confidence. He flew toward the Great Hall of the Five Elements Sect.

“Luo Li, you little bastard. Don’t let me find you!” Luo Tian had nothing to do and thought of the times he was tricked by Luo Li. He gritted his teeth, sending out his vast spiritual sense.

At this moment, Luo Li was holding a girl’s hand, his face showing contentment.

“Beauty, you’ll have an ordeal in the next few days!” Luo Li held the girl’s hand and spoke, making her face change.

The girl was just an ordinary person. Luo Li had become famous here; everyone who sought his fortune-telling had their predictions come true. Hearing Luo Li’s words, the girl’s face turned pale.

“Semi-Immortal Master, how can I avoid it?” The girl was very pretty. She gazed at Luo Li with a look of求助.

“Don’t worry, I’m here. It should be fine. However….” Luo Li skillfully pinched his fingers, adjusting the shoulder of his torn sail.

“Really?” Hearing Luo Li’s words, the girl’s face showed admiration. She gazed at Luo Li.

“Of course!” Luo Li patted his shoulder, took the money the girl offered, and said: “Tonight…”

“Huh?” However, before Luo Li finished speaking, a wave echoed in the sky. Everyone’s faces showed surprise.

“Crash…” The azure sky was torn open, revealing a white-cloaked man stepping out. He looked like a god.

Everyone was stunned by the scene. This continent in the Four Sacred Star Domains was tiny, filled with ordinary people who had never seen anyone tear open the sky. Seeing this scene, they were all stunned and fearful.

“Immortal! An immortal has descended!” People immediately knelt, bowing to the white-cloaked man in the sky. This man was Luo Tian searching for Luo Li.

“Huh? Semi-Immortal, why is your hand trembling?” The girl who had been held by Luo Li looked surprised. She had been holding his hand, so she could feel it was trembling.

“Did you foresee that you’d have an ordeal today?” The white-cloaked man descended from the sky, his eyes playful as he looked at Luo Li still holding the girl’s hand. His eyes flashed anger.

“Father…” Luo Li smiled, gazing at the white-cloaked man. He quickly released the girl’s hand and respectfully looked at Luo Tian.

“Get back!” Luo Tian coldly said, grabbing Luo Li and turning into a flash of light, disappearing from everyone’s sight.

“Wow…”

“Luo Semi-Immortal truly is an immortal!” People exclaimed, gazing respectfully at the gradually healing sky.

“She’s blessed by immortals!” Then people turned their gaze to the girl Luo Li had held, showing respect.

In the Five Elements Sect of the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian didn’t care about the small incident caused by his appearance. An hour later, he brought Luo Li back to the Five Elements Sect.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian threw the bound Luo Li onto the ground, making him scream.

“You little bastard. Learned to trick your father?” Luo Tian glared at Luo Li, anger rising. Especially recalling the pain he had endured and the scene of this kid in that continent.

“Tell me, did you do anything against heaven and earth?” Luo Tian looked at Luo Li. If this kid wasn’t disciplined, the consequences would be severe. He also felt guilty toward Gu Qianxue.

“No… no, father, I dare not. I just took some small advantages. I’m already this big and don’t have a wife yet. Tell me, when you were my age, did you already have sisters?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Luo Li’s face changed. He knew Luo Tian’s temper well; if he touched Luo Tian’s底线, his son would be punished.

“You what? Master Ji taught you to deceive?” Luo Tian heard Luo Li’s excuse and felt a little better. However, his face turned stern.

“You’re wrong! Isn’t that deception?” Hearing Luo Li’s explanation, Luo Tian’s face slightly straightened. This kid had been deceiving people since childhood—it wasn’t good.

But Luo Tian forgot that Luo Li was now of age, a big young man, no longer the child who clung to him.

“Father, you’re wrong. I can still see some clues. In this profession, fortune-telling is part of it, but deception is another level. You can foresee a person’s future misfortune, but if they don’t believe you, it’s all for nothing. Therefore, deception is also a form of cultivation. When I can deceive the heavens, my art of deceiving heaven will be complete!” Luo Li explained seriously to Luo Tian.

“Deceiving Heaven Art?” Hearing Luo Li’s words, Luo Tian’s eyebrows slightly furrowed. He had heard of this art and seen it before. When the soul-eating silkworm was still young, it used this art to evade a heavenly trial. However, Luo Tian hadn’t expected that Luo Li, in his tricks and deceits, was actually cultivating such a great art.

“Did Master Ji teach you this?” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion, but he believed it half-heartedly. He didn’t want his son to become like Ji Jiu You, who eventually went blind and claimed he was cultivating a third eye.

“Yes, it was Master’s teaching. My master is truly remarkable!” Luo Li looked worshipful. This expression, Luo Tian had only seen when others spoke of himself.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. His voice carried helplessness, then gazed at Luo Li: “Son, but these aren’t reasons for you to trick your father!”

“Father… when did I trick you? How did I trick you? Don’t mention anything else. When you go east, have you passed your trial?” Luo Li’s face instantly showed委屈.

“Ugh…” Hearing Luo Li’s words, Luo Tian’s face paused. Though he had been beaten and suffered some pain, it was indeed as Luo Li said—three days passed.

“Okay, I forgive you. But you must promise me a few conditions: first, no doing anything against heaven and earth; second, no self-harm; third, no…” Luo Tian spoke for several conditions, making Luo Li’s face fall.

“Don’t you agree?” Seeing Luo Li’s face, Luo Tian’s expression darkened, his eyes filled with threat.

“Agree… agree…” Seeing Luo Tian’s gaze, Luo Li yielded under Luo Tian’s淫威 and became listless.

“Last condition: calculate where your mother is. If you can, I’ll let you continue learning this Deceiving Heaven Art; otherwise, no deal!” Luo Tian then smiled, gazing at Luo Li.

Chapter 1640: Jiang Nanxuan Returns ()

“Your mother?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Luo Li’s face showed sadness. Though Jiang Sxi and the others were like a mother to him, filial piety connected them. Luo Li still longed for Gu Qianxue.

“Yes, can you calculate it?” Luo Tian’s face showed hope. He had once wanted to ask Ji Jiu You to calculate Gu Qianxue’s whereabouts, but at that time, Ji Jiu You was healing Fu Xingxuan. Luo Tian didn’t dare to ask. When he returned, Ji Jiu You had already entered meditation and became this state.

“I calculated it. When I was small, I calculated it. But the cost was that I lay in bed for a month, my blood and qi almost drained by an unknown force!” Luo Li’s face showed fear, recalling the scene.

“Sigh…” Hearing Luo Li’s words, Luo Tian’s face changed. He hadn’t expected Luo Li to pay such a heavy price.

“I could only determine that your mother isn’t in the Nine Domains. As for where she is, I truly don’t know.” Luo Li sighed longingly.

“Paid such a heavy price to only determine she’s not in the Nine Domains. Did Qianxue really ascend into immortality?” Luo Tian’s heart sank. If he couldn’t become an immortal, would he never see Gu Qianxue again?

“Immortality. Even if I have to search the heavens and hell, I’ll find you!” Luo Tian mentally whispered, his eyes filled with determination.

“Okay, stop being absent-minded. The world is chaotic now. Stay in the Tianyuan Continent and spend time with your great-grandfather, grandfather, and others!” Luo Tian softly said. He didn’t reclaim the items he had given to Luo Li before. Those items weren’t important for him now, as he was already a Provisional Epoch Master. Few in the Nine Domains could harm him. But for Luo Li, those items were life-saving.

However, Luo Tian had confidence in his son’s survival skills. After all, he was a Void Body and a favorite of space. Even catching this kid would take much effort.

“Father, I’ll go first!” Luo Li showed respect and then walked out of the courtyard.

“Okay, go. Remember my conditions!” Luo Tian nodded without looking at Luo Li. However, he didn’t notice that when Luo Li turned around, his face showed a victorious smile.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian watched Luo Li leave and sighed deeply, then went to Jiang Sxi’s room.

“Sxi, I’m here to tell you how I removed the aphrodisiac from Xingxuan! Ha, they’re all here. Let’s tell them together!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in Leng Qiuchan’s room, filled with excitement.

“Get out…” A cold voice echoed in the room. However, Luo Tian wasn’t kicked out.

In the following days, Luo Tian lived comfortably. By day, he chatted with Zheng Xin and Xu Liyiying; by night, he talked heart-to-heart with his wives. The only regret was that Fu Xingxuan hadn’t been tempted.

Time flowed slowly. Luo Tian had stayed in the Tianyuan Continent for a month when two figures appeared outside it.

“Back?” Luo Tian was teaching his three disciples. When the two figures appeared outside the Tianyuan Continent, his face slightly changed. He smiled and vanished from the sight of the younger disciples.

At the same time, others also flew out of the Tianyuan Continent into the star domain. They gazed at the two figures standing outside it.

The two were Jiang Nanxuan and Gu Lei, who hadn’t returned for a long time. Before Luo Tian and the others returned, they had infiltrated the Thunder Domain to investigate the movements of the Burial Coffin. After such a long time, they had returned.

“Luo Tian, you’ve returned?” Jiang Nanxuan’s face showed fatigue. He looked at Luo Tian and the others, but his aura remained calm.

“Ha! Zheng Xin, you bastards. Come on, fight three hundred rounds with Gu Lei!” Before Luo Tian could respond, Gu Lei laughed loudly and shouted at Xu Liyiying and the others.

“Damn it! Gu Lei, you’ve advanced!” Hearing Gu Lei’s thunderous voice, Xu Liyiying and the others showed disbelief.

“Sky is unjust! This fake medicine seller has become a Provisional Epoch Master!” Sun Keming and the others groaned.

“Ha! Can’t help it. Gu Elder’s talent is exceptional!” Gu Lei smiled with pride, then looked at Luo Tian.

“Am I the third Provisional Epoch Master in our Four Sacred Star Domains?” Gu Lei looked at Zheng Xin and the others, his eyes showing contempt.

“Truly annoying!” Seeing Gu Lei’s smug face, Zheng Xin and the others gritted their teeth. They wanted to use their shoes to have a close encounter with that face.

“Who dares to fight? Diao Dezhu, you claimed to be undefeated among peers. And you, Xiao Yanjun, I’ve always disliked your looks. How dare you be more handsome than me! Come on, fight with me!” Gu Lei smiled proudly, looking invincible.

“Gu Lei, don’t laugh. Someone can control you!” Diao Dezhu gritted his teeth and took out his identity token, transmitting a message.

“Monkey Brother, found a Provisional Epoch Master. Hurry! If you don’t come soon, he’ll escape!” Diao Dezhu transmitted to the identity token, his eyes filled with mockery.

Hearing Diao Dezhu’s transmission, everyone on the Tianyuan Continent shivered. Even those younger strong individuals who had just flown out showed fear.

This month, the Tianyuan Continent was dark. First, there was a great cleansing. Then, a monkey constantly challenged people to fights. In a month, it nearly overturned the entire Tianyuan Continent. From Zheng Xin down to Dong Yichen were all beaten by the monkey.

At this time, the Tianyuan Continent was terrified of monkeys. Many people kept a monkey as a pet to vent their anger.

Later, the Tianyuan Continent was handled by the monkey. The monkey naturally couldn’t sit still and continued challenging other sects in the Four Sacred Star Domains. This made the Five Elements Sect much quieter.

“Quickly…” The monkey’s voice echoed from the identity token. Zheng Xin and the others wanted the monkey to return immediately to teach Gu Lei a lesson.

“Hmph,不服 and find someone? Find him. Let him come quickly. I don’t have time to wait for him!” Gu Lei showed contempt, gazing at everyone.

“Haha, let him dance a while. Later, he’ll cry!” Seeing Gu Lei’s demeanor, they all sneered.

“Buzz…” As soon as Gu Lei finished speaking, waves echoed from the void. Then, the void tore open, and a golden figure stepped out. His aura was overwhelming, and his battle spirit surged.

“Damn it…” Gu Lei looked at the golden figure. His face instantly changed. Upon seeing the monkey, he felt it was no easy opponent and immediately felt inferior.

“Monkey Brother, it’s him! He wants to challenge you!” Diao Dezhu and the others didn’t hesitate. They pointed at Gu Lei, their eyes filled with mockery.

“Come on! The Four Sacred Star Domains have many geniuses!” The monkey showed surprise, gazing at Gu Lei and Jiang Nanxuan. He was amazed—having one or two Provisional Epoch Masters in a star domain was already good, but the Four Sacred Star Domains had three. If Zheng Xin and others had enough time, they would surely become Provisional Epoch Masters.

“Buzz…” In amazement, the monkey swung his long stick and rushed toward Gu Lei.

“We’ll go!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, not paying attention to the two fighting. He spoke to Jiang Nanxuan.

“Hmm. I have something to tell you!” Jiang Nanxuan gazed at the monkey fighting Gu Lei, his eyes flashing surprise. However, he didn’t ask further and flew toward the Tianyuan Continent with Luo Tian and others.

“Gu Lei, enjoy yourself here. Monkey Brother, don’t give us face. Hit him hard but leave him alive!” Diao Dezhu and the others shouted at Gu Lei, their voices filled with mockery.

“Damn it…” Gu Lei looked at them leaving and was stunned. He was hit by the monkey’s stick, flying backward.

“I’ll fight you!” Gu Lei flew back and shouted. He moved quickly toward the monkey, and a thunderous sound echoed throughout the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Luo Tian and others ignored the two fighting outside the Tianyuan Continent. They arrived at the Grand Hall of the Five Elements Sect.
