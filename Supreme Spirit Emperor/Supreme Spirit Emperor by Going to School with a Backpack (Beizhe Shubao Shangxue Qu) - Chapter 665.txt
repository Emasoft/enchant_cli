“Crack...” Thunder roared, a sharp collision echoed through the hall, shaking Luotian and his companions into spitting blood, nearly shattering them.

The two blood swords exploded in a burst of crimson, Tutan’s body split in half, dissolving into a sea of blood that spilled across the ground.

“Ha! You dare try to stop me? I’ve slain countless celestial kings under the Blood Demon Ancestor. What are you, anyway!” A reckless voice rang out, but all could hear its feeble breath.

“As long as the blood sea exists, I shall never perish! I am invincible!” Yet before the Blood Knife’s spirit could finish speaking, Tutan’s weakened voice echoed through the hall. The blood sea dimmed again, swirling upward to envelop the crimson longsword. In an instant, the blood sea vanished into the blade, where the Blood Knife’s spirit cried out in shock.

“How is this possible? Not even a strike could kill you!” The Blood Knife’s spirit shouted in alarm, followed by a piercing scream that echoed from within the blade.

Luotian and his companions stood pale in the hall’s corner, hearing the agonized cries and watching the red light flicker.

The crimson glow fluctuated for a full quarter-hour before gradually fading. A translucent figure emerged from the Blood Knife, its face grim.

“Success!” Luotian and his companions recognized the figure as Tutan.

“Damn it!” Tutan cursed, roaring desperately to return to the blood sea but as if grasped by an invisible hand, he could not break free.

“Damn fool!” Tutan’s form grew fainter until it vanished from Luotian’s sight.

“Who dares move? Don’t blame me when I awaken and devour you!” A cold voice echoed in their ears, making Wang Gang shudder.

“Clang…” The crimson longsword fell to the ground, snapping them back to reality. Though not as fierce as before, its blade radiated ancient divine laws.

“I guess it was a mutual destruction. That strong one might have been sealed by the Blood Knife or crippled by the spirit!”

“But one thing is certain: that sentient artifact was destroyed. This blade is now ownerless!” Momosi said, his eyes gleaming with excitement. As a swordmaster, he cherished treasures.

“How should we divide it?” They glanced at each other, suspicion in their eyes.

As for Tutan’s threat of devouring its master, they dismissed it. They were geniuses; if they feared everything, they wouldn’t have reached their current status.

“Let the blade choose its master. Whoever conquers it shall claim it!” Wang Gang said, and they all nodded. Though wary of each other, none wished to break the truce.

“Buzz…” Just as Wang Gang finished speaking, the crimson longsword emitted a buzzing sound and levitated from the ground.

“It’s trying to flee!” Their faces paled, and they launched attacks to trap the hall.

Red light flashed; in an instant, the longsword flew toward them.

“Boom…” It landed before Luotian, radiating intense energy.

“No way! I don’t believe it!” Momosi’s eyes burned with resentment as he lunged to grasp the hilt.

Blood energy surged, and the longsword violently trembled in his grip.

“Boom…” Momosi couldn’t withstand it, was flung back, staggering with disbelief.

“This….” Luotian watched Momosi retreat and reached for the hilt. At that moment, Wang Gang’s group grimaced.

“Luck is too good!” Qiu Long shouted. They weren’t fools; clearly, the blade had chosen Luotian.

“Sitting at home, wealth falls from the sky…” They sighed, envy in their eyes. They knew they couldn’t snatch it now.

“Um… I’m sorry, I don’t know why…” Luotian felt awkward, unsure why the blade chose him. Yet he sensed a strange familiarity with Tutan.

“Let’s go…” They shook their heads, disappointment in their hearts—this treasure had slipped through their fingers.

Chapter 2491: Someone Lives Here

They exited the bronze hall, the sea calmed. Standing outside, they gazed at the fading ocean. On the island, they looked to the sky; though blood energy had vanished, the stench of blood lingered.

Luotian’s back bore a blood sword; its light illuminated his face, adding an aura of blood. Without hesitation, they took off toward their path. It was smoother than before, likely due to the blood sea’s fading; the blood wolves had vanished.

Within a quarter-hour, they returned to the fissure’s upper part, gazing at the mist-shrouded crack.

“Who would’ve thought this small Blood Wolf Valley left us so battered!” Wang Gang said, still not recovered.

“Return to the Rebirth Palace.”

“The priority is to heal Mo’er!” Momosi said, watching Mo’er’s wild-eyed state.

“Even the Black and White Judges can’t help! Perhaps that person could!” Luotian mused, recalling someone who also mastered corpse control.

Yang Huanyu, once Luotian’s rival, had also fallen into Hell.

“You mean that person?” Hearing Luotian’s words, Wang Gang and the others suddenly remembered the youth who nearly destroyed them in the Wheel Pool.

Hearing Yang Huanyu’s name, Wang Gang’s group grimaced, especially Momosi’s moon-ebony eye flared with fury.

“We’ve searched for him for years, but he’s elusive. Even enlisting strong ones to predict his location failed.” Momosi said, hatred in his voice—how could he forget the eye-loss?

“Go to the depths of Blood Wolf Valley! There might be a chance to heal Mo’er!” Luotian said, gazing at the valley’s depths. He’d felt a tremor from the blade on his back.

Mo’er had followed Luotian, but though he’d lost much memory, his nature remained the same—never letting others die for him. If they returned Mo’er to the Ghost King City, the old Ghost King would surely kill him.

“Are you sure?” Wang Gang’s group looked at Luotian; if Mo’er died due to his decision, the blame would fall on him.

“Sure!” Luotian nodded and stepped into the vast fissure toward the valley’s depths.

“Good!” They didn’t object; in their view, the greatest danger had already been overcome. What else could be dangerous?

They walked through the forest, lush and vibrant, a stark contrast to before. The air brimmed with life.

“Gurgle….” Night crows called; they even felt small animals nearby.

“This feels normal, unlike before!” Wang Gang’s group didn’t sense danger, relaxing. Time passed; the forest returned to normal, the fissure vanished. They heard flowing water, serene and peaceful.

Luotian felt at ease; though the scenery wasn’t beautiful, it brought a strange calm.

“Few have entered these depths. Who’d think this would be an earthly paradise!” They marveled, pressing deeper.

“Roar…” As they relaxed, a roar echoed. A green figure appeared ahead.

A massive body, two green wings, eyes fierce and cautious as it stared at Luotian’s group.

“Wolf!” They halted instantly, recalling the blood wolves—but this one was a different species.

“Be careful; this wolf’s aura is strong, it’s already at the King level!” Momosi said, watching the green wolf.

“Capture it!” They sensed the wolf’s might and decided to subdue it; King-level beasts were rare.

In an instant, they attacked, beams of divine light striking the wolf.

“Boom…” A massive seal shattered trees, the wolf’s previous spot; others’ attacks hit but missed it, only shaking the forest.

“Fast…” Luotian’s eyes flickered and punched forward at the wolf before him.

“Hmm?” But as he threw his fist, he felt something was off—this wolf had no malice. Instead, Luotian sensed excitement and familiarity in its green eyes.

Luotian quickly retracted his punch, retreating eight-tenths of its power.

“Boom…” A dull sound rose before Luotian, making Wang Gang’s group grimace.

Luotian was knocked to the ground by the wolf’s massive body, its icy fangs approaching his face.

“What happened?” No one expected Luotian to be taken down by a wolf.

“Done!” Seeing the sharp fangs, they doubted Luotian’s neck could withstand them.

“Ugh…” But as they prepared to attack the wolf, they were stunned. The green tongue licked Luotian’s face repeatedly, drool dripping, making his mouth twitch.

“What’s going on? This guy…” They watched Luotian stand up, alongside the wolf nearly a head taller.

“Do you know me?” Luotian asked, knowing it could understand him.

“Ugh…” The green head nodded repeatedly; its eyes held no ferocity, only affection and longing.

“Unbelievable!” Wang Gang’s group shouted.

“Even that Blood Knife chose him, now this King-level green wolf comes to him—what did he do in a past life?” They raged, jealousy burning.

“Ugh…” The wolf howled, echoing through the forest. Soon, responses echoed back; a flurry of lights appeared around them. From the trees, hundreds of green wolves emerged—similar to this one. Among them were dozens with crimson fur but green eyes.

“Ugh…” Hundreds of wolves lay prostrate, as if bowing to Luotian.

“This….” Luotian was speechless; he didn’t know his connection to these wolves.

The wolf bit him playfully, even gesturing for Luotian to ride it. Luotian’s eyes flickered.

“Buzz…” Luotian waved his hand, releasing Mo’er. Since sealing him, Mo’er had remained with Luotian, as he didn’t trust others.

“Can you save this guy?” Luotian asked the wolf, who blinked in surprise. Seeing Mo’er’s green fur, its eyes turned solemn; the other wolves and crimson ones grew wary, standing up to gaze at Mo’er.

“Roar…” The wolf growled, calming its kin, then nodded to Luotian. Luotian smiled, retrieved Mo’er, and sat on the wolf’s back.

“Ugh…” The wolf howled, leaping into a green flash toward the distance.

“Howl…” Hundreds of wolves followed Luotian, running.

“This….”

“Did they leave us behind?” Wang Gang’s group cursed, taking off after the wolves.

After half an hour of running, the wolf stopped by a stream, surrounded by fences—a wooden house appeared in Luotian’s view.

“Someone lives here?” Luotian was stunned, surprised this place had inhabitants.

Before reaching the house, urgent cries echoed in his ears, shaking his spirit.

“Keep going, it’s almost out!” Encouragement rang out, making the wolf stop. Its green eyes glowed with joy.

“What’s happening?” Luotian wondered, as the wolf’s group isolated the house, radiating danger—no one could sense inside.

“Hey…” But as Luotian and the group hesitated, a baby’s cry echoed from within.

“Girl, it’s a boy!” A joyful voice rang out, making Luotian realize what was happening.

“Ugh…” The wolf howled, silencing the house’s voices.

“Little Wolf, you brought what again? You’ll end up assimilated by the Blood Wolves!” A voice scolded from within.

Two figures emerged, instantly dimming the surroundings. Luotian and his group gaped.

Chapter 2492: I Don’t Know You

“Luotian!” A woman gasped, eyes alight with excitement. Two women had contrasting vibes—one fiery and passionate, the other coldly serene.

“Su Dan!” Luotian’s group gasped, seeing the woman radiating heat and holding a baby.

They never expected to meet Su Dan here, yet she was.

A moment of silence followed; then a figure rushed forward, throwing itself into Luotian’s arms.

Su Dan stared at the woman in Luotian’s arms, eyes wide—nearly dropping the baby.

Luotian’s eyes flickered; he pushed the woman away, confusion in his gaze.

“Miss, do we know each other?” Luotian asked the woman, who turned pale.

“You…”

“What?” The woman trembled violently, staring at Luotian, stunned he’d say that.

“Roar…” The wolf’s eyes flashed anger, growling at Luotian.

“Qiu Chuan, this is the bastard you spoke of?” Su Dan’s face turned cold, holding the baby as she approached the pale woman.

“Cough….” Blood spewed from Leng Qiuchan’s mouth, her eyes fixed on Luotian in despair.

Su Dan brought the baby to Leng Qiuchan, eyes icy as she glared at Luotian.

“Su Dan, why are you here?” Wang Gang’s group asked, confused.

“I like it here; that’s why I’m here. Who is this man? Why is he with you?” Su Dan’s gaze swept over Luotian, a glint of murder.

“He… is Luotian, the Rebirth Palace’s prince!” Wang Gang’s group replied, puzzled. Normally, all of Hell knew Luotian was the Rebirth Palace prince.

“Oh? So you’re the Rebirth Palace’s prince! No wonder he looked down on my Qiuchan. How about me?” Su Dan smiled seductively, approaching Luotian with the baby.

Su Dan was naturally alluring; her aura added a unique charm, making men powerless. Her seduction now carried maturity.

This state of Su Dan left Luotian stunned, as did Wang Gang’s group.

“Buzz…” But as Luotian was lost in thought, a cold killing intent erupted—red mist spewed from Su Dan’s mouth, rushing toward Luotian.

“Still the same!” Luotian felt his spine chill; he fanned his hands, dispersing the red mist.

“Where is Luo Chen? Su Dan placed the baby in Leng Qiuchan’s arms. In her mind, the Rebirth Palace prince was Luo Chen, but now it was Luotian. Hell was cruel; to reach a position, one must tread on blood and bones.

“I didn’t expect you to appear after I left the Rebirth Palace!” Su Dan coldly said, her sword dancing.

“Buzz…” The sword roared, striking Luotian’s throat with Su Dan’s fierce killing intent.

“Crush…” Luotian raised a hand, clamping the sword.

“I am Luo Chen!” Luotian said, flicking his finger to snap Su Dan’s sword.

“What?” Leng Qiuchan and Su Dan both shook, eyes wide with disbelief.

“How is this possible!” They spoke in unison, gazing at Luotian.

“Wang Gang, is this true?” Su Dan asked Wang Gang, disbelief in her eyes.

“Indeed, he’s the original Luo Chen!” Wang Gang nodded, confused—Luotian’s relationship with these two women was clearly complex.

“Su Dan, where did this child come from?” Qiu Long asked bluntly, staring at the baby in Leng Qiuchan’s arms.

Su Dan and Leng Qiuchan exchanged glances, a bitter smile on their faces before anger replaced it.

“Luotian, I didn’t expect you to change so much after entering the Celestial Realm!” Leng Qiuchan glared at Luotian.

“Miss, who are you? I truly don’t know you! My soul was severely injured before; many memories were lost. If there’s anything I offended, please forgive me!” Luotian said helplessly.

“Liar! Luotian, this is your wife, your former wife!” Su Dan cursed, anger in her voice.

“Uh…” Luotian blinked, seeing Leng Qiuchan’s heartbroken expression. Suddenly, he remembered Fu Xingxuan had mentioned it before, but he’d dismissed it as a story.

“Lost… lost memories…” Leng Qiuchan and Su Dan whispered, their eyes reflecting bitterness.

“Do you remember me?” Su Dan asked Luotian, hope in her gaze.

“Yes, I do!” Luotian nodded, a smile on his face. His eyes shifted to the baby in Leng Qiuchan’s arms.

“This child…” Luotian asked, his blood reacting instantly, eyes widening in disbelief at Su Dan.

“You don’t have the right to interfere!” Su Dan sneered, a hint of regret in her eyes as she looked at Leng Qiuchan. She’d entered the Blood Wolf Valley months ago, met Leng Qiuchan who saved her—without her help, Su Dan wouldn’t have survived. They’d become close; Su Dan learned Leng Qiuchan’s past, and vice versa. Both knew of a person in their hearts—Luo Tian and Luo Chen.

But fate had played a cruel trick; Luo Tian and Luo Chen were one person.

Su Dan couldn’t tell Leng Qiuchan the child was connected to Luo Tian; it would hurt her too much. Su Dan knew Leng Qiuchan’s suffering when she first arrived in Hell.

“This is your son!” But Su Dan didn’t speak; Leng Qiuchan did, her voice cold yet evident pain in her pale face.

“He doesn’t recognize me but recognizes Su Dan!” Leng Qiuchan’s heart ached—Luotian forgetting her was the worst blow.

“…”

“I’m confused!” Wang Gang’s group stared at the baby, then Su Dan, then Leng Qiuchan.

“Leave us!” Su Dan told Wang Gang’s group, feeling the situation was chaotic; they needed to sort it out.

“Okay!” They nodded and took off into the forest.

“Coward! The Blood Knife, the Wolf King—everything belongs to him. There’s no justice!” They sighed, feeling all good fortune belonged to Luotian.

Su Dan seemed wild, but they knew her character—anyone who married her would gain a great ally. She’d once stood among the Eight Small Kings; she’d surely become a powerful force.

…

Inside the wooden house, Luotian felt awkward, gazing at the two stunning women. He longed to hold the baby in Su Dan’s arms.

“Miss, I truly have lost my memories. You can come with me to the Rebirth Palace. If you are indeed my wife, or if my memories return, I’ll take responsibility!” Luotian said to Leng Qiuchan.

“No need; I was mistaken. I’m not your wife!” Each word Leng Qiuchan heard felt like a hammer, shattering her heart. She was proud; Luotian remembered Su Dan and Fu Xingxuan but not her—this hurt.

“Go away, you bastard! I was blind!” Su Dan cursed, shouting at Luotian.

“This child is mine!” Luotian didn’t move, gazing at Su Dan. He’d confirmed the night was Su Dan, not Fu Xingxuan.

“I said it’s not yours! I don’t even know who this child is. Why do you say it’s yours?” Su Dan’s chest heaved, shouting at Luotian.

“It’s not possible!” Luotian was resolute; bloodline power never lied, and he knew Su Dan’s character.

“What’s not possible? Go away! We don’t want to see you!” Su Dan roared, her fiery nature blazing.

“Wail…” As Su Dan’s voice faded, the baby awoke, crying loudly with fierce eyes.

“See? My son doesn’t welcome you!” Su Dan said, voice softer now.

“Okay…” Luotian felt a knot in his chest; seeing Su Dan and Leng Qiuchan’s expressions, he knew they looked down on him now.

“Why did you come?” As Luotian stepped out of the house, Leng Qiuchan spoke, her gentle side showing.

“I came to find a cure for him!” Luotian returned to the courtyard, waved his hand, releasing Mo’er.

Mo’er’s scream echoed as he emerged, his body withered.

“Helping you is to settle our past millennia of connection!” Leng Qiuchan’s face was pale, gazing at Mo’er’s howls.

Leng Qiuchan waved her hand; a jade bottle appeared before Luotian, surprising him.

Luotian opened the bottle—blood droplets inside radiated fragrance; it was clearly not ordinary.

“Buzz…” At that moment, the blood sword on Luotian’s back broke free, radiating divine laws, and flew toward the wooden house’s mountain.

“Give it to him; he’ll recover after some rest!” Leng Qiuchan said, then returned inside.

“Gulp…” Luotian didn’t hesitate; he pried Mo’er’s mouth open and poured the blood-like liquid into it.

“Roar…” Mo’er’s painful scream echoed, white smoke rising from his body. Luotian felt the energy within him rapidly fading.

“Spit…” Mo’er coughed, expelling a blood crystal that shattered into white smoke.

“I….” As the blood crystal was expelled, Mo’er’s eyes gradually cleared, whispering. Though he regained clarity, his aura was weak—clearly severely wounded.

“Good it’s recovered. Go!” Luotian didn’t care about the missing blood sword, gazing at Su Dan: “Take care of the child. If anything happens, come to the Rebirth Palace.”

“We’d rather starve than seek you. Go!” Su Dan roared, holding the child and entering the house.

The baby’s cries echoed from within, unsettling Luotian, but he had no choice; he knew Su Dan’s stubbornness.

Amid the wolves’ hostile glares, Luotian reached the forest and found Wang Gang’s group waiting anxiously.

“I hope you all forget today!” Luotian gazed at them, making them startle.

“Master Lu, rest assured; I swear not to speak of this!” Wang Gang said, understanding Luotian’s meaning. Others also grasped it—Luotian feared Su Dan’s safety; if this spread, it might harm her.

“Buzz…” As Luotian and the group prepared to leave, the crimson longsword returned on its own, landing beside Luotian.

“Kid, you have Nine Realms’ aura!” The sword returned to Luotian’s back, a cold voice echoing in his mind.

“Tutan!” Hearing this voice, Luotian’s body trembled—unexpectedly, Tutan had awakened so quickly.

“Damn luck! Take me with you; I’ve become this blade’s soul. I just absorbed some of the Blood Flower’s essence, recovering a bit. I’ve awakened!”

“This Blood Flower is my own from the Nine Realms, an immortal herb transplanted here. You can take it; its potency exceeds ordinary immortal herbs!”

“It’s a reward, but you must find a way to restore me. I don’t want to be an artifact forever!” Tutan’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind.

Luotian had some clarity; the blood liquid Leng Qiuchan gave him must relate to Tutan’s Blood Flower.

“If I have the chance, I’ll restore you!” Luotian said but had no intention of taking the Blood Flower.

“Go!” Luotian sighed, flying toward the Blood Wolf Valley’s exit.

…

Inside the wooden house, Leng Qiuchan was stunned, her gaze vacant.

“Sister Qiuchan, he’s really gone. Don’t think about it; it’s not worth it!” Su Dan had just finished feeding the baby, comforting him to sleep. She pitied him.

“Su Dan, he remembers you—enough to show your importance in his heart. You raised the child alone; it’s hard. Plus, your father is looking for you. Go to that Rebirth Palace—it’ll protect you and the child!” Leng Qiuchan said, envy in her eyes as she watched Su Dan.

“I’ll stay with you; with our strength and the little wolf, few in Hell can harm us!” Su Dan shook her head. She couldn’t leave Leng Qiuchan here.

“No matter what, he’s a bastard!” Su Dan cursed but just then, the baby cried again.

“I’m your mother; I just scolded your father a bit, and you don’t like it? Right, he’s a bastard. What are you?” Su Dan smiled softly, comforting the baby again.

“Meeting is worse than not meeting!” Leng Qiuchan whispered, her voice laced with longing.

…

Six people ran for an hour before exiting the Blood Wolf Valley. As they left, they sighed deeply.

“Thanks, no need to say more; I’ll remember this favor!” Luotian bowed to them.

“Master Lu, no need for thanks. We’ll watch your battle with the Heaven-Devil King; we’ll cheer you on!” Wang Gang’s group smiled, bowing and parting.

They flew in different directions, obviously separating—no other matters left. This trip to the Blood Wolf Valley had only given Luotian one favor, nothing else.

Luotian sighed and didn’t leave immediately; he danced his hands around the vast Blood Wolf Valley.

He still worried about Su Dan and the child’s safety; this simple barrier was practical—anyone entering would trigger it, and he’d know.

It took a day to complete the barrier; then Luotian flew toward the Rebirth Palace.

After flying a day, he returned to the Rebirth Palace and went to Fu Xingxuan’s residence, his face tense.

“Something wrong?” Fu Xingxuan stood on the bridge, gazing at Luotian’s anxious face.

“Yes, I got the Recovery Grass!” Luotian looked at Fu Xingxuan, waving his hand to reveal clumps of Recovery Grass.

“Great! You must refine the Rebirth Pills quickly to recover your memories!” Fu Xingxuan said, excitement in her eyes.

“But… I don’t know how to refine them…” Luotian was speechless; he didn’t understand alchemy now.

“I forgot about that!” Fu Xingxuan said, frustrated. Hell had no alchemists; they’d have to find another way later.

“I came with another matter!” Luotian said, recounting his encounter with Su Dan and Leng Qiuchan in the Blood Wolf Valley.

“You met Sister Qiuchan!”

“Su Dan gave birth to a child for you!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes widened, staring at Luotian.

“Is she really your wife?” Luotian saw Fu Xingxuan’s reaction, his body trembling.

“When did you two… I didn’t know!” Fu Xingxuan’s face darkened; she’d guarded against everything but failed.

“It was that night…” Luotian said, recounting the unknown encounter with Fu Xingxuan or Su Dan.

“Get out! Don’t return until you bring Sister Qiuchan!” Fu Xingxuan shouted, kicking Luotian out of the Ghost-Devouring Pavilion.

Fu Xingxuan could imagine how Leng Qiuchan felt when Luotian spoke those words.

Luotian stood outside the pavilion, innocent and sighing deeply; he truly wanted to recover his memories.

“Go get her!” Luotian muttered, sensing Fu Xingxuan was truly angry. He took off without resting, flying toward the Blood Wolf Valley again.

“This guy!” Fu Xingxuan stepped out of the pavilion, worried Luotian might be unsafe. She took off silently behind him.

Luotian didn’t fly fast; he hadn’t rested in days, so he moved slowly—partly to recover and partly to think about how to explain.

“Say I remember? That’s too fake!” Luotian muttered, flying for an hour, regaining some mental clarity.

“Buzz…” But as Luotian pondered, waves of disturbance struck his mind.

“I activated my barrier!” His eyes narrowed—how could it be triggered so soon?
