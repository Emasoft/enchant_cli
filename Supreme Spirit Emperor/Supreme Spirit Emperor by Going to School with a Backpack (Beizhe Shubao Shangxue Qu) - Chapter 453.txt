“Let’s go. Take me to see your Blazing Fire Gang!” Luo Tian nodded.

“Young master, you have injuries. My brother and I will carry you,” Zhao Dahu said with a fawning smile, imagining himself bringing such a divine figure to the Blazing Fire Gang and finally regaining his dignity. With this mighty patron, Liu Ermazi would certainly dare not oppress them.

After finishing their words, the two swiftly cut down two trees to make a simple tool. Luo Tian sat on it as they carried him forward, one in front and the other behind.

Luo Tian did not refuse. This was an opportunity to recover his injuries. If Zhu Fenghuo refused to cooperate, he would have no choice but to act. Luo Tian had little regard for Zhu Fenghuo; from the words of the two-eyed dragon, he had already sensed that Zhu Fenghuo was no good.

“Truly a desolate place,” the three journeyed for three days, and Luo Tian’s injuries were fully recovered. During these three days, he had not seen a single soul in the forest.

“Young master, you don’t know. This forest is the outer edge of the Endless Forest. It’s remote and no one dares to come here,” Zhao Dahu said softly.

After three days, Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu felt Luo Tian’s aura growing stronger.

After walking for three days, the two finally led Luo Tian out of the forest and onto a small path.

As they walked, more people appeared. When the passersby saw Zhao Dahu and the stammering giant’s fearsome looks, they stepped aside. What puzzled them was that these two fierce figures were carrying an ordinary young man.

Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu ignored the onlookers’ gazes, leading Luo Tian for a day until they reached the Blazing Fire Gang’s mountain stronghold.

“Young master, we’ve arrived. This is our Blazing Fire Gang!” The one-eyed dragon said with reverence.

“Ah…”

“Is that you, One-Eye? It’s been months since I last saw you two. You’ve made a catch, bringing back a hostage?” As they arrived at the mountain gate, mocking voices echoed in their ears.

The voice faded as a middle-aged man stepped out of the gate. Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes and sighed, “How can a person look so ugly!”

The man’s two small eyes seemed half-closed. If one didn’t look closely, it was hard to tell he had eyes at all. Two small black mustaches framed his face, and the most striking feature was the countless freckles covering it. One could doubt whether he had a face or if the freckles were his face.

“Liu Ermazi!” Zhao Dahu saw the man and clenched his teeth, eyes filled with hatred.

“Haha! One-Eye Zhao Dahu, this is the hostage you brought back? You two really are good at it. Bringing a hostage back!” Before Liu Ermazi could speak, his henchmen sneered and approached Zhao Dahu.

“You two step aside. We need to see the leader. This young master is not a hostage but someone we’ve brought in for the gang!” The one-eyed dragon felt some courage upon thinking of Luo Tian and shouted at Liu Ermazi.

“The leader has no time for you. He’s currently enjoying himself. I just captured Long Youlan, the city lord of Dragon Singing City. Do you think he’ll have time for you?”

“Dare to shout at me? You’ve lost your other eye. This kid’s delicate skin—joining the gang? I think he’d fit better in my place!” Liu Ermazi stroked his mustache, smiling at Luo Tian.

“Death…” A cold voice echoed in everyone’s ears, causing their bodies to tremble. Even Liu Ermazi, a half-step Heaven Dao Realm master, was shaken.

“Peng…” As they trembled, a golden hand suddenly descended from the sky and struck Liu Ermazi. He was instantly turned into blood mist.

Dust and blood mist swirled, splattering on people’s bodies. No one cared about their stained clothes; they stared in terror at Luo Tian rising from the dust. None expected this frail youth to be a world-renowned killer, slaying Liu Ermazi with one strike.

Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu wore expressions of disbelief. Though they knew Luo Tian was strong, seeing him kill Liu Ermazi made their hearts shudder. They could not fathom how this quiet youth had suddenly become so different.

“Disgusting creature!” Luo Tian spoke coldly. Liu Ermazi’s gaze had stirred a chill in his heart. Though it had been years, he clearly remembered the look of those two Li family guards who had stared at him. It was exactly like Liu Ermazi’s gaze. That was when Luo Tian had leaped into the Forgotten Abyss and obtained the Epoch Scripture.

Luo Tian still felt fear. If he had fallen into that fat man’s hands, what would have become of him?

Liu Ermazi held a high position in the Blazing Fire Gang. People knew of Liu Fenghuo’s habits—his lust for both men and women, with many victims under his hand.

“Who are you?” Soon after, the Blazing Fire Gang members emerged from the mountain stronghold. Killing in their own gate was unprecedented for this youth.

“You two are under my protection. I am your leader!”

“And from now on, some of you will also be under my care,” Luo Tian smiled at the Blazing Fire Gang members.

“Finished…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the one-eyed dragon and stammering giant nearly collapsed. They had intended to find a helper for the Blazing Fire Gang, but who would have thought this master would kill Liu Ermazi with one strike and imply taking over the gang? They had expected a great achievement, but instead found a blade that would take their lives.

“Haha! You’re boasting too much. Do you know who our leader is? Zhu Fenghuo. Even the city lords nearby dare not move against him. What are you, a little kid?” One mocked.

“Exactly! Our leader will come out soon. You’ll be dead!” Upon hearing Zhu Fenghuo’s name, the other Blazing Fire Gang members displayed confidence.

Chapter 1761: Zhu Fenghuo

“Just wait, our leader will come out soon. You killed Liu Ermazi. When he arrives, you’ll wish you were dead!” A youth with scars on his body shouted at Luo Tian.

“Who is he?” Luo Tian smiled and turned to Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu, who were stunned.

“He… he… he…” Zhao Erniu stammered, sweat pouring down his face. His mind was filled with visions of Zhu Fenghuo’s fury. Zhao Erniu, who stammered when nervous, could not speak.

“He is Lu Chunchun, one of Zhu Fenghuo’s trusted men. He has committed many heinous crimes before. The most cruel was killing all seventy-two members of a rich family and peeling their skin. We call him Lu the Scalper,” Zhao Dahu gritted his teeth and recounted Lu Chunchun’s history, eyes wild.

Zhao Dahu knew the seemingly harmless youth was no ordinary person. Compared to Zhao Erniu, Zhao Dahu understood that Luo Tian’s actions had bound them both with him.

“Puu…” As Zhao Dahu finished speaking, Lu Chunchun was instantly turned into blood mist like Liu Ermazi.

“Wow…” Everyone trembled, eyes filled with fear. These robbers had lived on the edge of death for years but were still stunned by Luo Tian’s ruthless execution.

“Anyone else?” Luo Tian smiled, scanning the crowd with a death god’s gaze.

“Y-yes…” Zhao Dahu looked around as Luo Tian spoke. At this moment, Zhao Dahu saw the fearful glances of those who had once oppressed them.

For years, Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu had suffered under Liu Ermazi’s oppression. They had endured mockery and even taken losses from some people.

Seeing Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu’s gaze, those who had followed Liu Ermazi to oppress them all trembled and retreated into the crowd.

“That Ding Minhong, back then…” Zhao Erniu seemed to have given up, pointing at a man in the crowd and recounting his past.

“Rumors…” Upon hearing Zhao Erniu’s words, the robbers around Ding Minhong scattered, leaving him exposed.

“I…” Ding Minhong barely started to speak when a golden hand hovered above his head, pressing him with unbearable pressure. His eyes filled with terror.

“Wu…” The hand slowly descended, filling Ding Minhong’s eyes with despair. He had no will to resist.

“Who are you?” As the golden hand was about to kill Ding Minhong, a cold voice echoed from the mountain peak. Simultaneously, a red hand swept over.

“Peng…” In an instant, the two hands collided above Ding Minhong’s head, causing a thunderous sound in everyone’s ears.

Ding Minhong spat blood and collapsed to the ground, his body cracking from the collision’s shockwave.

As the voice faded, a young man in a blood robe descended from the mountain peak. His eyes scanned the two crimson stains on the ground, filled with fury.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian raised his hands and looked at the young man, then felt a slight relief.

This youth seemed powerful but was also Heaven Dao Realm. However, Luo Tian sensed little threat from him. He felt less danger than the crises posed by Hou Heye and Yu Changtian on the Immortal Road. This one was clearly unstable.

“Indeed, Heaven Dao Realm in the Immortal World is much weaker than that of the Three Thousand Small Worlds!” Luo Tian muttered.

“Haha, young brother, I think we have a misunderstanding. The Blazing Fire Sect has never offended you, Luo brother. If you don’t mind, I can offer you the position of second-in-command. Except for me, anyone in the Blazing Fire Sect can be commanded by you, and their lives are under your control,” Zhu Fenghuo met Luo Tian’s gaze and felt a slight sinking. Though Luo Tian was also Heaven Dao Realm, Zhu Fenghuo sensed a strong threat from him.

Especially after that one glance and the clash of their hands, Zhu Fenghuo felt he faced a monstrous beast ready to tear him apart. This feeling was one Zhu Fenghuo had only felt from some overpowered Heaven Dao Realm masters.

“Just now, I captured Long Youlan, the daughter of Dragon Singing City’s lord. I hadn’t had time to enjoy her yet, but now I’ll give her to you, Luo brother. Let’s be friends!” Zhu Fenghuo smiled at Luo Tian.

Zhu Fenghuo did not want to clash with Luo Tian and offered his conditions, a form of compromise.

Upon hearing Zhu Fenghuo’s words, the Blazing Fire Sect members wore expressions of disbelief. They had never expected their fierce leader Zhu Fenghuo to negotiate with this man who had just killed two important figures of the Blazing Fire Sect.

Zhu Fenghuo’s name was known throughout the nearby cities. Even city lords had never dared to look down on him. Yet this youth made Zhu Fenghuo treat him so, even giving him the recently captured Long Youlan. This was something Zhu Fenghuo had never done before.

Yet Luo Tian stood expressionless, gazing at Zhu Fenghuo as if thinking.

“Luo brother, don’t underestimate this Long Youlan. Her looks need no explanation; what I Zhu Fenghuo value is never inferior. Many have coveted her!”

“Her strength is also remarkable. She’s under thirty and already a half-step Heaven Dao Realm, with great power. If I hadn’t planned carefully and coincidentally caught her on the way to the Immortal Gate’s disciple exam, I wouldn’t have captured her. The Long family’s Long Li is also a ruthless man; I’ve had to be cautious around him!” Seeing Luo Tian’s expression, Zhu Fenghuo spoke again.

“Hmph. Finished?” Luo Tian nodded and stretched his shoulders, speaking to Zhu Fenghuo.

“Finished. What’s wrong, brother? You’re not satisfied?” Seeing Luo Tian’s indifferent expression, Zhu Fenghuo’s face darkened.

“Not satisfied. Just because you’re a trash, do you think you can sit on my head and defecate?” Luo Tian vanished like a ghost.

“You…” Zhu Fenghuo’s face turned angry. He had already conceded and given in, but this youth still wanted to fight him.

Even the most patient person has their limits. Zhu Fenghuo was a renowned figure in this area, and he had already given Luo Tian enough face.

“Wu…” But as Zhu Fenghuo prepared to retaliate, a sound of trembling void echoed in his ears, making him shocked.

A fist that swallowed the sky struck Zhu Fenghuo’s face, sending his body flying like a broken kite.

“Peng…” The crowd gasped. All the Blazing Fire Sect robbers stared in disbelief at Zhu Fenghuo’s body crashing into the mountain gate. They had never expected their powerful leader to be sent flying by this strong youth without a chance to resist.

“Cough… cough…” Zhu Fenghuo rose painfully, blood spitting from his mouth. He felt dazed.

“You…” Zhu Fenghuo was furious and wanted to speak again, but another golden fist met his face.

“Crack…” This time was even more惨烈. People could clearly hear Zhu Fenghuo’s skull cracking and his twisted face.

“My mom, did we find a monster?” Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu shouted as they again sent Zhu Fenghuo flying, rushing toward him.

“You’re seeking death!” Zhu Fenghuo, though wounded, was still a Heaven Dao Realm master. He remained clear-minded but trembled inside. After years of commanding bloodshed, he had no choice but to accept this.

“Wu…” Zhu Fenghuo spoke, his aura rising like a storm. A terrifying killing intent emerged from him, solidifying into an actual force that pressed toward Luo Tian, freezing the air with its coldness.

“This is the killing intent accumulated by our leader over years. Those under it will be affected!” Seeing Zhu Fenghuo finally retaliate, the Blazing Fire Sect robbers felt a surge of energy. None of them were innocent; they had all witnessed Luo Tian’s methods. If Luo Tian killed Zhu Fenghuo, their fates would not be better.

As for resisting, they had never considered it. This变态 could kill two half-step Heaven Dao Realm masters with one hand, so they had to rely on Zhu Fenghuo.

But the next moment, people were disappointed. The变态 youth showed no effect at all. His aura surged toward Zhu Fenghuo and delivered another punch.

“Crack…” The sound of cracking echoed again. Zhu Fenghuo’s body flew out ten feet, collapsing onto the ground with a cloud of dust.

“Finished…” The people around looked at Luo Tian like a monster. They knew Zhu Fenghuo was finished, and this youth had made the powerful Zhu Fenghuo look like a child.

“Blazing Fire Heaven!” As people felt desperate, a mad voice rose from the dust.

Chapter 1762: Rename

The mad voice rose from the dust, making Luo Tian smile slightly. He paused briefly but then rushed toward Zhu Fenghuo again.

“Peng…” A crimson flame surged into the sky. The dust vanished instantly, fire waves rolling with intense heat that distorted people’s vision, blocking their view of Zhu Fenghuo behind the flames.

“Huh…” Zhu Fenghuo exhaled, wind swirling. Next moment, fire caught the wind and surged again, crimson flames sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Is this变态 looking for death!” People saw Luo Tian rushing into the flames, their faces filled with disbelief.

“That’s Blazing Fire Heaven, our leader’s signature technique. Though it's a high-level Dao Realm skill, it rivals an Immortal Realm beginner’s technique and can threaten even Immortal Realm masters!” People whispered, watching Luo Tian rush into the crimson flames.

As they marveled, Luo Tian’s figure vanished into the crimson fire and disappeared from view.

“Stupid!” Zhu Fenghuo’s twisted face showed relief. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so foolish as to rush into his technique. He knew the origin of this skill well.

“Peng…” But Zhu Fenghuo’s heart clenched. His eyes widened, staring at the youth who had approached him, filled with shock.

The crimson fire exploded, and a figure surrounded by seven-colored flames emerged from the fire. The scattered flames seemed to be drawn by some strange force, rushing toward the figure and vanishing into its swirling seven-colored flames without a ripple.

“Peng…” Another punch with no flair struck Zhu Fenghuo’s face. His body flew out again without surprise. This time, Zhu Fenghuo never rose again. His eyes were closed, blood spitting from his mouth, and his head seemed ready to shatter at any moment.

“This time, it’s truly over. Even Blazing Fire Heaven couldn’t defeat this killer!” People watched Luo Tian, now wrapped in seven-colored flames like a king of fire, walking toward Zhu Fenghuo.

“Not bad at enduring blows!” Luo Tian smiled, the seven-colored flames slowly entering his body, revealing his handsome face.

“From now on, this Blazing Fire Sect will be renamed Tianyuan Sect!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, stepping toward Zhu Fenghuo’s fallen body and raising his foot to stomp on his head.

“Sometimes the Immortal World is convenient. Killing people doesn’t require worrying about blood rebirth; dead is dead!” Luo Tian sighed softly, his foot slowly descending.

“Wu…” Just as Luo Tian’s foot was about to land on Zhu Fenghuo’s head, Zhu Fenghuo suddenly opened his eyes, filled with desperate and wild fury.

“I die, you’ll join me in death!” Zhu Fenghuo roared, spitting out a red flame from his mouth.

The red flame looked like blood on fire, appearing strangely beautiful. At the moment of spitting it out, Zhu Fenghuo seemed drained, his aura dropping sharply.

“Big brother, avenge me!” Zhu Fenghuo shouted at the red flame before collapsing to the ground.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s foot crashed down on Zhu Fenghuo’s head, splattering blood.

“Come here!” But Luo Tian showed no joy. He extended his hand to grab the red flame.

“Peng…” Luo Tian’s speed was still too slow. The red flame dispersed just as he reached it, turning into a blood mist that scattered before him.

“Damn!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. Though he didn’t know what Zhu Fenghuo’s method was, he knew it wasn’t simple. It must be at least a Celestial Immortal.

Tianlong Mountain, one of the three major powers in the Lower Three Heavens, Tianmen Sect’s mountain gate. In a grand hall on the vast peak, as the red flame shattered, a young man in blue robes slowly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with coldness.

“Blood Slaughter!” The young man spoke softly, voice devoid of emotion. As he spoke, a red light appeared behind him. A blood mist obscured his face as it bowed slightly.

“Blazing Fire was killed. I need to go execute the mission of finding those who ascended recently for the Sect. I can’t spare time, so you go investigate and bring the killer of Blazing Fire to me. Make sure he’s alive!” The young man spoke softly, voice devoid of emotion.

“Yes!” The blood figure bowed slightly. Beneath the red mist, a crimson tongue licked his lips before vanishing into the hall.

“Although my incompetent younger brother is ungrateful, no one can kill him so easily!” The young man closed his eyes again, cold words echoing in the hall.

“First, clarify the situation. If it’s not good, then flee!” Luo Tian muttered softly, then smiled again like a death god, scanning the people who were still stunned.

“Alright, let’s continue what we left off!” Luo Tian addressed Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu.

“Yes, leader!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu perked up. Their eyes scanned the remaining people.

“L-L-Leader… he… he… he…” Zhao Erniu stammered, pointing at a middle-aged man but unable to speak due to nervousness.

“Let me. His name is Zhang Tongguang. Previously…” Zhao Dahu quickly stopped his stammering brother and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Peng… Peng…” Golden hands kept falling, almost immediately turning the person Zhao Dahu pointed at into blood mist.

Cries echoed constantly. Each robber who touched Luo Tian’s底线 fell under his hand.

“You won’t have a good end. Our leader’s older brother has already known our leader is dead. He won’t let you off. He’s a disciple of the Immortal Gate. He’ll come soon!” A middle-aged man shouted before dying.

“Leader… there is no more…” Zhao Dahu spoke to Luo Tian. At first, Zhao Dahu felt good, but later he was scared. In less than an hour, over two hundred people in the mountain stronghold were dead. Zhao Dahu remembered that even when the nearby Dragon Singing City had come to suppress them, they hadn’t lost so many.

At the mountain gate of the Blazing Fire Sect, it looked like it had been washed in blood. The crimson scene made even the ruthless robbers tremble. They were killers without mercy, but this变态 killed like drinking water, never blinking.

“Alright, the rest of you have a choice. Submit or die!” Luo Tian addressed the crowd. Killing those who deserved it was one reason, but also to intimidate these people. Though he had killed Zhu Fenghuo, Luo Tian knew they were defiant and needed blood to intimidate.

“Hail the Sect Master!” Everyone, facing Luo Tian’s might, dared not resist. They all bowed to him, though their hearts feared Zhu Fenghuo’s brother’s retaliation. But this master was now the knife at their necks, ready to fall at any moment.

“Let’s go. Enter and replace the sign!” Luo Tian grabbed the mountain gate of the Blazing Fire Sect, smashing it apart. Then he stepped into the stronghold.

Guided by Zhao Dahu, Luo Tian quickly reached a grand hall—the treasure division of the Blazing Fire Sect.

“Speak up. Who knows about Zhu Fenghuo’s brother?” As Luo Tian sat down, he addressed the heads who had followed him in.

“Leader, the previous… no, Zhu Fenghuo did have a brother. His name is Zhu Fengtian. He’s definitely a disciple of the Immortal Gate. As for his position in the Immortal Gate, we don’t know. Every year, we bring plundered resources to send to Zhu Fengtian!” A middle-aged man stepped forward from the crowd, his face respectful.

“We heard that Zhu Fenghuo was also a disciple of the Immortal Gate. However, he was expelled for breaking rules and lacking talent!”

“If it weren’t for this connection, the nearby city lords might have already united to destroy us!” The middle-aged man explained softly for Luo Tian.

“Immortal Gate!” Luo Tian frowned slightly, sighing inwardly. He hadn’t expected to offend a disciple of the Immortal Gate so soon after arriving in the Immortal World. Though he was strong in Heaven Dao Realm, he wasn’t sure about Celestial Immortals’ power.

“How long does it take to reach the Immortal Gate?” Luo Tian asked again, wanting to know how much time he had. If it was short, he would flee immediately.

“About three months. Celestial Immortals are faster—two months!” The middle-aged man was confused, not knowing why Luo Tian didn’t know this.

“Two months? Try to break through to a Celestial Immortal. If the one coming is a Celestial Immortal, I can handle it. If not, I’ll have to find a way to escape!” Luo Tian muttered, quickly organizing his plan.

Chapter 1763: Long Youlan

“Alright, go about your business. Don’t do any deals for two days. Once we’ve set new rules, you can go out!” Luo Tian sighed and addressed Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu.

“Yes!” Everyone bowed respectfully, though they might have thought otherwise. They exited the treasure division with respect.

“Dahu, take me to your treasure vault!” Luo Tian watched them leave and addressed Zhao Dahu, who was also leaving. He wanted to understand the entire Blazing Fire Sect and learn about the Lower Three Heavens.

“Yes, leader!” Zhao Dahu quickly stopped and bowed respectfully, leading this new leader toward the treasure vault.

After Luo Tian had killed Zhu Fenghuo and his two hundred loyalists, the stronghold was quieter. Others stayed in their quarters, not daring to move freely.

Luo Tian and Zhao Dahu reached the imposing treasure vault’s door, where waves of energy radiated outward.

“Leader, we’ve arrived. But this outer gate has a formation; only Zhu Fenghuo can open it!” Zhao Dahu said respectfully, not entering.

“Crack…” Before Zhao Dahu finished speaking, a golden light shot from Luo Tian’s hand. The sharp energy made Zhao Dahu shiver. He saw the formation break before his eyes.

“Leader is truly fierce!” Zhao Dahu’s respect deepened. He hadn’t even seen how Luo Tian had acted.

“Alright, let’s go in!” Luo Tian spoke softly and pushed open the door to enter the treasure vault.

A spacious hall with weapons on shelves, jade bottles, and some jade scrolls. Waves of power swept through the hall.

“Truly impressive!” Luo Tian sighed, grabbing a long sword from the shelf. He shook his head; this sword was sharp enough to be remarkable in the Nine Domains, but he knew such weapons were nothing in the Immortal World.

“Pick two for you and Erniu,” Luo Tian told Zhao Dahu. He valued the jade bottles in the corner more than these weapons. These bottles, he guessed, contained some elixirs.

“Thank you, leader!” Zhao Dahu’s face lit up with excitement. Though Luo Tian didn’t value these items, he did. These treasures were forged by Heaven Dao Realm masters. Though they lacked the imprints of Heaven Dao masters, their power was much stronger than ordinary weapons.

Luo Tian walked to the jade bottles and picked one up, opening it. His face showed confusion.

“Wu…” Waves of energy echoed from the bottle, filling Luo Tian with a slight smile but also confusion.

“Three-Transcendence Gathering Immortal Elixir!” Luo Tian picked up a jade scroll beside the bottle, reading its description and method.

“Immortal Rank One Elixir!” After reading the description, Luo Tian felt more confusion. Though this elixir was powerful, it was much weaker than the one he had taken from the Burial Coffin.

“That elixir in the Burial Coffin was my master’s. My master was a prodigy of the Nine Immortal Mountains. The elixirs must have been excellent!” Luo Tian muttered softly, then realized.

“Peng…” The sound of an explosion echoed in Luo Tian’s hand. The bottle and its elixir shattered with a burst of power, spreading outward.

“Cough… cough…” Dust swirled. Zhao Dahu had just picked up a large knife and his body wobbled, looking at Luo Tian. Seeing the shattered bottle under Luo Tian’s feet, Zhao Dahu’s face showed regret.

“Wu…” Three energies hovered above Luo Tian’s hand. He recognized these energies immediately—Immortal Qi.

“Three Immortal Qis!” Luo Tian felt a realization. This elixir’s Immortal Qi was leagues behind the one he had taken from the Burial Coffin.

“Leader, you’re wasting it!” Zhao Dahu held his tiger-headed knife and approached Luo Tian, looking at the three Immortal Qis dissipating.

“Just one Immortal Rank One Elixir!” Luo Tian shook his head. To him, this elixir was common in the Immortal World.

“Leader, this elixir was meant for Zhu Fenghuo to send to his older brother in the Immortal Gate. You should know how precious it is, right?” Zhao Dahu looked puzzled. This leader was strong but sometimes acted like a fool.

“Oh? Explain how precious it is!” Luo Tian spoke softly, looking at Zhao Dahu.

“Because elixir masters are rare. In the Immortal World, Heaven Dao Realm masters live a thousand years. Alchemy is time-consuming; who would waste time on it instead of cultivation?” Zhao Dahu spoke, his eyes filled with admiration.

“Indeed!” Upon hearing Zhao Dahu’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He understood the difference between the Nine Domains and the Immortal World. In the Nine Domains, many chose to become elixir masters, but in the Immortal World, alchemists were rarer.

“Alright, let’s go!” Luo Tian smiled slightly. Alchemy was never something he gave up. If he couldn’t make immortal elixirs in the Nine Domains, he would try in the Immortal World.

Luo Tian waved his hand, collecting the jade bottles and scrolls on the shelves. He addressed Zhao Dahu, who had chosen his weapon, and they exited the treasure vault.

“L-L-Leader… you two are out!” As Luo Tian and Zhao Dahu exited, Zhao Erniu’s stammering voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Erniu, what’s wrong?” Zhao Dahu knew Zhao Erniu’s issue and looked puzzled.

“L-L-Leader… that, that Long Youlan is almost causing a riot. Go check it out!” Zhao Erniu stammered.

“Long Youlan?” Luo Tian frowned. He had instructed them to release her before entering the treasure vault, and everyone who should be released was.

“What’s going on? Tell me slowly!” Luo Tian addressed Zhao Erniu, holding a silver needle and preparing to prick his neck.

“Ah…” A scream echoed. The needle pierced Zhao Erniu’s neck, making his face twist. His already fierce face became even more terrifying, sweat pouring down.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian felt awkward and pulled the misaligned needle out. He had intended to cure Zhao Erniu’s stammering, after all, he was a “Master Healer!”

“Leader… you… you pricked me… why?” Zhao Erniu looked puzzled.

“No problem. Speak, speak!” Luo Tian coughed softly, mentally sighing. His needle technique still needed more practice.

“I just went to release that Long Youlan and others. Everyone else was released, but this Long Youlan didn’t leave. Instead, she caused a commotion!”
