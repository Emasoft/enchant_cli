„How can a physical body fight against stone!“ Luo Tian's lips curled, his hands formed seals. The Formation of Heaven and Earth unfolded, transforming into a thousand-zhang figure that stood tall between heaven and earth.

„Roar...“ Though Luo Tian's body had grown massive, the dragon demon still showed no fear. It roared again and charged toward Luo Tian.

„Return to me!“ Luo Tian launched his attack. Five shadowy fists merged, combined with the Wind of Chaos, striking the dragon fiercely.

Luo Tian's body recoiled again but no longer with the same desperation. His eyes flashed with shock.

„Crash...“ The dragon's body shed large fragments, its massive form flying backward. The demon's strength was formidable; Luo Tian's power was equally strong. Their flesh bodies, both unparalleled in might, clashed repeatedly within the stone forest.

„Boom...“ The thunderous sound never ceased. Luo Tian's fists collided with the dragon's body, sending shards flying and blood spewing.

Time passed slowly. After half an hour, Luo Tian's powerful flesh was riddled with cracks, his breath steaming. He gazed at the dragon, whose body was also covered in fissures, appearing on the verge of shattering.

„I won't believe I can't kill you!“ Luo Tian sneered, the sixth step of the Ferocious Seven Steps thundering forward as he pressed down on the dragon.

The earth trembled. A formidable aura caused the dragon to emit a series of roars, fear flickering in its eyes as it fled toward the distance.

„It's too late to run now!“ Luo Tian formed seals, a grey domain enveloping the dragon instantly. The overwhelming aura caused the dragon to hesitate momentarily.

„Crash...“ In an instant, a black foot descended, crushing the dragon's body. The dark dragon shattered, scattering across the ground as piles of demonic stones. Black demonic energy rose into the air.

Luo Tian opened his mouth, absorbing the demonic energy radiating from the stones. He refined it into himself. Without its demonic energy, the Eight Treasures Jade Immortal Stones emitted divine laws, piled there. Luo Tian extended his hand, and a black demon crystal appeared in his palm—the Dragon Eye Huan Mo Stone.

„Boom...“ At the moment Luo Tian obtained the Huan Mo Stone, his mind throbbed violently.

„The Half-Volume of the Heart Demon Classic!“ Luo Tian exclaimed. He had thought it was Guan Hongsheng's Huan Mo Stone, but it turned out to be the Half-Volume of the Heart Demon Classic.

Chapter 2400: Departure

As Luo Tian lifted the Huan Mo Stone, the seemingly boundless stone forest seemed to lose its support. It began to collapse continuously, turning into yellow sand that fell onto the ground. The entire stone forest vanished.

Luo Tian sat down without hesitation, beginning to cultivate the Half-Volume of the Heart Demon Classic. His body radiated waves. The sound of thunder rose from his dantian, a powerful suction emanating from him. The Eight Treasures Jade Immortal Stones still retaining some demonic energy trembled instantly, emitting wisps of demonic energy from the mountainous pile.

„Buzz...“ The demonic energy rushed toward Luo Tian, disappearing in an instant.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, a sense of admiration in them. In that moment, the speed of refining demonic energy was more than twice as fast as before.

„This is an astonishing technique!“ Luo Tian muttered, confirming that the Heart Demon Classic was undoubtedly one of the most outstanding attack methods in the Immortal Realm.

„Where is that Huan Mo Stone Guan Hongsheng had?“

„The Heart Demon Elder truly knows how to hide! He even hid it in the Death Desert!“ Luo Tian muttered internally. At the same time, he waved his hand to seal the Huan Mo Stone. After all, this was no laughing matter. Luo Tian didn't know what would happen if he combined this Huan Mo Stone with the one he had. He didn't want to take chances.

A short while later, Luo Tian sealed the Huan Mo Stone. He gazed at the shattered Eight Treasures Jade Immortal Stones, sighing inwardly in regret.

The dragon had been over a hundred zhang long. Now it was shattered by Luo Tian, its fragments large enough for one person to sit on. But clearly, they weren't as effective when scattered.

„Master, let me handle this crude work!“ Bu Tian Shi's sycophantic voice rang out. Luo Tian ignored him, collecting the mountainous pile of Eight Treasures Jade Immortal Stones.

„You bastard! Get lost. If you dare absorb even one, I'll throw you into the latrine. I haven't finished with you yet for that incident. How dare you act so arrogantly!“ Hearing Bu Tian Shi's words, Luo Tian cursed loudly and transmitted a mental message to Fire Master Meng Wushuang.

Meng Wushuang, apparently facing an equal opponent, had both sides sustaining injuries but neither had given their all.

„Who is this person? Though Mount Xumi doesn't emerge, we have records of the Nine Immortal Mountains. Why haven't we encountered this person before!“ Bai Ye mused, his combat revealing some minor setbacks.

„Haha, old monk, I won't play with you anymore. I'm leaving!“ Meng Wushuang received Luo Tian's mental message, sensing the stone forest collapsing around him. He laughed and struck a palm against Bai Ye, using the momentum to retreat toward Luo Tian's direction.

„Bu Tian Shi, where is that demon shell? Have you subdued it? Tell me, how many things have you stolen over the years!“ Luo Tian asked Bu Tian Shi while waiting for Fire Master.

„I'm innocent, master. I've been diligent these years, finally subduing that demon shell and weakening its strength, turning it into a super puppet!“ Bu Tian Shi quickly explained upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

„A super puppet?“ Luo Tian's face showed interest. He had suffered greatly from that demon shell before. If it hadn't been for the artifact spirit of Zhao Tian Tower saving him, he and Fire Master might have perished in Zhao Tian Tower.

„Master, I handle things. You can rest assured!“ As he spoke, Zhao Tian Tower radiated red light. A black figure appeared before Luo Tian, its withered body appearing fragile but containing a terrifying aura within.

„Hmm?“ Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly. This demon shell was clearly weaker than before. He extended a fist toward it.

„Crash...“ The withered body recoiled, leaving a punch mark on the demon shell.

„A flesh body comparable to an Immortal King's mid-phase?“ Luo Tian's eyes showed dissatisfaction. That demon shell had nearly crushed him with a single slap before.

„Too weak!“ Luo Tian muttered, his gaze turning to Bu Tian Shi on Zhao Tian Tower.

„Master, this is the result of the artifact spirit's subjugation. If it hadn't subdued it and greatly weakened its strength, do you think you'd be alive today?“ Bu Tian Shi spoke.

A super puppet of an Immortal King's mid-phase—who wouldn't want it? Yet this one was complaining about its weakness. It left Bu Tian Shi speechless.

„Well, it's still a formidable technique!“ Luo Tian chuckled lightly and collected the puppet.

„Rumbling...“ As Luo Tian just collected the puppet, a series of thunderous sounds approached. Two figures clashed while approaching Luo Tian, causing his brows to furrow slightly.

„Master, I asked you to come here, not to bring this person!“ Luo Tian addressed Meng Wushuang who was still clashing with Bai Ye.

„That old man ran fast, like a patch of dog skin!“ Meng Wushuang clashed with Bai Ye and took two steps back, then spoke to Luo Tian.

„Youth, hand over Zhao Tian Tower and the Eight Treasures Jade Immortal Stones immediately, or I won't be polite!“ Bai Ye roared upon seeing Luo Tian, his madness intensifying.

„That's impossible... Old man, if you persist in chasing us, don't blame me for capturing you! After all, it's not the first time I've captured monks!“ Luo Tian roared and leapt into the air, his fists merging to strike Bai Ye fiercely.

„Good! I'll capture you. A mere Immortal King's early phase dares to provoke me!“ Bai Ye laughed, his golden Buddha palm striking.

„Crash...“ In an instant, the fist and palm collided. Two opposing forces—black and white—constantly clashed.

„A formidable flesh body!“ Bai Ye marveled, watching Luo Tian recoil as well.

„And I have this... Since you won't leave, I'll have to keep you!“ As Bai Ye was astonished, Fire Master's attack also arrived. Together with Luo Tian, they surrounded Bai Ye and struck him until he spat blood.

Bai Ye roared. His hands formed a bell-shaped seal, enclosing himself and resisting Fire Master's hand.

„Boom...“ The deafening sound of the bell rang out. Fire Master's face changed, a powerful rebound force causing his lips to bleed.

„Golden Bell Armor. One of Mount Xumi's secret techniques, unassailable by all methods. How do you counter it!“ Bai Ye sneered and formed seals, golden light descending from the sky to strike Luo Tian.

„I won't believe it!“ Fire Master showed no concern for Luo Tian's safety. He rose again, his purple fire surging and burning the eight directions toward Bai Ye's bell-shaped seal.

„It won't work!“ Bai Ye's eyes showed confidence, watching the terrifying fire approach. He formed seals again, golden light descending to strike Luo Tian.

„Buzz...“ Longyuan's hum collided with the golden light, blocking Bai Ye's attack.

„Crash...“ At the same time, terrifying fire approached Bai Ye and instantly engulfed him. The sea of fire continuously churned.

„It's no good?“

„He compressed the domain through secret methods!“ Meng Wushuang spoke, his voice filled with admiration. He marveled at the profound heritage of the Nine Immortal Mountains, even possessing such mastery over domains.

„Haha, come on!“ Bai Ye stood within the golden bell, laughing wildly. He watched Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang.

„Master, let me kill this bald monk!“ Bu Tian Shi's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind. This was the first time Luo Tian had heard Bu Tian Shi say such words. Bu Tian Shi's bravery surprised him, his eagerness to destroy Bai Ye made Luo Tian curious—what had Bai Ye done to Bu Tian Shi to make it so hostile?

„Let's not. We don't need it yet!“ Luo Tian chuckled lightly, watching the fire gradually fade. He exchanged a glance with Meng Wushuang and nodded.

„Haha, come on!“ Bai Ye roared. His voice carried contempt as he shouted at Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang.

„Go...“ Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang ignored Bai Ye's cries, immediately leaping into the air and flying away.

„Idiot. We can see you can't move!“ Their speed surged, instantly vanishing from Bai Ye's sight. Luo Tian's voice still echoed in the heavens.

„You...“ Bai Ye was speechless, stunned that Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang had chosen to flee. His Golden Bell Armor prevented movement; if he moved, it would collapse. Thus, Bai Ye intended to let them exhaust themselves. But he didn't know who Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang were—two warriors with more battles than the meals Bai Ye had eaten. Their sharp eyes quickly discerned the weakness of Bai Ye's technique.

In a moment, Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang vanished. Bai Ye's face darkened.

„You bastard! Even if you run to hell, I'll find you!“ Bai Ye roared and began searching for Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang in the Death Desert.

Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang flew over the Death Desert, a condition offering them great space to escape. Even Bai Ye would find it impossible to track their presence.

„Master, you've changed. Why are you so merciful?“ Bu Tian Shi's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, disbelief evident.

„Let's avoid trouble!“ Luo Tian muttered internally. It wasn't that he had become merciful, but he had already made too many enemies. Now, his goal was to ensure Tianyuan Sect entered the Middle Three Heavens and stabilized. Bai Ye held a high position in Mount Xumi, and with Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang's cooperation, they could have captured him. But Luo Tian didn't want to provoke trouble. After all, Bai Ye's back was Mount Xumi, and he had already offended them once before. Though it was resolved by Bu Tian Immortal King, Luo Tian didn't want to clash with Mount Xumi again.

Luo Tian ignored Bu Tian Shi's continued outbursts and flew with Meng Wushuang for four days, arriving at Shahuai City.

Chapter 2401: Rapid Progress

Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang didn't linger in Shahuai City. They returned to the Lower Three Heavens' Tianyuan Sect as quickly as possible.

Upon returning, Luo Tian handed over Zhao Tian Tower and the Eight Treasures Jade Immortal Stones to everyone. They arranged for them to process it. Wan Lingkong prepared a grand array, transforming the Eight Treasures Jade Immortal Stones into a high platform spanning hundreds of zhang. This place became a sacred site for Tianyuan Sect disciples, with many assigned daily to train within Zhao Tian Tower.

Zhao Tian Tower also opened. These two places instantly became sacred sites for the sect's disciples. Every day, Luo Tian and others arranged large numbers of disciples to train within Zhao Tian Tower.

As Luo Tian was now the master of Zhao Tian Tower, Bu Tian Shi became another artifact spirit. Though Zhao Tian Tower still had dangers, its resources were tempting enough for people to desire. The danger was relatively reduced, but there were still casualties.

Luo Tian and others didn't stop it. After all, to obtain resources, one must pay a price.

The entire Tianyuan Sect entered the right path. Luo Tian and others gradually became less busy, while Nan Gong Yuqing and others chose to enter Zhao Tian Tower to test if they could break through a level.

At this time, the sect's high-ranking members were only Luo Tian, Meng Wushuang, Xiang Tianming, and Diao Dede.

Luo Tian and the others were all Immortal Kings. In these ten years, they could improve their strength but only slightly.

Diao Dede, however, was completely for show. Every day he dressed up and wore an elaborate robe, walking around the sect.

Every disciple of Tianyuan Sect would respectfully greet their master. Diao Dede enjoyed this feeling immensely.

Yet, under these circumstances, Diao Dede's cultivation didn't stagnate but instead advanced more rapidly. His progress was no slower than those who entered Zhao Tian Tower, leaving Luo Tian and others astonished.

In a short time, the entire Tianyuan Sect developed rapidly. Luo Tian occasionally led sect elders and disciples to train in the Lower Three Heavens.

To his surprise, Xinghe Fu and Bu Tian Mountain also gifted Tianyuan Sect a large amount of supplies. Though these weren't as valuable as Zhao Tian Tower, they were nearly comparable.

Every day, thunderous sounds of lightning echoed in Tianyuan Sect. Every day, disciples or elders broke through. The sect developed rapidly.

Time passed slowly. Nine years had passed since the ten years began, and Tianyuan Sect was thriving.

On the mountain peak, Luo Tian gazed into the distance. He saw a prosperous Tianyuan Sect and felt admiration.

Sometimes, he even thought of not fighting for the heavens. Let these people stay in the Lower Three Heavens. After all, if they fought for the heavens, Tianyuan Sect's millions would surely suffer casualties.

„Not fighting isn't possible! Even if you don't want to fight, they won't agree. Cultivators all desire higher realms. Many among them can't become True Immortals!“ Gu Qianxue stood beside Luo Tian. These years had been happy for her, feeling that Luo Tian was completely hers.

„Hmm... There's still one year left. I wonder if those people succeeded!“ Luo Tian gazed into the distance, looking at Zhao Tian Tower on Tianyuan Sect's mountain peak. A smile appeared in his eyes.

These years, Luo Tian had gathered many intelligence about the Silk Cocoon Valley. The Silk Cocoon Valley's open strength was three Immortal Kings. One was an Immortal King mid-phase elder, Qin Huaiyuan. Two were early-phase Immortal Kings: the sect master Qin Tianming and the junior sect master Qin He Feng.

This was just their open strength. In fact, the Silk Cocoon Valley had another early-phase Immortal King, making a total of four.

„With the three of us and an Immortal King mid-phase puppet, we should be able to deal with them. Even adding Zhao Tian Tower, we have a chance of victory!“

„But I'm worried about the Eternal Life Mountain. If they do something, and if one of them can reach early-phase Immortal King, it would be more secure!“ Luo Tian mused. Immortal Kings and True Immortals were the key to this battle for the heavens.

„Buzz...“ As Luo Tian muttered, Zhao Tian Tower emitted radiant light. A figure stepped out of Zhao Tian Tower, its aura reaching the heavens.

„Monkey Brother!“ Luo Tian's eyes widened. He saw a shimmering figure, his face showing joy as he flew toward the figure.

„Immortal King early-phase!“ Xiang Tianming and Fire Master also felt the aura of the figure, their faces showing joy.

„No wonder he's a battle saint monkey. His growth speed is so fast!“ Meng Wushuang's face showed admiration, sensing the figure's name.

„Luo Tian, one battle!“ The figure, Yaochen, soared into the sky. Golden domains surrounded him. He held a golden staff and gazed at Luo Tian with battle intent.

„Old habits again!“ Luo Tian's lips twitched. He flew into the sky and clashed with Yaochen, their domains colliding.

Cracking sounds echoed. Two domains collided instantly, constantly clashing. Luo Tian and Yaochen stood still, their auras accumulating.

Time passed. After an hour, Yaochen's golden domain finally couldn't withstand the pressure and cracked with a sound. Luo Tian's轮回 Domain also had many cracks, appearing on the verge of collapse.

Domains shattered. Yaochen showed no surprise. His domain had just formed, naturally not a match for Luo Tian's stable轮回 Domain after years of cultivation. Though Luo Tian's cultivation was suppressed to half an Immortal King, his domain still existed—this was Luo Tian's special trait. His轮回 Domain wasn't formed by heavenly forces but by spiritual force, unapproved by the heavens.

The golden staff swept across the cosmos, pressing down on Luo Tian's domain.

„Crack...“ The grey domain shattered under the golden staff, still sweeping toward Luo Tian's direction.

Luo Tian laughed and his hand flashed black light. The Cracking Heaven Spear appeared in his palm, piercing through space to clash with the golden staff.

Luo Tian's cultivation was suppressed to half an Immortal King, so both fought with restraint, merely testing each other.

Thunderous sounds echoed across the eight directions. The sky trembled. Luo Tian and Yaochen both retreated, their auras rising again as they clashed once more.

Simple and brutal. They continuously collided with spear and staff, shaking the sky and earth. All Tianyuan Sect disciples looked at the two figures with awe.

„Luo Sect Master... No, Luo Tian Elder is truly formidable!“

„Who is this monkey who can match Luo Tian Elder?“ The disciples of Tianyuan Sect whispered, their admiration for the two figures boosting their own morale.

After an hour of fighting, Luo Tian and Yaochen stopped. Yaochen's face showed a smile, taking a deep breath and laughing loudly, standing in the world.

„Roar...“ As Yaochen roared, a series of dragon cries echoed from Zhao Tian Tower. A powerful pressure spread.

Dragon aura surged. A golden light rose, forming a golden dragon that soared into the sky. The golden tail swept toward Yaochen fiercely.

„Good!“ Yaochen saw the golden dragon, his eyes flashing battle intent. He laughed and struck a fist toward the golden tail.

„Boom...“ The thunderous sound echoed. The golden dragon's tail collided with Yaochen's fist, the sky that had just calmed shattering again.

„Another Immortal King early-phase!“ Everyone's eyes showed shock, watching the golden dragon hovering in the sky.

„I didn't expect you to get there first!“ The golden dragon transformed into a handsome figure, appearing in people's sight. Yaochen's eyes showed joy again, his battle intent rising. He had felt unsatisfied fighting with the suppressed Luo Tian and now gazed at Longjie.

„Now, who is my Dragon Ascension Sect's opponent! Five Immortal Kings!“ The disciples of Tianyuan Sect were completely excited.

„Want to fight a bit?“ Yaochen addressed Longjie, turning his staff.

„No fighting...“ Longjie shook his head. He didn't want to fight with this battle maniac, who would never end.

„I wonder how they're doing!“ Luo Tian muttered internally. He and Yaochen, Longjie landed in Tianyuan Sect.

„Everyone, fight hard! Now our Dragon Ascension Sect has surpassed the Silk Cocoon Valley!“ Diao Dede stood up, crossing his arms and addressing Tianyuan Sect's people.

„Yes!“ A roar of voices echoed on the mountain, a fierce battle spirit erupting and spreading from Tianyuan Sect toward all directions.

Time passed slowly. Another nine months had passed, leaving only three months until the battle for the heavens. The entire Tianyuan Sect finally began to gather, as they also needed three months to cross the Illusory Heaven Sea.

Diao Dede, Luo Tian, Nan Gong Yuqing and others stood in the sky. In nine months, Nan Gong Yuqing and others hadn't broken through to early-phase Immortal King but had significantly improved their strength, nearly ready for the breakthrough.

„Depart!“ Diao Dede shouted loudly. His voice carried authority, making Tianyuan Sect's people solemn. A fleet of warships arrived from Xinghe Fu, the leading one being Star Cloud Boat, a treasure of Xinghe Fu.

„Yes...“ A series of figures soared into the sky, flying to their assigned warships. It took two days for everyone to fully board the ships.

This time, Luo Tian had learned wisdom. He remembered how once his Dragon Ascension Sect fought for the heavens and was destroyed, leaving behind the weak and elderly of Tianyuan Sect. Thus, Luo Tian had ordered Wan Lingkong to set up a grand array and left behind an Immortal King mid-phase puppet.

After handling everything, Star Cloud Boat pierced through the heavens and rushed toward the Illusory Heaven Sea.

Chapter 2402: The Battle Site

„Rumbling...“ One hundred warships, four million people followed Star Cloud Boat toward the Illusory Heaven Sea.

„Flying Dragon Sect, sending off Tianyuan Sect...“ Another series of reverent voices echoed in the Lower Three Heavens. Luo Tian stood at the bow of Star Cloud Boat, hearing these familiar voices. His eyes showed admiration, as if returning to a hundred years ago when Dragon Ascension Sect fought for the heavens.

„Time passes so quickly!“ Luo Tian muttered internally. Though he knew most sects didn't believe in Tianyuan Sect's success.

„Once Tianyuan Sect enters the Middle Three Heavens, it will be in the top three!“ Luo Tian muttered internally, watching the sects sending off Tianyuan Sect.

„You want me to return the battle command? You're dreaming!“ Luo Tian watched the sects' longing eyes. He wouldn't repeat the mistake Dragon Ascension Sect made before.

„Four million people, countless True Immortal peaks. This battle for the heavens will be the grandest!“ People whispered, watching Tianyuan Sect's formidable formation.

Time passed. One hundred warships thundered into the Illusory Heaven Sea, their massive ships cutting through the sea toward the Middle Three Heavens. Under the eyes of the Lower Three Heavens, Tianyuan Sect's warships vanished, people showing admiration.

„It's a pity for Tianyuan Sect!“ Everyone felt sorrowful, even the Middle Three Heavens.

At the same time Tianyuan Sect's people entered the Illusory Heaven Sea, warships also appeared on the Illusory Heaven Coast of the Middle Three Heavens. Their power was even more overwhelming. Several figures soared into the sky, their faces cold as they stepped into the Illusory Heaven Sea.

„Wait here for a while before departing. Tianyuan Sect's people will be surprised to see us!“ A middle-aged man smiled, this being the Silk Cocoon Valley's sect master, Qin Tianming.

A few days ago, the Silk Cocoon Valley had gathered here. They sealed the coast and information because they decided to set the battlefield in the Illusory Heaven Sea. They calculated the timing, hoping that the Immortal Kings suppressed in the Lower Three Heavens wouldn't recover their strength.

Luo Tian and others were completely unaware, still sailing through the vast Illusory Heaven Sea.

Time passed slowly. Two months had passed. As they approached the Middle Three Heavens, Luo Tian, Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming's strength gradually recovered.

„Everyone rest well. In half a month, we should arrive at the Illusory Heaven Coast. There we will face the Silk Cocoon Valley!“ Luo Tian addressed everyone.

„Crash...“ As Luo Tian's words just finished, a series of waves sounded. A massive wave appeared tens of thousands of zhang away from Tianyuan Sect's warships, even at such a distance, the sound of waves could be heard.

Under the massive wave, over one hundred warships cut through the water toward Luo Tian's direction. Their speed was astonishing.

„What's happening?“ Luo Tian and others gazed into the distance, looking at the water and sky connected massive waves. A bad feeling arose in their hearts.

„Silk Cocoon Valley!“ As he spoke, the澎湃 waves were only four thousand zhang away from Luo Tian's group. But Luo Tian saw the warships approaching with banners bearing the words „Silk Cocoon Valley“.

„Everyone prepare for battle!“ As soon as they saw the words „Silk Cocoon Valley“, Luo Tian, Meng Wushuang and Xiang Tianming shouted. Their voices carried urgency.

„What?“ In an instant, Tianyuan Sect's people were stunned. Their eyes showed shock as they quickly appeared on their warships.

„Everyone, drive the warships forward!“ Luo Tian coldly ordered. He hadn't expected the Silk Cocoon Valley to attack into the Illusory Heaven Sea.

„Boom...“ As Luo Tian's words just finished, one hundred warships' speed suddenly surged. Thundering, they rushed toward the Silk Cocoon Valley's warships.

Three thousand zhang... Two thousand zhang...

Both sides' speed was fast. In an instant, Luo Tian could see the face of Qin Tianming on the opposing warships with a mocking expression.

„Luo Tian, today is your death!“ Qin Tianming roared. His warship emitted a torrent of divine light, emitting loud explosions as it rushed toward Luo Tian's group.

„Damn!“ Luo Tian immediately understood the Silk Cocoon Valley's intention. Especially when he saw an old man behind Qin Tianming, his group's faces darkened.

„How long until you recover!“ Luo Tian asked. Now, Tianyuan Sect had no Immortal King.

„I've recovered to early-phase Immortal King, but...“ Meng Wushuang spoke. An early-phase Immortal King was no help.

„About one day!“ Xiang Tianming spoke. This brought a shadow to everyone's hearts.

„One day, how can we survive one day!“ Luo Tian cursed. He also needed about a day.

„First, crash them!“ But then, Luo Tian didn't think further. He and everyone drove Star Cloud Boat toward Qin Tianming's warships.

Boom... Boom...

In an instant, the heavens and earth thundered. Luo Tian's group's Star Cloud Boat collided with a golden warship.

At the same time, Tianyuan Sect's one hundred warships connected into a single formation and collided with the Silk Cocoon Valley's warships. The Illusory Heaven Sea seemed to be lifted, massive waves rising like breaking the heavens.

„Boom...“ In an instant, a large number of people were instantly destroyed in this collision. Blood immediately dripped into the Illusory Heaven Sea.

„Cough...“ Luo Tian's group looked grim, flying up to look at the direction of Tianyuan Sect. One hundred warships had been completely destroyed, a series of figures appearing behind Luo Tian's group in a desperate manner. Their eyes showed fear as they looked at the Silk Cocoon Valley people who had also begun to gather.

In just one confrontation, both sides suffered heavy losses. Tianyuan Sect lost dozens of millions, and the Silk Cocoon Valley was no better.

„You are Luo Tian?“ A senior stood at the front of the Silk Cocoon Valley's group, gazing at Luo Tian's group. His eyes narrowed slightly.

„So many half-Immortal Kings?“ Seeing Luo Tian's group, the Silk Cocoon Valley people were slightly surprised.

„Qin Huaiyuan. The battle site was supposed to be in the Middle Three Heavens. Why did you dare defy the Nine Immortal Mountains' command and enter the Illusory Heaven Sea? Don't you fear the wrath of the Illusory Heaven Sea's master?“ Fire Master shouted, clearly recognizing Qin Huaiyuan.

„Meng Wushuang!“ Seeing Meng Wushuang, Qin Huaiyuan's eyes immediately widened. He knew Tianyuan Sect had more than one Immortal King but hadn't expected it to be Meng Wushuang.

„Why are you not staying in Shahuai City but coming to Tianyuan Sect?“

„But I don't care where you are. Now, give me a chance to leave this place and return to your Shahuai City. I'll pretend nothing happened!“ Qin Huaiyuan coldly spoke, his eyes looking down at Luo Tian's group.

„Get lost... What are you!“ Meng Wushuang naturally didn't regard Qin Huaiyuan. Even now, his cultivation was suppressed to early-phase Immortal King.

„Then we can only destroy you!“ Qin Huaiyuan's face darkened. He didn't attack immediately but stood there, waiting for the Silk Cocoon Valley's people to gather. Once they were ready, it would be a thunderous strike.

Luo Tian's group also took advantage of the time for Tianyuan Sect to gather, discussing their strategy. After all, their current strength hadn't recovered.

„What should we do? We have no chance of victory in this situation!“ Nan Gong Yuqing spoke.

„I'll take on Qin Huaiyuan...“ Fire Master spoke. At the moment, he was the only one with Immortal King combat strength. He had no choice but to step up.

„I'll take on Qin Tianming!“ Xiang Tianming sighed longingly. His greatest advantage was that he could fully utilize his strength in the Illusory Heaven Sea.

„No, I'll take on Qin Tianming. You take on Qin He Feng!“ Luo Tian spoke and immediately sat down, forming seals to activate the Demon Body Liberation.

„And that early-phase Immortal King senior, we'll take on!“ Yaochen and Longjie spoke. They took on one early-phase Immortal King, though it was challenging, they had no choice but to step up.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian's aura gradually became stronger, his demonic patterns etched on his body with rising demonic energy.

„Breakthrough!“ Luo Tian roared, his body cracking. His aura broke through to early-phase Immortal King.

„Kill!“ As Luo Tian's aura just increased, Qin Huaiyuan roared. The Silk Cocoon Valley's strength behind him immediately erupted. Hundreds of millions of people, shouting and roaring, stepped through blood-red seas toward Tianyuan Sect's people.

„Kill...“ The cries of battle echoed. Tianyuan Sect's people also followed Luo Tian's group and rushed toward the Silk Cocoon Valley's people.

The two groups collided instantly. The endless battlefield shook the heavens and earth, with countless sect members dying in an instant.

„Luo Tian, give me your life!“ Qin Tianming roared and rushed toward Luo Tian.

„Killing you once, I can kill you again!“ Luo Tian's body surged with demonic energy. He showed no fear and rushed toward Qin Tianming.

Fire Master Meng Wushuang, Xiang Tianming and others also launched their attacks. They had previously discussed their opponents and now attacked.

The entire world instantly fell into chaos. Neither the Lower Three Heavens nor the Middle Three Heavens knew that the battle for the heavens had started early.

Luo Tian wielded Longyuan Sword, killing many Silk Cocoon Valley disciples. He finally reached Qin Tianming's vicinity. His black sword struck down, and a grey domain also swept toward Qin Tianming.

Luo Tian launched his attack with full strength. He knew the current situation was too disadvantageous for Tianyuan Sect. He couldn't allow an outcome he couldn't bear.

Chapter 2403: Disadvantage

In the Illusory Heaven Sea, a million miles away from the Middle Three Heavens, the heavens changed. The winds and clouds swirled as two powerful sects clashed in a massive war. This grand battle was unknown to the Middle Three Heavens.

The Illusory Sea turned red. Two sects fought for their lives, each breath claiming hundreds of thousands of deaths.

„Boom...“ Luo Tian appeared like a demon god, instantly before Qin Tianming. His fierce aura made Qin Tianming's face change. He remembered the shadow Luo Tian had left him in Xuan Yue Realm.

„You're not in Xuan Yue Realm now. How can you defeat me!“ Qin Tianming quickly regained his composure, drawing a white long sword. The moment he took it out, the blade vanished.

„Crack...“ A collision sound echoed. Longyuan Sword seemed to be blocked by something, stopping Luo Tian's body. His eyes narrowed.

„An invisible sword?“ Luo Tian muttered internally, not taking it seriously. After all, with his strength, he could judge Qin Tianming's attack just by observing his initial move. This was one of Luo Tian's terrifying traits—his incredible combat ability.

Qin Tianming retreated, his eyes showing disbelief. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so strong even outside Xuan Yue Realm.

„...“
