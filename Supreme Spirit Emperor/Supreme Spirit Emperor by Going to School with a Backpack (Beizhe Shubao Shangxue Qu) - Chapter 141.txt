After a lively gathering, Luo Tian followed Gu Qianxue and others towards the back mountain of the Pill Hall, where the Gu family now resided.

The Five Elements Sect's overall strength had risen significantly; naturally, the Gu family hadn't lagged behind. Given their relationship with Luo Tian, the Gu family's power had surged year by year.

Everyone returned to their respective residences. Xu Liyi and Tian Luo were also assigned accommodations by Five Elements Sect disciples. Naturally, Luo Tian wouldn't let them go unnoticed; with their addition, the Five Elements Sect's strength had undeniably improved.

The Gu family still lived alone in the back mountain of the Pill Hall. By dusk, the household remained lively and decorated with lanterns—because at noon, they had learned that Luo Tian had returned to the Five Elements Sect with Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

Upon their return, the entire Gu family was filled with joy. The family members had already eagerly waited at the front gate, anticipating Luo Tian and the others.

"Uncle Tiantian, do you think this outfit looks good? Is it too imposing? It's been so long since the two of them saw me—might this be inappropriate?" Gu Yun looked anxious, asking Tiantian.

"Enough, your outfit is fine. Don't change it again; this is the sixth one you've worn!" Tiantian's face showed exasperation, his gaze drifting elsewhere.

"Haha, it's the first time I've seen the family head so nervous!" The Gu family disciples smiled and whispered among themselves.

Ning Yuer stood amidst the crowd, gazing at the gate with a look of excitement.

Under the watchful eyes of the Gu family, Luo Tian and the others displayed a gentle expression as they stepped through the front gate.

"Luotian! Master, Miss!" As Luo Tian and the others entered the Gu family's gate, the entire household erupted into a deafening cheer, surrounding them.

"Ugh..." The four of them were momentarily stunned before their expressions softened.

Especially Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, seeing the familiar faces around them, felt a long-lost sense of home, their eyes glistening with tears.

"Dad!" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei instantly spotted the white-haired Gu Yun among the crowd, kneeling to the ground.

"Thank goodness you've returned. These years have been hard on both of you; it's my fault, I lacked the strength!" Gu Yun wept, his face streaked with tears. For years, Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei had been a thorn in his heart, filling him with guilt.

"Get up, get up!" Gu Yun quickly helped them to their feet, embracing the two.

"Qianxue, how is your mother?" Gu Yun hesitated, his eyes filled with hope as he looked at Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue. He thought of them being in the Yinling Sect, where they must have met Shangguan Feiyan.

"Dad, you don't need to ask—why not go and ask her yourself?" Gu Lei smiled, looking behind him at Luo Tian.

"Ugh... Luotian!" Gu Yun's face showed confusion, then a look of apology upon seeing Luo Tian.

"Apologies, Luotian! I got carried away and forgot about you!" Gu Yuan patted his head, a look of regret on his face.

At that moment, all the Gu family members looked at Luo Tian with excitement, watching the boy who had once entered the Gu household at the Cultivation Body stage.

If not for Luo Tian, the Gu family might have declined further; there would have been no chance to rescue Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei from the Yinling Sect.

"Uncle, no need for formality. Today's star is you!" Luo Tian smiled, stepping aside to reveal Shangguan Feiyan standing behind him.

At that moment, Shangguan Feiyan's eyes were hazy with tears, her gaze fixed on Gu Yun as if she had fallen into his arms.

"Buzz..." Upon seeing Shangguan Feiyan, Gu Yun stood motionless before his robust body trembled violently. His previously calm eyes rekindled with excitement, and he instantly appeared before Shangguan Feiyan.

His trembling hands pulled her into an embrace, feeling the reality of the person in his arms, he growled lowly: "This isn't a dream. This isn't a dream! Ha!"

"Yun Ge!" Shangguan Feiyan, equally excited, whispered softly.

Luo Tian, Gu Qianxue, Gu Lei, and Tiantian felt a strange ache in their hearts. They didn't disturb the two but remained silent, smiling as they watched them embrace.

"One hour... Two hours..." Gu Yun and Shangguan Feiyan remained in a tight embrace for half an hour before they finally regained their senses.

"Ugh..." Gu Yun was the first to recover, his face flushed slightly before he separated from Shangguan Feiyan and coughed lightly to mask his embarrassment.

After Gu Yun's movement, Shangguan Feiyan also realized the situation and blushed, unsure how to speak. The two stood awkwardly like young people in their twenties.

"Haha, dad and mom, I understand. A long separation is like a new marriage, especially after being apart for so long!" Gu Lei smiled and addressed Gu Yun and Shangguan Feiyan.

"Haha!" Gu Lei's words caused the entire family to laugh.

"Little bastard, come here!" Seeing his son mocking him, Gu Yun ignored his embarrassment and waved a hand, slapping Gu Lei's head hard. The family laughed again.

Luo Tian watched the touching scene with a smile, crossing his arms as he was surrounded by the Gu family into the main hall.

The hall had already prepared water and wine; the entire Gu household was lively, with laughter and joy echoing throughout the Pill Hall. No one said anything because everyone knew Luo Tian was there.

"Luotian Brother!" Ning Yuer, her face filled with excitement, approached Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue sitting together.

Seeing Ning Yuer, Luo Tian's eyes lit up. She was still pure, but now with a touch of vitality.

However, Luo Tian only smiled briefly because he felt Gu Qianxue was watching him with a disapproving gaze.

Chapter 691: Seclusion to Break Through

Seeing Gu Qianxue's disapproving gaze, Luo Tian smiled and habitually patted Ning Yuer's head: "Little girl, your cultivation has improved a bit!"

"Yes, yes! Luotian Brother, I've now reached the late stage of Nascent Soul. In a few days, I'll reach the peak of Nascent Soul!" Ning Yuer's face flashed with pride when she mentioned her cultivation.

"Yes, good. Keep cultivating!" Luo Tian spoke a few more words with Ning Yuer before ending their conversation under Gu Qianxue's disapproving gaze.

"Don't worry, Luotian Brother, I'll always be your sister!" Ning Yuer smiled contentedly, looking at Luo Tian before returning to her seat and whispering to herself.

"You have many sisters!" Gu Qianxue smiled playfully, her icy hand firmly gripping Luo Tian's waist.

"No, no—just this one! I truly consider Yuer my sister!" Luo Tian's lips twitched, his face showing a fawning smile without daring to use his energy to protect himself.

"Hmph, if I see you have any more sisters, you'll regret it!" Gu Qianxue threatened, gently releasing her grip.

"Luotian Brother!" But before Gu Qianxue could收回 her hand, a clear voice echoed in Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue's ears.

"Ugh?" Upon hearing the voice, Gu Qianxue's face changed, and she re-clutched Luo Tian's waist.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian couldn't help but gasp, his face showing a bitter expression as he looked at a girl around fifteen years old skipping towards him.

"Luotian Brother, you're really amazing! You've truly brought back Qianxue Sister!" The girl's face showed innocence, making it impossible to be angry.

"Haha, Gu Yunyao has grown up too! Qianxue, you don't recognize her? She's Gu Yunyao, your third uncle's daughter!" Luo Tian spoke softly to Gu Qianxue.

"Yunyao?" Gu Qianxue slowly released her grip on Luo Tian's waist, a look of confusion on her face. When she left, Gu Yunyao was still an infant in a cradle; now she had grown so much that it felt strange.

Gu Yunyao was too lively, and being her sister made Gu Qianxue quickly become familiar with her, leaving Luo Tian aside.

Luo Tian shook his head helplessly, gazing gently at the lively Gu household hall before slowly stepping out.

Luo Tian's current strength made it easy to remain unnoticed. Walking on the main road, he looked at the familiar scenery around the Five Elements Sect, his face calm.

"This is my home; I won't allow anyone to destroy it!" Luo Tian looked at the blood-red half-moon in the sky, whispering softly before vanishing from his spot and appearing in the small courtyard he had once lived in.

Though it had been a long time since his return, the yard was still spotlessly clean, warming Luo Tian's heart. He guessed it must be Ning Yuer who had been cleaning it all along.

"Now I'm at the middle stage of Nascent Soul, though my strength is formidable for people on Tianyuan Continent, it's still far from enough! At least I need to reach the peak of Nascent Soul to protect the Five Elements Sect!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with intense light in the night, illuminating the small room.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and a storage bag appeared in his palm—this was the storage bag that Luo Xiong had given him before he left.

His spiritual sense flickered, and the items inside the storage bag instantly appeared in Luo Tian's mind, making him gasp.

"Three nine-grade elixirs, five eight-grade elixirs!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with excitement.

"There's nearly half a year left; I'll try to break through to the peak of Nascent Soul!" Luo Tian's face showed determination. He waved his hand, creating a barrier to cover his small courtyard.

After that, Luo Tian didn't hesitate and placed one of the eight-grade elixirs into his mouth.

The power of the eight-grade elixir transformed into a terrifying long dragon, directly rushing through Luo Tian's meridians and flowing along them.

"Eight-grade elixirs are truly different! I wonder what kind of terrifying power nine-grade elixirs possess!" Luo Tian didn't divert his attention, his face showing a serious expression as he activated the Five Elements Transformation Technique to refine the fierce power.

Time passed quickly; Luo Tian had been seated in his small house for seven days. Many disciples of the Five Elements Sect wanted to visit Luo Tian, and even other sects had people coming. Upon seeing the barrier outside his courtyard, they didn't disturb him again.

"This child, upon returning, has been so diligent!" The five elders smiled at Luo Tian's courtyard.

"It seems the Five Elements Sect has never had a sect leader. I think it's time to announce it. With this kid's strength, I doubt the five of us old bones could match him!" The five elders discussed.

"Five Elements Sect's Pill Hall, Luo Tian, is our sect leader. From today onwards, for the next month, if anyone不服, they can challenge Luo Tian. If Luo Tian loses, he'll step down from the sect leader position!" The elder of Jin Guang Feng spoke with a smile, his aged voice echoing in the ears of the Five Elements Sect disciples. The disciples paused slightly before becoming lively again.

"Haha, it's unanimous!" Gu Lei stood outside the Gu family courtyard and laughed heartily.

"Luo Tian Senior Brother as sect leader, we accept it. If anyone不服, they can come to me!" Jiang Yucheng, a disciple of Wei Mingxuan, spoke.

Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Dong Sansi, Feng Qianyu, etc., also spoke up in support of Luo Tian.

"This seems to be the most harmonious selection of sect leader since the Five Elements Sect was founded!" Wei Mingxuan stood in his hall, his mouth twitching as he recalled the difficulty of his own selection as sect leader. A look of envy appeared on his face.

After seven days, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes and spoke softly: "Eight-grade elixirs are truly different! But they still have some difficulty in advancing me to the late stage of Nascent Soul!"

Luo Tian sighed, taking out two more eight-grade elixirs and placing them in his mouth. He closed his eyes again, and his aura became even more violent, with the entire body emitting a sound like waves crashing against the shore.

"Is Luo Tian trying to play with death?" Xu Liyi and others felt their spiritual senses, looking at the figure seated in the small house with expressions of surprise.

"I wish I could play with death, but I don't have eight-grade elixirs! Luo Tian really has a good grandfather!" Xu Liyi smiled bitterly, his gaze filled with admiration.

Today is the fifth day of six chapters... Starting tomorrow, it will return to three chapters...

Chapter 692: Advancing to the Late Stage of Nascent Soul

Five Elements Sect, Pill Hall. Luo Tian sat in his small house for the fourteenth day. The aura from his body was slowly gathering, like a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.

"Boom..." Suddenly, Luo Tian opened his eyes with a look of surprise, and a thunderous sound echoed from his body, shaking the room's decorations.

"Advancement?" Xu Liyi and others opened their eyes, looking at Luo Tian with joy and surprise.

"Buzz..." A massive spiritual energy formed a familiar spiritual vortex, enveloping the entire Five Elements Sect and rushing into Luo Tian's courtyard.

Feeling the exhilarating sensation of spiritual energy entering his body, Luo Tian couldn't help but exclaim softly, like a glutton, hungrily absorbing it into his body.

An hour later, Luo Tian had absorbed the extremely concentrated spiritual energy into his body. His aura surged and became Nascent Soul Late Stage.

"Late stage of Nascent Soul!" Xu Liyi and others looked at Luo Tian with envy. Among these people, only Luo Tian could advance so quickly because he had eight-grade elixirs and nine-grade elixirs that others didn't.

Advancing to the Nascent Soul Late Stage, Luo Tian showed no surprise. Three eight-grade elixirs still couldn't reach the Nascent Soul Late Stage, so these elixirs were truly cheap.

"Ninety-grade elixir!" Luo Tian waved his hand, a look of hesitation on his face. He was confident he could now refine eight-grade elixirs, but for nine-grade elixirs, he was still unsure. Nine-grade elixirs were treasures; they weren't something ordinary alchemists could refine.

In Luo Tian's memory, only Sichu Chen was a nine-grade alchemist. As for his master Zhang Daotian, Luo Tian didn't know what level he was at now. However, he felt that even if Zhang Daotian wasn't a nine-grade alchemist, he was close to it.

After hesitating for a while, Luo Tian still felt reluctant but ultimately kept the nine-grade elixir.

"Now I can fully refine eight-grade elixirs; it's better to make more and elevate the strength of Qianxue and others. When I reach the nine-grade alchemist level, I'll strive to enter the Nascent Soul Peak before the great battle!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, then flew up. His spiritual sense transformed into sound, giving instructions to Xu Liyi and others before becoming a long rainbow and flying out of the Five Elements Sect.

"Daan Forest! It's been a while since I last went there; I wonder how Long Jian and Master Shangguan are doing!" Luo Tian smiled, flying towards Daan Forest.

"This kid really never rests!" Xu Liyi and others heard Luo Tian's instructions but hadn't reacted yet when he had already disappeared from their sight.

Half a day later, Luo Tian arrived at the edge of Daan Forest. Time had changed; when he first entered the Cultivation Body stage, he had been cautious in Daan Forest. Now his strength and perspective were different.

The terrifying Daan Forest that once gave Luo Tian a sense of fear now seemed mysterious to him. Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile as he appeared in the sky above Daan Forest, flying deeper into it.

Along the way, Luo Tian encountered many spiritual soul stage beasts, but due to his powerful aura and the aura of the Nai Pian Dragon Seal on his wrist, no beast dared to approach.

"Kid, now that you're stronger, you dare to show off in my Daan Forest!" Long Jian's voice filled with laughter echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him happy. His speed increased again as he flew towards the source of the voice.

After flying for a while, Luo Tian finally found the cave where Long Jian had once moved him. He looked at Long Jian and his wife standing outside with a respectful expression.

"Brother!" Long Baby, also known as Long Jie, appeared before Luo Tian with a childish face, surprising him.

At that moment, the aura from Long Jie made Luo Tian feel shocked. After entering the Xian Gu Relic Area, Long Jie had felt a summoning force that made him leave alone and hadn't seen Long Baby since.

When Luo Tian and others left, Luo Xiong had told him that Long Jie was receiving a transmission from an ancient dragon power. That transmission hadn't even allowed Luo Xiong to enter.

"Peak of Nascent Soul!" Luo Tian felt jealousy as he looked at Long Jie. His own cultivation had been hard-earned, but compared to Long Jie's, it was far behind. Long Jie had simply stayed in Daan Forest for a while and reached the Soul Awakening Peak, then received a transmission to reach the Nascent Soul Peak. This made Luo Tian feel very annoyed.

"Kid, what's your business here in my Daan Forest?" Long Jian smiled proudly as he spoke to Luo Tian, obviously seeing Luo Tian's expression and feeling happy.

Unbeknownst to Luo Tian and Long Jian, Long Baby's current strength was greatly related to Luo Tian. Every time Long Baby's strength surged, it was usually after Luo Tian's strength had surged. The two were in a symbiotic relationship; actually, Luo Tian slightly dominated the contract between them.

"I... Master, I came to Daan Forest mainly to visit you two! Also, I need some medicinal herbs!" Luo Tian saw Long Jian's gaze and didn't dwell on it. After all, it was good that Long Jie was strong.

"Haha, speak up! Whatever herbs you need, just say it; these herbs are wasted here!" Long Jian saw Luo Tian's awkwardness and felt good, patting his shoulder generously.

"Done!" Long Jie sighed in despair, knowing Luo Tian's character well. Seeing his father so generous, it was impossible for Luo Tian to miss this opportunity.

"Go on, Black Tiger, take Luo Tian to the herb storage and let him choose freely!" Long Jian ordered the black tiger behind him.

Luo Tian's eyes sparkled, he bowed respectfully and thanked Long Jian before jumping onto Black Tiger's back.

"Boom..." After Luo Tian jumped onto Black Tiger's back, the massive black tiger's entire body sank heavily, with four thick legs like ancient trees sinking into the ground and bending slightly.

"Grass! Kid, you're so vengeful? I just patted you a few times back then, did it really have to be this?" Black Tiger's tiger face showed a human-like smile as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Haha, Black Tiger Master, you're strong and mighty! How could I dare to hold a grudge against you?" Luo Tian smiled, slowly releasing his pressure.

"Hmph, you're smart. If you continued to embarrass me, in Daan Forest, you wouldn't get a single herb!" The black tiger snorted and took Luo Tian away.

Chapter 693: Robbery Tactics

"Go on, take it yourself!" Black Tiger led Luo Tian to a cave and spoke with impatience.

Luo Tian bowed respectfully, although his current strength was stronger than Black Tiger's, he still considered Black Tiger a senior due to their hierarchy and because Black Tiger had once saved his life in Beichang County.

Black Tiger didn't say more, his body flickered with a gust of wind and disappeared from Luo Tian's sight. Luo Tian turned around and walked towards the unassuming cave.

As soon as he entered the cave, Luo Tian was almost blinded by the intense light around him. The walls of the cave weren't made of earth but were completely embedded with various gemstones.

"Little wonder Long Baby loved bright things since childhood; it's because Master Long Jian also has this taste!" Luo Tian felt a bit speechless as he walked forward.

After walking about ten thousand feet, Luo Tian's eyes were stunned; his gaze swept across a grand hall, and he drooled.

Everywhere in the hall were treasures of the land and sky, scattered like trash on the ground. Luo Tian had thought that the herbs he took from Daan Forest were already quite a lot, and he felt a bit embarrassed.

Now he realized that the treasures Long Jian had given him were just a drop in the ocean; the herbs scattered on the ground in this hall could be hundreds of times more than what he had obtained before.

"I won't be polite, Master Long Jian! I don't believe that with so many herbs, I can't become a nine-grade alchemist!" Luo Tian's eyes sparkled with light as he waved his hands repeatedly.

Each time he waved, a large amount of herbs appeared in Luo Tian's storage ring.

Luo Tian spent about an hour to collect all the herbs in this cave into his storage ring.

"Ugh... so tired, it feels like I fought a battle!" Luo Tian took deep breaths, feeling the emptiness around him. His face showed a bit of embarrassment.

"Is this not good? Treat others with kindness, and you'll have a chance to meet them again!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, then waved his hand, placing a small pile of herbs in the center of the hall's ground.

"Ugh!" Luo Tian nodded repeatedly, looking at the small pile of herbs on the ground with satisfaction.

After that, Luo Tian didn't hesitate and walked out of the cave. As soon as he exited the cave, he became a meteor and disappeared from Daan Forest, even using the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven.

"Master Long Jian, I have other matters; I'll take my leave now. When I have time, I will definitely visit again!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in Daan Forest as soon as he disappeared.

"This kid, why is he leaving so quickly? He doesn't know how to respect the elderly!" Long Jian shook his head, trying to close the cave.

But in an instant, a furious dragon roar echoed through Daan Forest: "Luo Tian, you little bastard, come back!"

Long Jian's voice spread far and wide, accompanied by a dragon aura that made all the beasts in Daan Forest tremble.

"What's wrong?" Bai Yuqin looked puzzled, not knowing what had made her husband so angry.

"Master Luo Tian, this little bastard has emptied our herb cave!" Long Jian gritted his teeth and spoke to his wife.

"Too much! Dad, wait here; I'll go catch Luo Tian back!" Long Jie's face showed anger as he transformed into a golden light and chased after Luo Tian.

Long Jian's mouth twitched, watching Long Jie turn into a golden light and shouted: "You little bastard, come back! Don't think I don't know what you're up to!"

But Long Jie seemed not to hear Long Jian's voice and had already disappeared into the world.

"Jie'er! Be careful!" Bai Yuqin smiled bitterly, speaking into the void.

Other beasts looked puzzled at Long Jian and his wife. With their strength, they could easily catch Luo Tian and Long Jie back, but instead of doing so, they only gave a symbolic scolding. Obviously, Long Jian wasn't truly angry.

"Master, why didn't you catch these two kids back?" Black Bear's intelligence was clearly lacking compared to other beasts, asking naively.

"Ah... a big chaos is coming; this chaos might not even be survivable for Daan Forest. Herbs are just dead things, but beasts and humans are alive. If these things can help us survive this disaster, it's worth it!" Long Jian looked into the blood-red moon in the sky with a gloomy expression, his voice filled with worry.

...

At that moment, Luo Tian felt great joy, smiling as he flew leisurely in the sky. He was secretly calculating how to distribute the terrifying herbs in his storage ring.

Just as Luo Tian was relaxed, a series of terrifying fluctuations echoed from the sky, making him stop abruptly. His gaze turned serious as he looked at the void.

The void tore open, and three elders with cold killing intent stepped out of it. They carefully examined Luo Tian.

"Kill!" The three elders didn't speak further but surrounded Luo Tian with cold faces, blocking all his escape routes. Their hands glowed with dark light as they each summoned their weapons and attacked Luo Tian.

"Ugh?" Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion. His spear, "Rip the Sky," instantly appeared in his hand. He had no time to think; three elders at the Nascent Soul Late Stage made him not dare to be distracted. Three spear techniques surged out, blocking the three's attacks.

"Boom..." Three loud explosions echoed in the sky, and the three elders retreated slightly with expressions of surprise.

"Who are you?" Luo Tian repelled them and didn't continue the attack, asking.

"The ones who want your life!" One elder spoke coldly, his long knife slicing out again with powerful wood-element spiritual energy.

The other two elders didn't speak, each holding a long knife and slicing out at Luo Tian.

"Three Nascent Soul Late Stage elders, yet you want to kill me? I don't know what your master is thinking!" Luo Tian's face showed cold killing intent. Since they wanted his life, he had no need to hold back.

Three souls and seven essences radiated dark light within his body, holding the Rip the Sky spear fearlessly. His aura was overwhelming, and he stepped with the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven, facing their attacks without retreating but advancing. His body flickered and appeared before the elder who had spoken first, stabbing with his spear.

"Poof..." The dark spear tip, glowing with cold light, pierced the elder's shoulder.

Chapter 694: It's Been a Long Time Since I Shot Someone

The elder looked surprised, not expecting that despite being at the Nascent Soul Late Stage and having much more experience than Luo Tian, he was pierced in the shoulder by him. Although this spear didn't harm his core, it still shocked the three elders.

Luo Tian didn't give the elder any chance to retaliate, pulling out his spear and causing blood to spray. His fierce fist struck the elder's chest.

"Crack..." The elder transformed into a green light, his red blood scattering in the air and appearing ten thousand feet away.

The other two elders' knives fell, but they only hit Luo Tian's shadow. Their eyes showed shock as their bodies retreated immediately.

"Want to kill me, Luo Tian? You're not qualified!" Luo Tian's eyes were cold and had already guessed the three's identities. His face showed a cold killing intent as he flew towards the other two elders.

"World-Devouring Lotus!" The low voice of the two elders echoed, their hands radiating powerful fluctuations. Their eyes showed caution as they looked at Luo Tian.

At the same time, the elder wounded by Luo Tian stood ten thousand feet away, his face pale. His hands were rapidly moving in the air.

"Buzz..." Three lights shot up into the sky, enveloping Luo Tian and gathering towards his head.

The three-color lotus instantly formed above Luo Tian's head, exerting a powerful pressure that made Luo Tian's body pause.

Cracks in the void formed on the lotus petals, slowly pressing towards Luo Tian, making his eyes show a serious expression.

"Kid, today you must die!" The elder wounded by Luo Tian showed a sinister face. As a Nascent Soul Late Stage master, he had never been wounded in years; now being injured by this kid made him furious.

"High-level martial art of the Heaven level?" Luo Tian stood still, his lips slightly curled with mockery.

This lotus martial art was indeed overwhelming; if he received it directly, he would be injured. However, it wouldn't kill him.

"Crushing Mountain Technique!" Luo Tian moved his hands slightly, a golden mountain slicing through the void with powerful pressure. It rushed like lightning towards the three-color lotus.

"混沌之力, go!" Luo Tian didn't want to give them any chance and let a bit of chaotic power surge out from his body, merging it into the golden mountain.

"Chaotic Power!" Seeing the bit of chaotic power flying from Luo Tian's hands, the three elders suddenly changed faces and showed disbelief.

They were all Nascent Soul Late Stage masters in their sects, naturally knowing how rare chaotic power was. Their faces showed greed.

"Capture him alive!" The three elders looked at each other and moved, ignoring the martial art collision in the sky.

"Looks like you've lived too long!" Luo Tian didn't care about the three elders flying towards him. He pressed his hand, and the golden mountain crashed into the three-color lotus that the elders had conjured.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed, and the void collapsed in large areas. The three-color lotus shattered under the golden mountain's impact, forming a massive mushroom cloud that swept into the void cracks.

Although the three-color lotus was shattered, the Crushing Mountain Technique remained unscathed and rushed towards Luo Tian.

With the Seven Steps of Sealing Heaven, Luo Tian's feet pushed off the void, making it unstable. In an instant, he vanished from his spot.

Luo Tian had left, but the three elders appeared at the location where Luo Tian vanished and collided with the Crushing Mountain Technique.

"Crush..." Luo Tian's lips curled into a smile, his cold voice echoing from his mouth.

As the words fell, the golden mountain crashed and shattered, sending a powerful wave that struck the three elders.

The thunderous sound lasted for more than ten breaths before stopping, and three battered figures appeared in Luo Tian's sight.

"How about now? I'll see who kills whom!" Luo Tian's eyes were cold, his body like a bolt of lightning, vanishing from his spot and appearing before the elder who had spoken earlier. He launched two punches:轮回 (Reincarnation) and 灭生 (Annihilation).

At this moment, the elder was already furious with Luo Tian. However, now they had only one thought: Luo Tian was much stronger than the three of them. They no longer wanted to kill Luo Tian but to escape.

"Crack..." Two punches fell, and the elder's body, already wounded by the Crushing Mountain Technique, couldn't withstand it. He exploded into a cloud of blood.

"Escape..." The blood mist dispersed, and three soul fragments appeared in Luo Tian's sight, transforming into three green lights that flew away.

"Come back!" Luo Tian smiled coldly and sent out a powerful suction, forming an invisible vortex that pulled the three soul fragments to his front.

Three green flames shot out, landing on the three soul fragments of the elder.

"Maybe if you met someone else, your soul speed would allow you to escape. But with me, you don't even have a chance!" Luo Tian's voice was like icy coldness from the abyss, his gaze sweeping over the other two elders.

"Escape..." The two were so scared by Luo Tian that they had lived for years as Nascent Soul Late Stage masters but feared death.

The two elders transformed into two streaks of light, tearing through the void and fleeing in separate directions.

"Escaped one!" Luo Tian sighed, burning the elder who had become a soul fragment and then flew into the void crack where one of the elders had fled.

Luo Tian knew that they had split up and he could only catch one of them, not both.

He entered the void, his surroundings instantly turning dark. Countless spatial currents swept over him, making Luo Tian sigh, thinking that the void was indeed a graveyard for cultivators below the Spiritual Soul stage.

His spiritual sense spread out, and he quickly found the figure of the elder he was chasing.

"Only your luck!" Luo Tian's body flickered and appeared ten thousand feet away from the elder.

"Damn it, why me!" The fleeing elder's face was drenched in sweat as he gritted his teeth and increased his speed.

"Long time since I shot someone!" Luo Tian's mind stirred, and both the Rip the Sky spear and Water Dragon Bow appeared in his hands.

"Buzz..." The bowstring was drawn, the Rip the Sky spear transformed into a streak of light, carrying the power to pierce everything. It instantly appeared behind the elder.
