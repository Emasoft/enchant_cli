The straw effigy in Zhang Chenglong's hands, wrapped entirely in yellow paper, trembled violently. Each sheet of yellow paper shattered continuously.

*Boom...*

With a thunderous roar, scattered straw flew everywhere. A gray spirit soul appeared in the sight of people. The gray spirit soul was as tangible as flesh and blood, standing there with icy eyes gazing at Lo Tian and others. Its rugged features, though a spirit soul, still gave the group an immense pressure, causing Diaodezhu and others to frown.

"Damn it, this still doesn't work?" Zhang Chenglong hadn't expected that even now, Xingtian could still emerge.

This straw effigy was no ordinary one. It had been obtained from the tomb of a high-ranking monk with profound Buddhist wisdom, and was imbued with Buddhist blessings—treasures of the highest order.

"I'll possess you directly!" Xingtian roared, his solid spirit soul rushing toward Lo Tian.

"Spirit souls shouldn't be a problem!" Seeing Xingtian charging at him, Lo Tian moved his hands swiftly. A fierce aura radiated from his body, and a gray soul sword materialized in his hand.

"Huh?" Xingtian's spirit soul suddenly halted, sensing an immense pressure on Lo Tian.

"What kind of aura is this?" Xingtian's heart shuddered. It was the first time he felt such overwhelming pressure.

Before Xingtian could recover, Lo Tian moved. The gray soul sword radiated brilliant divine light, and a towering aura erupted from it, slicing toward Xingtian's spirit soul.

"Damn!" Xingtian's face flickered slightly. Seeing the astonishing sword light, he wanted to resist but found his spirit soul moving as if submerged in a swamp, sluggish and slow.

*Boom...*

The gray spirit soul was annihilated by the sword light, causing Zhang Chenglong and Diaodezhu to sigh in relief. Xingtian had been too dangerous.

"Ah, I almost forgot Lo Tian is a Soul-Subduing Master!" Diaodezhu and others felt relieved. If Lo Tian hadn't been a Soul-Subduing Master, they might have faced another fierce battle and suffered heavy losses.

Lo Tian took a deep breath, his gaze turning to Diaodezhu and others with caution. Their brief cooperation had ended, but now that Xingtian was dead, if Diaodezhu and others attacked again, he and Mota would be in a passive position.

"Lo Tian, come with us. This place is too dangerous!" Sunkenian spoke, his gaze fixed on Lo Tian—there was no way he would attack.

"Going back is impossible! If you want to fight, I'll accompany you!" Lo Tian held his bloodstained long sword, gazing at Diaodezhu and others.

"Ugh, it's so annoying!" The group felt uneasy. Though they knew Lo Tian was acting this way due to his amnesia, it still felt uncomfortable.

*Clang...*

As they spoke, a black crystal fell to the ground—left behind by the altar. It was similar to the one from the first altar.

"Another one!" Diaodezhu moved like lightning, his speed astonishing as he grabbed the crystal.

"Dog, you bastard!" Sunkenian and Sima Tuo appeared behind Diaodezhu, their eyes filled with annoyance.

Chapter 2545: Devouring Heaven

" This is a nose!" Mota spoke to Lo Tian, revealing what was sealed within the crystal.

"A nose? Previously it was an eye. Does this mean these altars truly sealed eight places of Xingtian's head?" Lo Tian muttered, his eyes wide with disbelief.

" And who built this altar? Someone capable of obtaining Xingtian's head must not be ordinary!"

"Still, they probably turned to dust by now. After all, time has been too long—nobody could have survived!" Lo Tian mused, awestruck by the ancient world's magnitude.

"Dog, dog, here's this for you. Don't dare to grab the next one!" Sunkenian cursed, trying to stop Diaodezhu from fighting over the next item.

"Blow me! I earned this treasure by my own strength. Why should I give it up? Didn't Old Zhang also keep one for himself?" Diaodezhu sneered, unwilling to let go.

"Old man, I'm just temporarily keeping it. Once we leave here, I'll share it with you! Little Diaodezhu, keep it safe with me!" Zhang Chenglong reached out to take the item from Diaodezhu.

"Grandfather truly is a grandmaster. You should share what you took from the White Family's tomb in Yixiantian, right?"

"Or even the old tomb of Juhetong..." Sunkenian's face twisted with disdain. Once something got into Zhang Chenglong's hands, it never came out.

"Master Dongbo, since your body is weak now, stay here!" Diaodezhu ignored the quarreling Zhang Chenglong and others, turning to look at Dongbo Xin.

"Right. I need to recover. My spirit soul was injured. There's no danger in this city except for the altars. Be careful!" Dongbo Xin spoke, sitting cross-legged on the spot.

"Master Dongbo, keep these pills. We'll come back with you when we leave!" Diaodezhu and others handed some medicinal pills to Dongbo Xin.

"Lo Tian, how about temporary cooperation? We won't chase you. Split the treasures from the altars evenly!"

"Of course, as a condition, we need one thing: Rebirth Grass!" Diaodezhu addressed Lo Tian.

Capturing Lo Tian was impossible. The only option was to travel together, offering some protection. Though it seemed no danger, who knew what they might encounter.

"Rebirth Grass?" Lo Tian's brows furrowed. This herb was crucial for him; his memory restoration depended entirely on the Rebirth Pills, and Rebirth Grass was their main ingredient.

"You don't understand your situation yet!" Lo Tian chuckled, raising his hand to activate the Dao-Heart Sealing Technique.

"What...?"

"Lo Tian, I curse your ancestors!" As Lo Tian activated the Dao-Heart Sealing Technique, Diaodezhu and others' faces changed. They immediately understood what Lo Tian was doing and cursed him loudly.

"Treating us so well, yet you still use the Dao-Heart Sealing Technique on me! That year, when you needed a wife, I helped find one for you. Now you use it on me!" Diaodezhu cursed. Lo Tian was no longer the same as before. Even if he had used the Dao-Heart Sealing Technique on him in the past, Diaodezhu hadn't feared it. But now Lo Tian had amnesia; if he felt bad, he could absorb their cultivation, leaving them no place to cry.

"Still cursing?" Lo Tian grabbed his hand. Their bodies trembled instantly, and black mist seeped into Lo Tian's mouth.

"I'll take ten years of your cultivation. Next time, it won't be so easy!" Lo Tian chuckled, making Diaodezhu and others grimace.

"I swear he's cursed me. See if he keeps doing this, he'll end up killing me! Now my cultivation is all gone!" Sunkenian nearly cried, watching Lo Tian standing there with a smile.

"Kid, wait till your memory returns. I'll beat your ass!" Zhang Chenglong also looked exasperated but chose to back down, as Lo Tian was now unrecognizable. It was the first time Zhang Chenglong had suffered such a loss.

Lo Tian remained expressionless. He hadn't intended to kill Diaodezhu and others, just to avoid any danger.

"Let's go. Let's check what's ahead!" Lo Tian spoke softly, walking with Mota toward the city's depths. He didn't ask for the crystal Diaodezhu had obtained.

Zhang Chenglong and others wore expressions of frustration, following Lo Tian and Mota. They were now completely dominated by Lo Tian. Not only could they not bring him back, but whether they would return intact was uncertain. After all, Lo Tian was the Saint Son of the Wheel-Transcending Sect, while they were just disciples from the Immortal Realm.

They left Dongbo Xin alone to recover his injuries. As they walked through the ruins, searching and gathering treasures, they soon reached the third altar.

Zhang Chenglong and others reluctantly dug up the altar, retrieving a crystal. Inside was an eye.

Seeing Lo Tian store the crystal, Diaodezhu and others said nothing. Mota had no objections either; he only needed one eye.

Fourth altar... fifth altar... They encountered no danger, moving deeper into the city. In total, they obtained four crystals: two ears, a skull cap, and teeth.

"What's the use of all this..." Lo Tian held several black crystals, his eyes filled with confusion and discomfort.

"Give them all to me!" Zhang Chenglong looked at Lo Tian, rubbing his hands. It was the first time he had entered a dangerous place without taking anything and instead worked for others.

"Split them evenly!" Lo Tian kept the crystal that sealed the eye, throwing the remaining four to Diaodezhu and others.

"You're such a good person!" Zhang Chenglong laughed, flying toward the crystals.

" You little bastards, get out of my way!"

"Old man, don't be so high and mighty in front of treasures!" Diaodezhu, Sima Tuo, and Sunkenian gave no respect to Zhang Chenglong, immediately starting a fierce competition.

After struggling for half a day, Diaodezhu was kicked out. Zhang Chenglong obtained the crystals with two ears, while Sunkenian and Sima Tuo each grabbed one.

"Lo Tian, these are all treasures. Bring them to the Wheel-Transcending Sect and study them carefully. Perhaps we can uncover some secrets. Xingtian was a great ancient god after all!" Mota's mouth twitched, confused why Lo Tian would give them away.

"Xingtian isn't an ordinary person. I think it's safer to keep everything here. If something happens, it might be worse," Lo Tian replied, expressing his concerns. If another Dongbo Xin appeared, he couldn't handle it.

"Two altars left—probably the mouth and brain!" Lo Tian muttered, flying toward the city's depths.

An hour later, they arrived at the second-to-last altar. Zhang Chenglong and others prepared to work, but as soon as they touched the altar, their faces slightly changed.

*Buzz...*

An invisible force instantly descended upon Lo Tian and others. The black altar's sky began to twist.

In an instant, their bodies were uncontrollably pulled away from the spot and directly sucked onto the altar.

Lo Tian felt a dizzying headspin, then fell heavily to the ground.

Around him were Mota and Diaodezhu, who also landed beside him, dazed.

"Where are we?" Diaodezhu immediately cried out. He hadn't expected they'd face danger again.

After a while, they realized there was no immediate threat—only endless darkness.

"Unending!" Mota's face darkened. He activated his Moon-Eclipsed Eye, gazing into the distance. Even with his eyesight, he couldn't see how far this space extended.

"Yet there are many bones here," Lo Tian placed the black crystal before his eyes, also seeing far into the distance. He saw many withered bones piled like mountains on the ground.

"We're definitely still on the altar. It must be some force that brought us here," Zhang Chenglong, more experienced, remained calm.

"Head—there's still the brain and mouth. I remember Xingtian had a martial art that devoured a hundred thousand heavenly troops at once!" Mota spoke, his voice filled with fear.

"Devouring Heaven!" Hearing Mota's words, Zhang Chenglong softly uttered the two characters.

"I guess we triggered the altar and made that mouth think it was attacked. Instinctively, it used Devouring Heaven to swallow us here."

"This place must be where Xingtian swallowed them. But time has passed, and they all died here!" Mota spoke, his eyes bitter.

"Are you saying we're inside Xingtian's mouth?" Diaodezhu and others were speechless.

"Probably. More accurately, it's a space connected to his mouth. To escape is very difficult!"

"This space has no exit. We can only die here eventually! Unless we improve our strength and break through this space. Perhaps, after years of effort, I could break it if I reached the late Immortal King stage," Zhang Chenglong spoke, gazing at Lo Tian.

Everyone fell silent. If they remained trapped in this space for millions of years and eventually died, it would be too painful.

"Think of a way. There's no spiritual energy or ghostly qi here, so cultivation is impossible!" Lo Tian shook his head, not willing to give up.

"Xingtian's organs might offer us a way out!" Mota spoke, taking out the crystal he had obtained.

"Nothing else to do but study it!" Lo Tian nodded. There were no other options at the moment.

Chapter 2547: Long Years

A massive crack, wide enough for one person to pass through, appeared on the black space. Lo Tian and others' faces lit up with joy.

"Go..." Lo Tian spoke softly, watching Zhang Chenglong rush through the crack with a smile.

But although the crack was large, it only allowed one person to pass through and was slowly healing.

Diaodezhu ran the fastest, rushing out of the space behind Zhang Chenglong. Then came Sima Tuo, followed by Sunkenian.

Finally, Lo Tian remained. He watched the healing space crack. If he had been a moment later, he might not have escaped.

Lo Tian's body moved like lightning, instantly reaching the crack. But as he stepped one foot through the crack, a powerful suction force acted on his body.

"Damn!" Lo Tian's face turned pale. His body was pulled back by immense force, and the crack could no longer accommodate one person.

"Help me find Xingxuan, Mota!" Lo Tian shouted at the crack. His body fell back into the black space with a thud.

"What's going on?" Sunkenian landed on the ground, watching the slowly healing crack above. His heart tightened.

"Where's Lo Tian?" Diaodezhu and others cried out, only hearing the sound from within the crack.

"Lo Tian didn't come out?" Their faces darkened, immediately understanding. They sat on the ground.

"Done..."

"Lo Tian alone can't break through..." Zhang Chenglong spoke, his voice filled with despair.

"Brother Lo..." Mota's eyes showed sorrow. The events had happened in a flash, and no one expected such an accident at the end.

"What do we do?" The group was stunned. They dared not touch the altar now, as it had a significant connection to this space.

"Improve our strength. When we reach a certain level, we'll come back to rescue him. The lifespan of an Immortal King is long. We can definitely save him before he dies, or this time return and have Zhang Ziping go to the Heavenly Court again to invite the Master of Devouring Heaven here. An Immortal King's late stage could definitely break through that space," Zhang Chenglong spoke calmly, gazing at the black altar representing Xingtian's mouth.

"Quickly. In there, there's no concept of time. Lo Tian's greatest enemy is loneliness!" Zhang Chenglong continued, making Diaodezhu and others tense.

"Lo Tian said Xingxuan was here?" After Sunkenian recalled Lo Tian's words, he understood why Lo Tian had come here.

"Also, we didn't get the Rebirth Grass!" Zhang Chenglong spoke, his brows furrowed.

"Rebirth Grass? It's here!" As Zhang Chenglong's words finished, Sima Tuo's face showed confidence. He waved his hand, and a medicinal herb appeared in his palm—Rebirth Grass.

"Who are you..." Seeing the Rebirth Grass, they were surprised. Especially Mota, who hadn't expected this herb to appear in Sima Tuo's hands.

"Good kid. You've surpassed your master! Your skill of stealing is truly excellent!" Zhang Chenglong's eyes showed admiration, as if recalling something.

"Hey kid, tell us what Lo Tian was doing here. Tell us everything you know!" Zhang Chenglong didn't continue but addressed Mota.

"I don't know!" Mota spoke. He also didn't trust Zhang Chenglong and others, who had even stolen Lo Tian's things. How could he trust them?

"Kid, we're friends of Lo Tian!"

"Also, you don't know what situation you're in now!" Sunkenian chuckled, his gaze unkind toward Mota.

"If you're truly trustworthy, swear blood oaths. Otherwise, I won't say a word. Even if you kill me, I won't speak!" Mota's eyes showed determination.

"Stubborn as expected. No wonder you're a friend of Lo Tian..." Diaodezhu and others didn't get angry but smiled in admiration.

They swore blood oaths. They needed information, to know everything about Lo Tian's time in Hell.

After hearing their oaths, Mota nodded and told Diaodezhu and others what he knew.

"Alright, let's go deeper. No matter what, we must save Xingxuan and Leng Qiuchan!" Zhang Chenglong spoke, walking with others toward the city's depths.

...In the dark space, Lo Tian stood there, gazing at endless darkness. He sighed longingly, feeling that it hadn't been too long but already felt lonely.

"How to get out?" Lo Tian didn't want to sit idly. He also knew his current cultivation couldn't break through this dark space unless he reached the late Immortal King stage and used Six Paths of Reincarnation and Frenzied Wind, giving him a slight chance.

"Frenzied Wind!" Suddenly, Lo Tian thought of an idea—Frenzied Wind. If he could increase his physical strength tenfold, maybe he could open the previous crack.

"How to enhance physical strength?" But Lo Tian soon became despondent. This dark space had nothing, only bones—no way to enhance his physical strength.

"Go!" Lo Tian waved his hand, planting his bloodstained sword into the ground to prevent losing his way. He decided to walk through this dark space.

Lo Tian didn't know what was happening outside, but he kept walking in the darkness. Still, there were no discoveries.

To avoid consuming his cultivation, Lo Tian relied solely on his physical strength. But it was too lonely—no sound at all.

One day... ten days... Time slowly passed. Ten days had gone by, but to Lo Tian it felt like a long time.

"Bone-covered ground. How many people did Xingtian kill!" Lo Tian was shocked, looking at the bones on the ground. The entire space had only these bones to distract Lo Tian's attention.

"If I could have a retreat, it would be better. But I still need to find a way out!" Lo Tian muttered, continuing his walk.

"I've at least walked for a month," Lo Tian gave up. Though he didn't know how much time had passed, he could estimate roughly.

"I won't give up!" Lo Tian's eyes showed stubbornness. He wouldn't let this space defeat him.

One month... two months... Over a year, Lo Tian's eyes showed madness. More than a year of solitude, no sound at all—this made Lo Tian extremely uncomfortable. Every day he walked.

"Again..." Lo Tian took another step, the entire world silent and lifeless. He could feel no ghostly qi presence. His cultivation and physical strength had slightly declined.

Lo Tian finally lost hope, walking for an unknown duration. He decided to return, at least back to the bloodstained sword. The sword contained the soul of Tu Tian, and Lo Tian could still talk to him.

Lo Tian was almost crazy. Returning took another year or so, and he had spent three years walking in this monotonous way, saying not a single word.

"Bloodstained sword!"

"Master Tu Tian, come out and talk to me!" Lo Tian started to summon the soul of his sword. But Tu Tian seemed too exhausted from his previous battle with Jing Wu Ye, and didn't respond at all!

"Little Qi..." Lo Tian pressed his hand to his forehead. The ten-color flame mark on his brow flickered, and Little Qi appeared before him.

"Brother..." Little Qi's eyes showed confusion. The ten-color flames on his head flickered, warming Lo Tian slightly.

"Finally some movement!" Lo Tian sighed longingly. He regretted not summoning Little Qi earlier.

"Over there, burn it..." Lo Tian pointed his finger toward the weak spot.

"Ahh..." Little Qi naturally didn't disobey. He opened his mouth and spat out ten-color flames, which shot into the sky toward the crack.

"This would take at least a century to burn through!" Lo Tian's mouth twitched, watching the ten-color flames covering it. He told Little Qi to stop before they could burn through; Little Qi wouldn't have lasted.

"Good thing you're here!" Lo Tian patted Little Qi's head, sighing longingly. At least now he wasn't so lonely and could talk.

"Can't just stay here. I need to think of another way. Even if I have a way to break through the crack, there might be that suction force again and pull me back!"

"What's this suction force from?" Lo Tian pondered, having nothing else to do. He started thinking about ways out and the suction force that had acted on him.

While Lo Tian was trapped in this space, outside the Ghostly Swamp, several battered figures rushed out of it.

"My god, five years. I'll never come back again! What a place!" A curse echoed.

These people were Diaodezhu and others who had gone deep into the Ghostly Swamp. After five years, they finally found Fu Xingxuan and Leng Qiuchan in a tomb. When they found them, their energy was extremely weak, lying in coffins as if dead.

Using their years of tomb-robbing experience, Zhang Chenglong and Sunkenian rescued them. But they angered the tomb's owner, who chased them until they escaped from the Ghostly Swamp.

"My god, who was that tomb's owner? Even his residual soul had late Immortal King strength. And there were so many mummies!" Diaodezhu treated his wounds, and they all collapsed on the ground.

"It should be an ancient god," Fu Xingxuan's face was pale. It seemed like a forbidden place. She had just found Leng Qiuchan and then fell into the trap.

"I'll take my sister back to the Wheel-Transcending Sect. I need to find a way to save her! She's been in that coffin for too long!" Fu Xingxuan spoke to them.

Chapter 2548: The Incident in the Ghostly King City

"Are you not coming back with us to the Immortal Realm?"

"The Immortal Realm is better than Hell. There are many methods there to heal her!" Diaodezhu frowned, gazing at Fu Xingxuan.

"Qiuchan's sister has too much corpse qi. The Yellow Springs of the Wheel-Transcending Sect can purify it!" Fu Xingxuan replied.

"Will Master Dongbo come out himself?" Faced with Fu Xingxuan's insistence, they said nothing. Diaodezhu and others also worried about Master Dongbo.

"It should be fine. His strength is strong. As long as he doesn't go deep, he'll definitely come out!" They discussed, gazing at the place that terrified them—the Ghostly Swamp.

"I'll have the Wheel-Transcending Sect's Grandmaster come personally to save Lo Tian!" Fu Xingxuan looked worried. She had heard about Lo Tian's situation from Diaodezhu and others, her eyes filled with guilt. But she knew she couldn't save Lo Tian herself.

"Alright, take care. Once I save Lo Tian, I'll find you!" Fu Xingxuan spoke to Diaodezhu and others. As for how they would leave, Fu Xingxuan didn't worry.

They traveled together for a while before parting. Fu Xingxuan and Mota, with the unconscious and stiff Leng Qiuchan, flew toward the Wheel-Transcending Sect.

"Such a vast place! We've been in the Ghostly Swamp for five years. I wonder if the battle between Hell and the Immortal Realm has already reached the Immortal Realm!" Mota and Fu Xingxuan flew through the sky, their faces filled with admiration. The Ghostly King City was their route, so Mota and Fu Xingxuan traveled together. Mota also planned to send Fu Xingxuan to the Wheel-Transcending Sect before returning, as now it was chaotic. Who knew if Fu Xingxuan would encounter danger? She was still weak, and Mota owed Lo Tian a favor. Fu Xingxuan's safety was naturally on his mind.

"Why did they invade?" Fu Xingxuan sighed longingly. Hell's resources weren't any less than the Immortal Realm, just the environment was harsher.

"The Holy Maiden truly values peace. But not everyone is a Holy Maiden, kind and benevolent. Who doesn't have self-interest? These things aren't controlled by us!" Mota spoke softly. He had once been one of Fu Xingxuan's suitors, but now he knew Lo Tian and Fu Xingxuan were almost a certainty.

Time passed slowly. A day later, the two reached the outskirts of the Ghostly King City. But as soon as they arrived outside the city, Mota's face darkened.

The Ghostly King City had once been a heavenly city, naturally grand and prosperous. But now, as they stood outside the city, it looked desolate.

Mota instantly rushed into the Ghostly King City. The city's buildings were mostly ruins, especially the palace of the king, which had been completely flattened.

Some people in the city looked lazy and lacked the former prosperity of the Ghostly King City.

"What's going on?" Mota's hands trembled. He grabbed a passerby.

"Why is the Ghostly King City like this?" Mota asked the man. He knew that after leaving for five years, the city might have changed in a way he found despairing.

"Great... Master..."

"This is the Ghostly King City. Five years ago, the previous Ghostly King took all the city's strong people to Yueling Mountain and never returned."

"Afterward, several strong individuals came to the Ghostly King City and slaughtered all of its original forces. They destroyed the palace, turning it into this state!" The young man trembled as he spoke. Since the city's original forces had been wiped out, he didn't recognize Mota.

"What!" Mota's hands shook violently. He released the young man to the ground.

"The Ten Palaces of Yama have investigated, but they found nothing. And with the war with the Immortal Realm being tense, it was temporarily set aside!" The young man continued.

"Are you the Ghostly King?" Just as the young man's words ended, a voice echoed in Mota and Fu Xingxuan's ears.

"I am!" Mota's face was dark. He felt something wasn't right, and his father was likely in trouble.

The entire Ghostly King lineage might have been wiped out. Since the first Ghostly King's life-preserving method of the Ghostly King lineage was no longer sensed by him.

"Bow to the Ghostly King, Master. I am Lao Guan of the Liu family in the Ghostly King City. I escaped because I wasn't there at that time," an old man trembled as he stepped forward.

"I remember you!" Mota nodded. He had gone to the Ghostly Swamp, and after five years of absence, returning brought a massive change. This left Mota momentarily stunned.

"Master Mota, think positively!" Fu Xingxuan spoke to Mota. She really didn't know what else to say.

"Those people were all strong. Only seven of them wiped out our entire Ghostly King City. When I returned, the city had turned into a sea of corpses. This is how it looks after these two years!" The old man bowed, his eyes filled with admiration. For most people, the Ghostly King City was home; now it was gone.

"圣女, I can't escort you!" Mota's expressionless face spoke.

"Yes, I'll take Qiuchan back to the Wheel-Transcending Sect first. If you need help, just say so!"

"Don't act recklessly!" Fu Xingxuan nodded, gazing at Mota deeply. She flew out of the Ghostly King City.

"Who!" Mota's voice was cold, his entire aura changing. One of his eyes turned into a Moon-Eclipsed Eye, the other an玄月之眼. Gradually, they changed from silver-white to blood-red with divine energy flowing.

"This grudge is what I'll do for the rest of my life!" Mota's calm voice echoed, but everyone could hear the overwhelming hatred and madness in his tone.

...In the dark space, Lo Tian sat cross-legged, his aura calm and still. The entire space was unusually quiet.

He had maintained this posture for years, entering a state of meditation. Thus, he endured it well.

"Devouring Heaven!" Suddenly, two golden lights rose. Lo Tian opened his eyes and exhaled an invisible suction force from his mouth. This action had been performed countless times over the years.

"Buzz..." The void trembled, space twisted. The entire dark space began to twist with Lo Tian's mouth sucking.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation!" Lo Tian's eyes showed joy. He stepped on the ground, flew up, and instantly appeared at the crack's location. He punched with seven shadow fists.

With a thunderous roar, they struck the crack. A sound of cracking echoed.

"Go!" Lo Tian didn't hesitate, flying toward the crack.

The dark sky, black mist, and cold air hit Lo Tian's body. He showed a joyous face, almost crying.

"I'm out! How long have I been trapped!" Lo Tian shouted, looking at the black altar and the broken ruins of the city.

Lo Tian took deep breaths, absorbing ghostly qi to replenish his years of cultivation. It felt very comfortable.

"I wonder if Mota and others found Xingxuan..." Lo Tian muttered, looking at the black altar. He pondered whether to continue deeper or leave from here.

"Devouring Heaven! I've only mastered the basics. To master it fully, I need to obtain the crystals within this altar." Lo Tian muttered. At that moment, only he was in the entire ruined city.

"Once this opportunity is missed, next time even if I enter this Ghostly Swamp, it's uncertain whether I can find this ruined city!" Lo Tian muttered. He carefully observed the altar, but he couldn't destroy it like Zhang Chenglong and Sunkenian. He also feared the suction force would appear again, pulling him in.

"Never mind!" Lo Tian sighed longingly. He cautiously stepped over the altar, walking toward the city's depths.

Time passed slowly. Lo Tian finally reached the city's deepest point. He even saw another gate in the city.

Before the gate was a pile of broken stones. Lo Tian had seen this before—this was what remained after the altar was torn open.

"I guess those guys have already opened the altar that sealed Xingtian's brain. They must have gained a lot!" Lo Tian smiled slightly. After all, the brain was one of the most important parts of a person. He knew they had gone deeper.

Lo Tian stepped forward, walking to the gate without hesitation and exiting this ruined city. A vast wasteland appeared before Lo Tian's eyes.

The entire world was desolate, black mist still obscuring Lo Tian's vision. The ground had no vegetation; it was even cracked. The dark sky emitted a repressive atmosphere.

"This outside is worse than inside the city!" Lo Tian muttered. He activated his Golden Wheel Thunder Eye, piercing through the black mist to see further. At the same time, waves of energy appeared in his mind.

"Over there!" Lo Tian felt these waves. They were the direction where Diaodezhu and others had walked after leaving the city. Lo Tian could sense them with his Golden Wheel Thunder Eye, something others couldn't detect.

Lo Tian followed the faint waves left by them, continuing toward the depths of the Ghostly Swamp.

After walking for three days, Lo Tian hadn't left this wasteland. He was confused but trusted the waves wouldn't be wrong.

Time passed slowly. Lo Tian walked for half a month, and eventually the world changed. A cold wind blew against his body, making Lo Tian's face show joy.

"Better than this!" Lo Tian muttered. He flew up, heading toward the direction of the cold air—exactly where Diaodezhu and others had gone.
