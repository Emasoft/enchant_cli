“Alright, everyone here is an outer gate elder. If there’s something to discuss, let’s settle it now. Disputes between disciples are natural!” A half-step Immortal King spoke.

“Indeed, if there’s a true life-or-death grudge, it could be decided on the arena. Isn’t that right?” A kind-faced elder spoke, but his words did not guide people toward peace.

“Zhou Xiong! Since it’s a matter between disciples, let them handle it themselves. Tomorrow on the Eternal Life Arena, my disciple Zhou Li challenges your disciple Zhou Yuanhao in a life-or-death duel. Do you dare accept?” Luo Xin shouted, his voice laced with disdain.

“Dare? Tomorrow on the Eternal Life Arena, my disciple will challenge all late-stage True Immortals. Who dares to fight him? Let fate decide!”

“Not only that, I’ll bet a hundred six-star immortal pills. Are you willing to gamble?” Luo Tian sneered, his gaze sweeping over the elders. He knew these men sought to trap him, but Luo Tian would grant their wish—after all, he needed Zhou Yuanhao to rise in fame.

“Grand gesture!”

“Zhou Xiong’s pills are endless, it seems!” The crowd roared again, their eyes wide with awe as they gazed at Luo Tian standing there.

“Gamble! If you don’t come, you’re a coward!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the elders’ eyes flickered with excitement. Luoxiu feared Luo Tian might back out and mocked him.

“Finished? Then go!” Luo Tian sneered. These men were merely digging their own graves. The elders were satisfied and left Luo Tian’s courtyard, but many remained kneeling outside his estate, begging to be his disciples. The scene grew increasingly grand.

“Go back. I won’t take any more disciples, Zhou Xiong!” Luo Tian shook his head gently, gazing at Zhou Yuanhao submerged in the medicinal liquid. To reach late-stage True Immortality, Zhou Yuanhao’s absorption rate had improved significantly; a quarter of the elixir was already absorbed, and his injuries had healed considerably.

Time passed. Two hours later, the sun hung high in the sky. Zhou Yuanhao emerged from the medicinal pool, his face etched with guilt.

“Don’t be disheartened. You’ve just entered late-stage True Immortality; naturally, you’ll lag behind them!” Luo Tian chuckled.

“After so many days of combat, you’ve gained some experience, haven’t you?”

“Today I’ll teach you two sword techniques!” Luo Tian spoke softly, raising his hand. A golden longsword materialized in his grasp.

“This sword is called Chasing the Sun Sword. I retrieved it from that treasure vault; it’s a mid-tier immortal artifact, perfect for you!” Luo Tian lightly tapped the blade, producing a resonant hum.

He then waved his hand, erecting a barrier to enclose them. The courtyard outside still held many kneeling figures; Luo Tian didn’t want others to witness his teachings.

“Zhou Xiong, I’ve never been so attentive toward my own disciples!” Luo Tian felt a pang of guilt, recalling his other disciples who had been left to their own devices.

“Hum…” Luo Tian then danced the longsword in his hand. As an Immortal King, he had cultivated sword techniques well; thus, he could demonstrate them. The blade transformed into a dragon, slicing through the air with icy glimmers. Finally, he unleashed three sword beams, each sending Zhou Yuanhao into trembling awe.

“Absolute Sword Techniques Three: it demands relentless advance, severing both one’s own path and the enemy’s!”

“Tomorrow’s duel is perilous. You may use these three techniques freely. Remember, survival is paramount!” Luo Tian addressed Zhou Yuanhao, who was still dazed.

“And this one—Burning Soul Seal. It directly annihilates an enemy’s soul!” Luo Tian added, then began explaining with his hands.

“Understood? Come on, attack me. Time is pressing; I can’t let you learn by yourself!” Luo Tian concluded his demonstration, addressing Zhou Yuanhao.

“Yes!” Zhou Yuanhao bowed respectfully before drawing his sword and attacking Luo Tian.

“Not me, but Chen Tianxiu or Zhou Li! Want revenge?” Luo Tian barked loudly. If Zhou Yuanhao made a mistake, he would correct it harshly, even donning the Thousand Mirage Mask to mimic Zhou Li’s form.

“Kill!” The cries of battle echoed as people outside the barrier watched two blurred figures clashing.

“Last-minute preparation, yet it’s effective. Zhou Xiong is guiding Zhou Yuanhao!”

“But will it help? Zhou Li is comparable to inner gate disciples. Even if Zhou Yuanhao is extraordinary, he can’t match Zhou Li’s group!” People murmured.

Night fell. Luo Tian continuously guided Zhou Li, while those outside the courtyard gradually dispersed.

No one noticed a speck of dust drifting into Luo Tian’s barrier, landing on his sleeve.

“Found it?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with light as he communicated with the Heaven-Refining Stone.

“Master, after so many days, I’ve only one place left to search: the Eternal Life Hall and the Eternal Immortal King’s residence. Your master’s soul must be there!”

“The Eternal Life Hall is surrounded by barriers; even I find it difficult to enter!” The Heaven-Refining Stone replied, causing Luo Tian’s brows to furrow.

“Eternal Life Hall!” Luo Tian muttered. From Zhou Xiong’s memories, he knew the Eternal Life Hall was the core of Eternal Life Mountain. Only the top eight strongest in Eternal Life Mountain could enter it, besides the Eternal Immortal King.

“Difficult. Very difficult!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. One was the Eternal Immortal King’s residence, and the other was the peak of Eternal Life Mountain. Entering either was like climbing to heaven!

“First, become an inner gate elder, then find a way into the Eternal Life Hall. If necessary, let Elder Longque force his way in!” Luo Tian mused, but time was running out.

Time passed. The next morning arrived. Zhou Yuanhao, exhausted yet exhilarated, stood before Luo Tian.

“Go refine the elixir. After recovery, avenge yourself! Today you must make a name!” Luo Tian smiled, dismissing the barrier and sending Zhou Yuanhao back into the elixir.

Chapter 2467: Rise ( )

The towering arena radiated radiant spiritual energy, yet its bloodstained surface marred the atmosphere with an eerie feel. Below stood countless outer gate disciples, eyes filled with anticipation as they gazed at the arena.

“When will it start?”

“No one has arrived yet!” People murmured, waiting for the contest to begin.

At last, seven outer gate elders emerged from the crowd, their gazes cold. Behind them followed their disciples.

“Respectful greetings to the elders!” Outer gate disciples bowed respectfully, acknowledging the seven men.

“Zhou Xiong hasn’t arrived? Is he too cowardly?” Luoxiu sneered. Though he had clashed with Luo Tian before and been repelled, it didn’t mean he feared him. Deep down, he still looked down on Zhou Xiong.

“Certainly intimidated by the elders’ authority!” Many disciples quickly flattered the elders.

“Wait. If he doesn’t come, we’ll deal with him too! What kind of person gets so many pills?” A half-step Immortal King elder spoke, his voice laced with envy.

Time passed slowly. Under the crowd’s anxious anticipation, Luo Tian and Zhou Yuanhao finally arrived.

“Truly dared to come! How inflated has Zhou Xiong become? Doesn’t he care about his disciple’s life?” The crowd roared, watching Luo Tian smiling as he approached.

“Good morning,” Luo Tian gazed at them without a care, then waved his hand. A chair materialized behind him, and he leaned back with his legs crossed.

“Stop stalling. Let’s begin!” The elders spoke coldly, eyeing Zhou Yuanhao.

“Since you’re so eager, Yuanhao will grant their wish. Go up and kill them!” Luo Tian addressed Zhou Yuanhao, who was still tense.

“Yes!” Zhou Yuanhao resolved not to disgrace his master. He leapt into the air and landed on the arena.

“Zhou Yuanhao, truly a late-stage True Immortal!” Many gasped in shock. They had heard of it but hadn’t believed it.

“Terrifying! I remember he was only early-stage True Immortal. How could he leap to late-stage so quickly? Though his cultivation seems unstable, it’s too astonishing!” People gasped.

“Who… who dares to die?” Zhou Yuanhao stood on the platform, his body trembling slightly as he stammered.

“Haha! Just you, a coward?” A loud laugh echoed. A figure stepped onto the arena—white robes flowing, eyes scanning Zhou Yuanhao. It was Li Xianzhao.

“Begin!” Li Xianzhao’s master, Su Tianyang, spoke. His gaze bore impatience; though Li Xianzhao had just ascended to late-stage True Immortal, he was confident.

“Hum…” The longsword hummed. Li Xianzhao wielded a verdant blade, gazing at Zhou Yuanhao.

“Kid, let me give you one move. Come on!” Li Xianzhao had never looked down on Zhou Yuanhao, except for the time he was bitten and couldn’t let go.

“I won’t disgrace my master!” Zhou Yuanhao’s heart roared. His aura surged, channeling his cultivation into the golden sword. With a roar, he swung it toward Li Xianzhao.

Golden sword beams rose, dazzling the crowd. The overwhelming power made people gasp in awe.

“J-just…” Li Xianzhao began to mock, but the golden beam struck him with lightning speed. His face contorted in shock.

Li Xianzhao hadn’t reacted in time, and the golden beam severed his body. A deep wound appeared on Li Xianzhao’s chest.

Li Xianzhao fell to the arena, a pool of blood beneath him.

“Idiot!” Luo Tian’s lips curled. Zhou Yuanhao had just entered late-stage True Immortal, but Li Xianzhao’s carelessness would cost him dearly.

“Kill!” Zhou Yuanhao recalled Luo Tian’s teachings, seizing the moment to strike. He leapt into the air and slashed downward at Li Xianzhao, who lay on the ground.

“Dare!” Seeing this, Li Xianzhao’s master couldn’t hold back. His face darkened as he flew toward the arena.

“Hum…” A black spear materialized before Li Xianzhao’s master, striking his chest and sending him flying.

“Cheating?” A weathered figure stood there, gazing at the flying Li Xianzhao’s master.

“Pf…” In that brief delay, Zhou Yuanhao’s sword struck Li Xianzhao again, splitting him in two.

“You…” Li Xianzhao’s master stared wide-eyed. The crowd fell silent, stunned by Zhou Yuanhao’s two strikes that had ended Li Xianzhao.

Zhou Yuanhao trembled, gazing at Li Xianzhao’s corpse. This was his first kill since joining Zhou Xiong.

“Trouble!” Luo Tian’s heart skipped a beat. He had anticipated everything but not Zhou Yuanhao’s bloodless hands.

“Yuanhao, stay calm. Everyone has their time to kill!” Luo Tian transmitted his voice to Zhou Yuanhao, urging him to stay composed.

Zhou Yuanhao’s two strikes had stunned the elders’ disciples, who understood Li Xianzhao’s strength.

“Li Xianzhao was too careless. He still saw Zhou Yuanhao as a weak target!” Zhou Li spoke, gazing at Zhou Yuanhao.

“I’ll go!” As soon as Zhou Li’s words finished, a figure rushed onto the arena toward Zhou Yuanhao.

“Fight back! Don’t you want to remain weak anymore?” Luo Tian’s voice thundered in Zhou Yuanhao’s mind.

“No, I won’t be weak again. Killing one is the same as killing two. If they don’t die, I will!” Zhou Yuanhao’s breaths were heavy, his eyes crimson. He faced the charging youth with a wild aura, swinging his sword toward him.

Clashes echoed. This time, Zhou Yuanhao clashed with the youth repeatedly, his body retreating step by step.

“This is about right. Zhou Yuanhao has just entered late-stage True Immortal; his cultivation is unstable!” People watched Zhou Yuanhao spitting blood, their faces filled with admiration.

“Absolute Sword Technique!” As Zhou Yuanhao was about to fall from the arena, he finally retaliated. Golden beams surged, striking the youth.

“No use!” The youth sneered, wielding a long knife and countering with his own technique. A thunderous sound cracked the sky. The youth halted his pursuit of Zhou Yuanhao.

“This is a high-level immortal technique!”

“Zhou Xiong must have obtained some extraordinary inheritance! Not only does he have pills, but also techniques!” People gasped, realizing Zhou Yuanhao’s technique was exceptional.

“Desperation!” As people marveled, Zhou Yuanhao struck again. The second form of Absolute Sword Technique activated, golden light flashing like the sun. Tremors shook the earth as this strike pressed down with overwhelming power, making the youth pale. A surge of potential erupted from him, and he launched a green knife beam with sky-piercing might toward Zhou Yuanhao’s strike.

The clash roared again. Both Zhou Yuanhao and the youth spat blood, their bodies flying backward before rising again.

“Absolute Heaven!” Zhou Yuanhao’s voice roared with madness. As soon as he stood, he unleashed the third form of the technique.

“Hum…” A thunderous sound erupted. The golden beam sliced through the sky, instantly striking the youth who had just risen.

“Pf…” Blood appeared in people’s sight. The youth was even more thoroughly destroyed than Li Xianzhao, splitting into blood mist.

“Vomit…” Zhou Yuanhao vomited blood but still stood trembling on the arena.

“Zhou Li, come fight!” A terrifying aura radiated from Zhou Yuanhao. Luo Tian nodded.

“Some changes, but I still need to eliminate Zhou Li for true transformation!” Luo Tian mused. This arena battle was beneath his notice; what he truly focused on was Zhou Yuanhao entering the inner gate, allowing him to enter as well. This battle was merely a test for Zhou Yuanhao’s strength, as his current might still fell short of the inner gate challenges.

People remained silent. Even the elders’ disciples no longer scoffed. If Zhou Yuanhao killing Li Xianzhao was luck, then defeating this youth was pure strength.

“Everything is tied to Zhou Xiong!” People gazed at Luo Tian, who sat again. They knew Zhou Xiong and his disciple would rise from today onward—especially Zhou Yuanhao, who had definitely made a name.

“Dare you?” Zhou Li’s eyes flashed coldness. He gazed at Zhou Yuanhao, leaping into the air and landing on the arena.

“Think you’ve won two battles? You’re not worthy to challenge me! I’ll show you despair!” Zhou Li sneered.

“Kill…” Zhou Yuanhao didn’t waste words. He felt he now had the right to fight Zhou Li.

Absolute Sword Technique Three surged, repeatedly striking.

“Probably killing this Zhou Li would make no one dare to challenge!” Luo Tian mused. He knew Zhou Yuanhao wasn’t yet Zhou Li’s match, but he had prepared for Zhou Yuanhao’s safety.

Chapter 2468: Fame in the Outer Gate

Clashes echoed. Zhou Li, an outer gate top disciple, still dominated Zhou Yuanhao despite his use of Absolute Heaven Three.

“Is that all your sword techniques? Not impressive!” Zhou Li danced his blade, mocking Zhou Yuanhao. He roared, his sword transforming into storms and countless rain-like beams, making Zhou Yuanhao suffer.

“Storms and Rainless Sword—Zhou Li’s signature technique!” People gasped, watching Zhou Li’s blade swirling, trapping Zhou Yuanhao in a storm.

Pf-pf-pf…

Blades repeatedly struck Zhou Yuanhao, turning him into a bloodied figure.

After the storm, Zhou Li stood with disdain, gazing at Zhou Yuanhao: “You’re still trash!”

“You’re the trash! Your whole family is trash!” Zhou Yuanhao’s eyes burned with fierce resentment. Zhou Li was like a demon in his mind; without eliminating him, Zhou Yuanhao would never escape the past.

“You wanted to see my other skills? I’ll show you!” Zhou Yuanhao coughed blood, speaking as he moved his hands.

“Burning Soul Seal!” A roaring sound erupted from Zhou Yuanhao’s front, a terrifying wave of power radiating outward.

“What technique is this?” Everyone was shocked. They felt the terror but didn’t know its form.

“Go…” Zhou Yuanhao pushed his hands forward, a ripple forming and flying out. Though slow, it instantly struck Zhou Li’s head.

“Beware! It’s a soul technique—directly attacking the soul!” Luoxiu shouted, warning Zhou Li.

“Soul technique?” Zhou Li’s eyes narrowed. He quickly gathered his soul to resist, while his hands moved, sending sword beams toward Zhou Yuanhao.

The beams pierced the ripple but couldn’t stop Zhou Yuanhao’s attack. In an instant, Zhou Li felt his mind struck by lightning.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed. Zhou Li fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth and screaming.

Pf-pf-pf… At the same time, sword beams pierced Zhou Yuanhao’s body. However, he avoided vital points, his eyes wild as he gazed at Zhou Li on the ground.

A sharp friction sound echoed. Zhou Yuanhao held his sword, its tip scraping the ground with sparks flying as he walked toward Zhou Li.

“Zhou Li, get up!” Luoxiu shouted, watching Zhou Li’s pain. He hoped Zhou Li would rise and kill Zhou Yuanhao.

Hundred feet… Ninety feet… Zhou Yuanhao walked slowly, his bloodstained footprints behind him. Clearly, he was severely wounded.

“You truly surprised me!” As Zhou Yuanhao approached within thirty feet of Zhou Li, Zhou Li trembled and rose from the ground. His face was pale as paper, his gaze weak.

“But this time, you still won’t defeat me!” Zhou Li stepped forward toward Zhou Yuanhao.

“End!” People watched Zhou Li’s charge, sighing inwardly. They knew this battle was over. Though Zhou Li was in poor condition, he looked better than Zhou Yuanhao, who seemed unable to move.

“Looks like I’ll need my master’s help!” Zhou Yuanhao gazed at Luo Tian, who had only blocked Su Tianyang and hadn’t moved otherwise.

Zhou Yuanhao waved his hand, two black spears flying from it into the void. In an instant, Zhou Li reached him—within ten feet—but that distance felt like a divine punishment. The two black spears instantly entered Zhou Li’s body, freezing him in place.

“Ah…” Zhou Li screamed, clutching his head. In people’s terrified gaze, he turned into a pool of black water.

Zhi-zhi… The black liquid didn’t dissipate but corroded the Eternal Life Arena, raising a cloud of white smoke. A black mark remained in people’s sight.

Within one breath, Zhou Li vanished. The air fell silent again. Two needles dropped to the ground with a crisp sound, unusually clear.

“What happened?” Everyone was stunned, gazing at Zhou Yuanhao as if he were a monster.

“Poison! It’s poison!” Luoxiu gasped, gazing at Luo Tian with anger.

“Zhou Xiong! You used poison—despicable!” Luoxiu shouted, but didn’t erupt. He had felt danger at the moment Zhou Yuanhao threw the poison needles.

“Too terrifying! What kind of poison is this? It eliminated a late-stage True Immortal in less than one breath!” People’s faces showed fear, their skin prickling.

Zhou Yuanhao used poison needles—Luo Tian’s gift. Even an Immortal King would suffer, let alone a mere late-stage True Immortal.

“Roar…” Zhou Yuanhao roared into the sky, releasing his pent-up frustration. For years, he and his master had endured humiliation. Now, for the first time, he felt triumphant, his aura changing completely.

“Who… who dares to die?” Zhou Yuanhao swayed but still gazed at the elders’ disciples.

Silence. The elders’ disciples fell silent, recalling Zhou Li’s death—too terrifying.

“His poison must be limited. Now he’s severely wounded; maybe we can win by gambling!” The remaining five disciples gazed at Zhou Yuanhao, who seemed barely alive.

“Let’s gamble…” The next moment, a late-stage True Immortal youth leapt into the air, becoming a streak of light toward Zhou Yuanhao.

“Hum…” But as soon as Zhou Yuanhao raised his hand, people despaired. They knew this youth would also meet misfortune.

The youth was nervous. Seeing Zhou Yuanhao raise his hand, he felt a twitch in his heart and tried to dodge but couldn’t react.

Another scream echoed. A pool of black liquid corroded the arena, drying out and making people shudder.

“Still… any?” Zhou Yuanhao gazed at the remaining ones, smiling with a chilling effect.

“His ambition has awakened!” Luo Tian watched Zhou Yuanhao’s state, sighing deeply. From a timid person to one feared by others—this feeling could be addictive. If not handled properly, Zhou Yuanhao might take a wrong path in the future.

No one dared to challenge Zhou Yuanhao now. It was too terrifying—kill with a wave of hands. Who knew how many poison needles he had left? Even the elders dared not speak, fearing those needles.

“We’re leaving!” The elders could only endure, finally grumbling a sentence before leaving the Eternal Life Arena.

“Everyone, did you forget something?” Luo Tian stopped them, spreading his hands.

“Right! The bet—no one challenged, so you lost. Give me the wager!” Luo Tian sneered, gazing at Luoxiu and others.

“You…” Luoxiu’s face showed anger. If Zhou Yuanhao had poison needles, Luo Tian surely had them too.

“Here!” The seven men endured their humiliation and handed over treasures equivalent to six-star immortal pills to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt a bit disgusted but took the resources anyway. Even a fly’s leg was meat.

After collecting everything, Luo Tian retrieved Zhou Yuanhao and walked back to his courtyard.

Under people’s reverent gazes, Luo Tian returned to his courtyard. Along with him came many outer gate disciples.

“Master! I’ve chosen you as my master for life. No one can take you from me!” A chorus of shouts echoed outside Luo Tian’s courtyard.

Too strong—within an instant, Zhou Yuanhao had single-handedly fought eight of the outer gate’s top disciples. Ten days—from early-stage True Immortal to late-stage, now the outer gate’s top disciple. No matter what methods, he had killed Zhou Li and Li Xianzhao. His growth was a miracle.

All knew this was due to Zhou Yuanhao’s master, Zhou Xiong.

Zhou Xiong’s courtyard was surrounded by disciples, all eager to be his students. In their eyes, Zhou Xiong’s inheritance was surely world-shaking.

Luo Tian ignored them and tended to Zhou Yuanhao, helping him recover quickly.

“Yuanhao, keep your mindset steady. All this must be self-adjusted. Recover well; tomorrow we’ll go to the inner gate!” Luo Tian addressed Zhou Yuanhao, who nodded heavily.

“No matter what I become in the future, you are my master! I’ll face fire and water, kill all your enemies for you!” Seeing Luo Tian leave, Zhou Yuanhao whispered.

Luo Tian walked back to his room and sat cross-legged on the bed, pondering his next plan.

“The inner gate shouldn’t be a problem. The hardest part is entering the Eternal Life Hall. Once I find my master’s soul, I can do anything!” Luo Tian mused.

“Treasures—world-shaking treasures. They’ll surely move those eight men. I’ll have a chance to enter the Eternal Life Hall!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, thinking about treasures he could hide.

“Heaven-Refining Stone…” Finally, Luo Tian turned his thoughts to the Heaven-Refining Stone. Longque was also an option, but Luo Tian feared Longque might become violent and burn himself.

Chapter 2469: Eternal Life Tower

Morning arrived. Luo Tian stood up slowly, gazing at the sea of people around his courtyard, his lips twitching.

The door opened. Zhou Yuanhao emerged from his room, energetic and respectful toward Luo Tian.

“Master!” Zhou Yuanhao bowed respectfully, as always.

“Good. Today you apply for inner gate disciple status. I’ll apply for inner gate elder. We won’t stay here anymore!” Luo Tian addressed Zhou Yuanhao, leading him out of the courtyard.

Through the crowd, they walked along a wide mountain path. The deeper they went into the inner gate, the denser the spiritual energy became. Closer to the inner gate’s mountain peaks lived those with higher status in the outer gate.

“Zhou Xiong!” A figure stood in a courtyard, Su Tianyang gazing at Luo Tian and Zhou Yuanhao passing by his courtyard.

“Inner gate. Zhou Xiong wants to enter the inner gate!” At the same time, other outer gate elders received news that Luo Tian was heading toward the inner gate. They immediately realized his intention.

“Want to enter the inner gate? Dream on!” Almost instantly, several elders gritted their teeth.

Luo Tian continued toward the inner gate. To his surprise, the closest courtyard wasn’t Luoxiu’s.

“Shen Lingyuan!” But then he saw a stocky figure standing in the courtyard. His fat body lay like mud on a chair, with several young male disciples serving him. These disciples were thin and lifeless, obviously drained of vitality.

“Zhou Xiong!” Shen Lingyuan stood up abruptly, gazing at Luo Tian with hatred.

“Did you ask my opinion before entering the inner gate?”

“You’ll return to me eventually!” Shen Lingyuan’s face showed disdain, then she lay back down, caressing a lifeless youth beside her.

Luo Tian felt a chill. He quickly led Zhou Yuanhao past Shen Lingyuan’s courtyard, feeling pity for those young disciples.

After an hour of walking, Luo Tian and Zhou Yuanhao reached the inner gate’s mountain peak. Luo Tian had visited the inner gate several times before, so he was familiar with it.

Compared to the outer gate’s commotion, inner gate disciples regarded Zhou Yuanhao and Luo Tian with more composure. They were merely curious.

They soon arrived at a grand hall, stepping inside. The hall was bustling with people of all ages.

“Excuse me, my disciple and I wish to take the inner gate entrance exam!” Luo Tian addressed a relatively free disciple.

“Fine. Prepare yourself. Once enough people are gathered, I’ll inform the hall master!” The disciple didn’t take it seriously. So many people wanted to enter the inner gate that he handed Luo Tian and Zhou Yuanhao each a token.

Luo Tian and Zhou Yuanhao found a seat, waiting for someone to call them. However, they waited half an hour—those who arrived after them were called first, but no one came to call Luo Tian.

“Zhou Yuanhao, come in!” A disciple in green robes emerged and shouted at the crowd.

“Go on. Remember, survival is paramount!” Luo Tian advised, gazing at the disciple from Eternal Life Mountain.

Zhou Yuanhao left. Luo Tian was stuck waiting again, but no one called his name. Instead, several people arrived.

“Zhou Xiong! I didn’t expect you to sneak here to enter the inner gate. Very low-key!” A playful voice echoed. Luoxiu and Su Tianyang, seven men with smiles, entered the hall.

“What did you do?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed. He felt a bad omen but didn’t care; in front of absolute strength, their schemes were nothing.

“Nothing. We’re also taking the inner gate elder exam!” Luoxiu smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Stop me from entering the inner gate?” Luo Tian immediately understood. These men were trying to block him.

Eternal Life Mountain had its rules. If the exam failed, one couldn’t enter the inner gate for a hundred years.

“Zhou Xiong! Luoxiu! Su Tianyang…” As Luo Tian realized, a disciple emerged from the back door and addressed them.

“I’ll see what tricks you can pull!” Luo Tian smiled, following the disciple. The others also wore smirks.

The eight outer gate elders choosing to advance into the inner gate immediately drew people’s attention.

“Eight elders choosing to enter the inner gate. Can they succeed?”

“Luoxiu has stayed in the outer gate long enough. He must be tired. His strength could easily enter the inner gate. Unfortunately, his disciple Zhou Li died; otherwise, with Zhou Li’s help, Luoxiu’s position would be more secure!” People murmured.

Luo Tian and the eight men entered the back hall. Two elders sat there, their auras radiating strong power—early-stage Immortal King.

The hall also had several True Immortals. Seeing Luo Tian and the eight men, their faces changed slightly.

“Eight elders entering the inner gate. Do we still have a chance?” A dozen True Immortal peaks immediately felt discontent.

“Senior Shen, Senior Lu Zhang. These eight have arrived!” The guide disciple bowed and spoke before leaving the hall.

“You are Zhou Xiong? I heard you’ve been making a name recently. Good!” The elder named Shen smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“This old man didn’t plan well,” Luo Tian felt ill intent in his gaze.

“An early-stage Immortal King trying to scheme against me?” Luo Tian felt disdain. If he showed his true strength, these people would be defeated in less than three breaths.

“Enough talk. This exam allows two to enter the inner gate!” Elder Shen spoke, then waved his hand. A small green tower materialized in front of Luo Tian and the others.

The tower expanded, standing tall in the hall. People’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“This is the Eternal Life Tower—one of the three top-tier immortal artifacts in Eternal Life Mountain!” Luoxiu spoke, his eyes greedy.

“Three days. Who obtains two Break-Heaven Seals inside will become an inner gate elder!” Elder Lu spoke.

“Go ahead!” The two elders finished speaking and ignored Luo Tian’s group.

“Go…” Almost immediately, True Immortal peaks rushed into the tower. In their eyes, this was their only chance.

“An artifact of top-tier immortal quality—no world treasures. That’s manageable!” Luo Tian felt relieved, thinking the top-tier artifact posed no threat to him.
