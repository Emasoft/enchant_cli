Chapter 518: Qionghua Palace

“Crack…” Under the stunned gazes of the onlookers, the maidservant in the late stage of Bone-Destroying Cultivation arrived swiftly and departed just as quickly. Before her feet could even touch Luo Tian’s body, her legs twisted violently, and she was sent flying backward, colliding with the earth dragon.

The onlookers were utterly stunned by this sudden spectacle, their faces etched with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian, whose expression remained calm.

The man guarding the transmission array also dropped his jaw in shock, his mouth falling open as the storage pouch Luo Tian had given him slipped from his grasp and clattered onto the table.

Among them, he was closest to Luo Tian. At the very moment the maidservant had nearly kicked Luo Tian, the middle-aged man felt as though he stood on the precipice of death, a chilling aura making it difficult for him to breathe.

“You!” The maidservant’s face contorted with fury as she pulled herself up from the earth dragon, her pale complexion betraying the pain in her legs.

“Ai Xue, return!” A soft female voice echoed from within the carriage, its tone as pure and refreshing as mountain spring water.

“Kid, you’re in trouble!” The maidservant sneered at Luo Tian before turning her gaze to the woman who had just stepped down from the carriage, her expression one of reverence.

“May I enter?” Luo Tian ignored the maidservant’s threat, tapping the table lightly once more. The man snapped back to his senses.

“Uh…” The man regained his composure, his face etched with respect. Luo Tian’s presence had left an indelible impression on him, and he knew neither side was someone he could afford to offend. His face twisted with unease; for a moment, he didn’t know how to respond.

Logically, Luo Tian had arrived first and should have been granted entry. Yet the woman who descended from the carriage was clearly no ordinary figure, and he dared not agree hastily. If he let Luo Tian in, the maidservant’s arrogance would surely result in dire consequences for him.

In the middle-aged man’s momentary hesitation, a faint fragrance spread through the air.

As the scent wafted around them, the woman in the carriage stepped out, causing a collective gasp among the onlookers.

“This…” Their minds went silent, their faces etched with astonishment.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly as he turned his gaze to the woman, his entire being darkening.

Before him strode a tall woman, her presence exuding an intangible fragrance that intoxicated the senses. Her physique was flawless—save for one fatal flaw: her face. A round face marred by countless stars-like pimples, and a small black mole on her forehead, complete with a thick black hair sprouting from it.

“This…!” The crowd muttered in disbelief, expecting a beauty of the first rank but instead encountering an abominable woman.

Luo Tian’s lips twitched, surprised that the woman inside was so unattractive. Yet his brows furrowed again as he sensed a dangerous aura radiating from her.

“Esteemed elder, I am Jiang Le Rong, the younger master of Qionghua Palace in the Southern Region. I humbly request your kindness to let me pass first; I shall be eternally grateful!” The woman ignored the onlookers’ astonished glances, her eyes gleaming with intensity.

“Qionghua Palace?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly, his mind reeling.

Though the name Qionghua Palace was somewhat unfamiliar to him, he had studied the Southern Region’s power structures after deciding to enter it. He had heard from Tian Bo and Lu Kunpeng about the region’s major sects, including Qionghua Palace. Among those mentioned as forces to be wary of was this very sect.

Qionghua Palace ranked among the top-tier sects in the Southern Region, even rivaling the Yeluo Sect. The Southern Region had no concept of first or second-tier sects; its vastness—nearly half the Tianyuan Continent—made it a land of countless sects and families.

The saying “Families abound, sects dominate; Soul Essences are as common as dogs, and魂魄 (Soul Fragments) litter the ground” encapsulated its reality. Though exaggerated, it highlighted the region’s overwhelming number of sects and people.

To establish a sect or family in the Southern Region was no small feat, for founding one would inevitably draw the ire of existing sects.

That Qionghua Palace had risen to prominence in this region meant its strength was terrifying. The woman before him, though unattractive, was certainly no pushover. Luo Tian sighed inwardly, cursing his misfortune—before even entering the Southern Region, he had already antagonized a formidable figure.

“Qionghua Palace!” The onlookers, who had previously mocked the woman’s appearance, now fell silent, their faces filled with reverence.

Those using the transmission array were seasoned travelers between regions and knew of Qionghua Palace’s reputation. They hadn’t expected this woman to be the sect’s younger master, a title that equated to a second-tier sect’s head in the Northern Region.

Their gazes shifted toward Luo Tian, curious to see how he would resolve this situation.

The answer was a resounding no. Luo Tian had never feared anyone; if he were intimidated by her status, he wouldn’t be the Luo Tian they knew.

“My apologies, but I have urgent matters. This spot cannot be yielded,” Luo Tian said softly, his expression unchanging.

“Hum…” A cold aura formed around him, an invisible wave radiating from Jiang Le Rong’s presence. The onlookers trembled in fear, their legs shaking uncontrollably.

Luo Tian’s inner voice sneered, “Soul Essence in the mid-stage?” He remained unshaken, shielding the transmission array’s guard. After all, he needed this man to activate the array.

Seeing Luo Tian unharmed, Jiang Le Rong was briefly surprised before a light smile graced her lips. “Then I shall not disturb your passage. Might I inquire for your name? Upon arriving in the Southern Region, do visit Qionghua Palace. I shall personally welcome you!”

The onlookers’ hearts jolted as they gazed at the man disguised as a middle-aged man. Their eyes carried pity, for they believed Luo Tian had now caught the younger master’s attention.

Chapter 519: Arrival in the Southern Region

As everyone expected Luo Tian to retreat meekly, they were stunned by his next words.

“Ha! I am nameless and faceless. I’ve heard Qionghua Palace is filled with beauties. Once I arrive in the Southern Region, if I have time, I’ll certainly pay my respects!” Luo Tian clasped his fists, stepping into the transmission array under the stunned gazes of the crowd.

Seeing Luo Tian enter the array, Jiang Le Rong’s expression darkened, her gaze lingering on him with a glint of malice.

Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smile, his eyes meeting Jiang Le Rong’s without fear. His gaze held the flicker of thunder.

“Wish you a smooth journey!” Jiang Le Rong smiled, waving to Luo Tian. As she waved, the fragrance in the air grew denser.

“Begin it!” Luo Tian urged the dazed man, signaling him to activate the array.

The man snapped out of his trance, glancing at Jiang Le Rong before tossing a pill into the maidservant’s mouth. He then ascended onto the dragon carriage, showing no further intent to clash.

“Begin…” The man barked at his companions.

As he spoke, five array flags fell to the ground simultaneously, activating the transmission array leading to the Southern Region.

“Hum…” A powerful surge rippled through the flags, and Luo Tian’s hundred companions vanished from sight.

The onlookers sighed as they watched them disappear, expecting a spectacle but ending with an anticlimactic resolution. They gazed at the dragon carriage in confusion, wondering why Qionghua Palace’s younger master had shown such restraint.

Jiang Le Rong, however, remained unfazed, returning to her carriage while the maidservant sneered and followed suit.

…

“Hum…” A surge of spiritual energy rippled as Luo Tian and the others emerged on the Southern Region’s ground.

Luo Tian exhaled in awe, standing upon the land of the Southern Region and feeling its dense spiritual energy. He marveled at how it surpassed the Northern Region by an immeasurable degree, even outshining the Kunlun Mountains of the Eastern Region.

Born in the Northern Region and having visited the Eastern, this was Luo Tian’s first time in the Southern. Upon landing, he immediately sensed its superiority over both regions.

“Jinyu City!” Luo Tian marveled, observing the bustling crowd around him before being prompted by the guards to exit the array.

The hundred others who had traveled with Luo Tian bore expressions of reverence toward him, having witnessed the entire clash between Luo Tian and Jiang Le Rong. His strength and demeanor had earned their admiration.

As they stepped off the array, a middle-aged man approached, smiling: “Brother, may I know your name?”

“Uh…” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, studying the man’s appearance.

Dressed in a deep blue robe, the middle-aged man’s eyes gleamed with cunning—clearly a shrewd individual.

“I’m sorry, but I can’t reveal it,” Luo Tian declined, unwilling to engage in petty games. His expression darkened slightly as he walked away.

The man, seeing Luo Tian’s coldness, slapped his forehead in realization. He had been careless; Luo Tian’s clash with Qionghua Palace’s younger master indicated he wished to remain anonymous. It was foolish of him to inquire about his name.

The man ignored Luo Tian’s coldness, flashing a habitual smile and chasing after him.

“Brother, wait! Allow me to say one thing!” The middle-aged man hurried to Luo Tian’s side.

Luo Tian moved at a steady pace, and the middle-aged man—also of the Cultivation Body stage—found it easy to catch up.

Seeing the man had caught him, Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly, his expression unamused as he turned to face the man.

“Let me introduce myself first,” the middle-aged man began, “I am Li Xingfa, a merchant. I assume this is your first time in the Southern Region?”

“Get to the point!” Luo Tian waved dismissively, interrupting Li Xingfa’s chatter.

Unperturbed by the interruption, Li Xingfa adjusted his expression: “I’d like to hire you to escort something for me.”

“No interest…” Luo Tian sneered, continuing forward.

Bodyguard work? He had never done it before. As a Soul Essence-stage cultivator, the younger master of Yuying Sect in the Eastern Region and a prodigy of Wuxing Gate’s Dan Pavilion, he would be ridiculed if he took such a mundane job.

Seeing Luo Tian quicken his pace, Li Xingfa’s face finally showed anxiety, clinging to him like a stubborn plaster.

“Brother… my price is absolutely high—ten million spiritual stones!” Li Xingfa darted in front of Luo Tian, revealing his offer.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with interest. He hadn’t expected a common merchant, only at the Cultivation Body stage seven, to be so wealthy.

Seeing Luo Tian’s expression, Li Xingfa smiled confidently. He knew his offer was already impressive to most—ten million spiritual stones, enough to tempt even a Soul Essence-stage mid-level cultivator.

“Don’t you fear I’ll kill you and take your spiritual stones?” Luo Tian smirked, gazing at Li Xingfa.

“Not at all!” Li Xingfa affirmed more confidently, sensing Luo Tian’s interest in the ten million spiritual stones.

Luo Tian had never met such an intriguing person before; his interest deepened, not for the ten million spiritual stones but for Li Xingfa himself.

Ten million spiritual stones were trivial to Luo Tian, though he had been poor since returning from the Eastern Region. Before leaving, Zhang Ziping had given him a hundred million spiritual stones as travel money. Plus, he remembered how many people in the Southern Region owed him debts.

“I don’t have it yet; I’ll get it once I arrive!” Li Xingfa shrugged.

“Hmph… no interest,” Luo Tian sneered, striding toward Jinyu City’s gate.

“Ah… brother, don’t go! Let me explain—once we reach Binge Island, the ten million spiritual stones will be yours in full!” Li Xingfa didn’t give up, chasing after Luo Tian.

“Where?” Luo Tian halted, his gaze sharp at Li Xingfa.

Li Xingfa was still chasing him when Luo Tian suddenly stopped, causing Li Xingfa to crash into him.

“Oof…” Li Xingfa fell to the ground, feeling as if he’d collided with an iron wall, his head ringing.

Chapter 520: This Mountain Is Mine!

Li Xingfa shook his head, regaining composure. Seeing Luo Tian’s interest return, he quickly approached him again.

“Brother, if you escort me to Binge Island, I guarantee the ten million spiritual stones will be yours!” Li Xingfa patted his shoulder, confidence radiating from him.

“Tell me what you’re doing at Binge Island! That’s a forbidden zone, right? Are you trying to get me killed?” Luo Tian glared at Li Xingfa.

At the sight of Luo Tian’s glare, Li Xingfa immediately felt short of breath, his face pale with fear as he stammered: “I have something to sell at Binge Island. It’s worth twenty million spiritual stones! I’m afraid of mishaps on the way, so I asked you to escort me partway!”

“What is it?” Luo Tian’s expression remained unchanged as he asked.

“I was going to keep it secret, but seeing your darkening face…” Li Xingfa hesitated before continuing.

“It’s a message from an elder. If I deliver it to Binge Island, I’ll receive twenty million spiritual stones!” Li Xingfa spoke hurriedly as Luo Tian’s expression darkened further.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected to meet someone heading to Binge Island by chance.

“This is fate!” Luo Tian mused, deciding to help Li Xingfa on the way.

“This is the message the elder wanted me to deliver!” Li Xingfa, seeing Luo Tian’s silence, inwardly regretted asking for his protection. He had angered the man now, sighing silently—his intelligence had failed him. How could he expect a person who disregarded Qionghua Palace’s younger master to help a worm like himself for ten million spiritual stones?

Luo Tian didn’t even glance at the jade slip in Li Xingfa’s hand, shaking his head lightly: “Let’s go. I’m heading that way anyway.”

“Ah?” Li Xingfa was stunned, his face lighting up. In an instant, he saw Luo Tian walking toward the city gate.

“Ha! I’m truly brilliant!” Li Xingfa slapped his head, laughing as he followed Luo Tian.

As they exited the city gate, Li Xingfa floated into the air, his face filled with shock. In an instant, he was high above ten thousand feet, the wind howling in his ears.

“Guide me!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in Li Xingfa’s ear, snapping him back to reality.

“Soul Essence stage, dual-element!” Li Xingfa marveled as he saw Luo Tian’s wings. Though he had known Luo Tian was exceptional, he hadn’t expected him to be a dual-element Soul Essence.

Luo Tian’s golden and green wings fluttered slightly, carrying Li Xingfa as a streak of light toward the south.

It wasn’t that Luo Tian didn’t want to use his full power; seven elements would be too eye-catching. To avoid unnecessary trouble, he chose to remain low-key, using only two elements.

Binge Island lay at the southernmost tip of the Southern Region, while Jinyu City was in the northern part. The two were separated by countless mountains and rivers, requiring passage through numerous sects and perilous regions.

Luo Tian soared in the sky, observing the landscape below. As they passed a sect, he felt an eerie presence scanning him—only to retreat after confirming no hostility.

“The Southern Region is truly formidable!” Luo Tian mused, a sense of pressure settling on him. Binge Island was renowned in the Southern Region; he wondered if his journey would be smooth.

Yet Luo Tian had his own ace—his parents were guarding a seal deep within Binge Island. Once he arrived, they would surely sense it. He even suspected that his parents had already sensed his arrival in the Southern Region.

Luo Tian didn’t know that wherever he was on the Tianyuan Continent, his parents could sense him. This was the ability of a Soul-Union stage cultivator—once they left a mark on someone, Soul-Union masters could sense if that person was in danger.

This very ability had allowed Luo Nan to block an attack from the Yeluo Sect’s elder when Luo Tian killed Wang Siyuan.

One day… two days…

Luo Tian flew for seven days, finally sensing a chill in the air. His heart lit up with joy.

“Luo brother, after passing through the ancient stone forest, I estimate your speed will get us to Binge Island within two days!” Li Xingfa said, his face respectful.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian nodded slightly, waiting for Li Xingfa to rest. After all, Li Xingfa was only at the Cultivation Body stage seven; prolonged flight had left him exhausted.

“I’m ready!” Li Xingfa’s eyes sparkled with excitement, addressing Luo Tian.

Without a word, Luo Tian grabbed Li Xingfa and soared into the sky again. Below him stretched an endless forest of stone, its vastness making it impossible to see the horizon even from ten thousand feet.

Luo Tian focused, flying southward with determination to traverse the stone forest in one go.

But just as he and Li Xingfa had flown for an hour, a faint sound of breaking air reached Luo Tian’s ears.

In the next moment, a golden arrow shot down from above, directly aimed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his expression turning serious. He activated the “Sky-Blocking Step,” vanishing from his spot and appearing a hundred feet away.

“Yaya… this mountain is mine, this tree I pluck… to… to pass through… uh… what’s the next line? Brother?” A thickset man appeared before Luo Tian, accompanied by a youth with an amused expression.

“Smack… you idiot, you don’t even know this! How will I bring you out to make a name?” The youth slapped the thickset man’s head, scolding him loudly.

Chapter 521: Odd Brothers

“Brother, why do you hit me again? You always call me stupid!” The thickset man frowned at the youth, shouting but not acting aggressively.

“Hey! You’re rebelling? Want to eat good food tonight or not? Want to be full?” The youth smacked the thickset man’s head again, scolding him.

“Yeah, yeah!” Hearing the mention of good food, the thickset man drooled instantly, his face greedy.

The youth seemed to have found a way to teach the thickset man, ignoring Luo Tian as he continued lecturing him. Each word was related to food.

The thickset man nodded absentmindedly, drooling at every item the youth mentioned.

Luo Tian and Li Xingfa’s lips twitched as they watched these peculiar individuals, bewildered by their purpose. Why were they robbing so unprofessionally?

“Ahem… excuse me, two of you—what are you doing?” Luo Tian coughed lightly, interrupting the youth.

“You shut up! We’re brothers; what are you butting in for?” The youth turned, shouting at Luo Tian. But before he could finish his sentence, he slapped his head.

“Oops… I was so caught up in the fun that I forgot! Zhan Biao, beat him! After beating him, we’ll have enough to eat tonight!” The youth shouted at the thickset man.

“Good food!” Upon hearing “good food,” the thickset man turned green, roaring toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed; this thickset man felt like a beast in human form, pressing him with immense pressure. What surprised Luo Tian was that the man had no spiritual energy fluctuations at all.

The thickset man reached Luo Tian, throwing a simple punch that made Li Xingfa nearly wet his pants. He tried to dodge but found himself unable to move.

Luo Tian instantly pulled Li Xingfa into his storage pouch, then channeled his dual-element spiritual energy into his fists, striking the thickset man’s punch.

“Idiot…” The youth watched Luo Tian clash with his brother, sneering.

“Pound!” The two fists collided, emitting a crisp sound. Invisible waves spread from their punches.

“Hiss…” Luo Tian’s face showed shock upon contact, then he was sent flying over a thousand feet.

“Hmm… this one’s tough,” the thickset man said, smiling as if he had found a new toy. He charged toward Luo Tian again.

“Strong body!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, sensing the thickset man’s strength.

That punch had felt like striking an iron plate. Luo Tian was confident in his body, but he hadn’t expected that even with two spiritual elements enhancing his fists, he was still sent flying. He couldn’t imagine how strong this man’s body truly was.

Seeing the thickset man charge again, Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with discomfort. He channeled his three-element spiritual energy into his fists, striking the thickset man again.

Another thunderous sound echoed, but Luo Tian was sent flying once more, this time with blood spitting from his mouth.

“Hmm… three-element body?” The youth’s brows furrowed slightly, surprise in his eyes.

“Again!” Luo Tian roared, switching to four elements and charging forward.

The youth’s face showed surprise as Luo Tian transformed into four elements.

Four-element bodies were rare in the Southern Region, considered monstrous. The youth felt a slight worry: “Zhan Biao, be careful; this kid’s strange!”

But soon after, the youth sneered. He knew his brother hadn’t heard a word he said and was now charging like an enraged bull toward Luo Tian.

“Pound!” Another thunderous sound, and Luo Tian was sent flying again, blood spitting from his mouth. His face finally showed shock.

The thickset man didn’t stay still but retreated two steps in the sky.

“Five-element… six-element… seven-element!” Luo Tian’s power surged, finally revealing all his elements.

As the seven elements poured out, Luo Tian returned to his peak state, finally matching the thickset man’s strength. No longer was he sent flying but now evenly matched.

“Seven-element body!” The youth’s face showed shock. Seven-element bodies were unheard of in years; he had only heard about five-element prodigies from the Northern Region.

The thickset man, however, grew more excited with each clash. He loved close combat and had no spiritual elements in his body at all.

“Never seen someone match Zhan Biao in close combat! Truly a seven-element prodigy!” The youth mused, feeling this robbery target was becoming problematic.

His brother’s name was Chen Zhanbiao, a man with immense strength from birth. Within days of his birth, he had grown to the size of a three or four-year-old child. His strength was astonishing, even surpassing most adults.

As years passed, Chen Zhanbiao’s strength grew further, making it impossible for most warriors to fight him. This abnormality caused the village’s people to fear him, calling him a monster and driving him out.

Chen Zhanbiao’s mind was simple, but his appetite was insatiable—like a bottomless pit. No one could afford to feed him, until the youth met him and saved him from starvation.

These years, they had relied on each other, drifting endlessly until they took up robbery. They only robbed and didn’t kill; their targets were cultivators, living freely. Their bond was stronger than brothers.

Now seeing someone who could match Chen Zhanbiao, the youth felt uneasy and took a few hundred feet forward to prepare for rescue.

Chapter 522: First Battle in the Southern Region

The thunderous sound of their punches echoed as Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao clashed like two beasts, each punch striking the other. They fought from sky to ground, with stone forests collapsing under their blows.

Chen Zhanbiao grew more excited with each punch, roaring as if every cell in his body was activated. His arms swelled slightly, and he continued to strike relentlessly, as if entering a trance.

“Damn… unity of heaven and man!” Luo Tian noticed the thickset man’s change, realizing he had entered a state of unity with heaven and man.

The secret technique of the Shuiyuan Sect, Luo Tian hadn’t expected this thickset man to enter such a state while fighting.

Luo Tian, while defending Chen Zhanbiao’s attacks, mused that if Chen Zhanbiao had not entered unity with heaven and man, he might have stood a chance. But now, his close combat was no match for the thickset man.

Thinking this, Luo Tian retreated, using the “Sky-Blocking Step” to vanish into the sky. His hands moved swiftly, forming a soul-seizing seal in two breaths.

“Zhan Biao, be careful!” The youth shouted as Luo Tian used his technique.

But Chen Zhanbiao, in the state of unity with heaven and man, couldn’t hear the youth’s warning. Even if he did, he wouldn’t sense Luo Tian’s spiritual fluctuations.

Chen Zhanbiao followed closely, appearing before Luo Tian. At this moment, the soul-seizing seal was just formed and pushed toward Chen Zhanbiao’s head.

“Awaken!” Luo Tian sneered, and the soul-seizing seal collided with Chen Zhanbiao’s head.

“Pound!” The invisible soul-seizing seal penetrated Chen Zhanbiao’s powerful body, striking his soul.

“Roar!” The pain on his soul made Chen Zhanbiao instantly awaken, roaring into the sky.

But soon after, Luo Tian was stunned—his spiritual awareness had reached the peak of Soul Essence (Cultivation Body), and his soul-seizing seal could harm even a Soul Essence peak cultivator.

Yet this seal had only made Chen Zhanbiao awaken and feel slight pain.

“I thought I was the monster, but today I met one even more monstrous!” Luo Tian grimaced, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao’s wide grin.

“You’re good; I like you!” Chen Zhanbiao patted his head, grinning at Luo Tian.

“But if I don’t knock you down, my brother and I will starve tonight!” Chen Zhanbiao didn’t wait for Luo Tian’s reply, turning his gaze to the youth standing nearby.

“Return, Zhan Biao! Today we don’t fight!” The youth’s lips curled slightly as he spoke.

Today, the youth had witnessed a变态 (abnormality). He had thought his brother was already abnormal enough, but today he met someone even more so. Just with his body strength, this person could match Chen Zhanbiao—what would he be capable of if he used his techniques?

“Friend, this is my brother Chen Zhanbiao. I am Xu Liziyi! We apologize for the disturbance earlier!” The youth clasped his fists.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, surprised at the brothers’ names.

Chen Zhanbiao truly lived up to his name—aggressive and fierce. As for Xu Liziyi, this was the first time Luo Tian had heard such a name. From how Xu Liziyi scolded Chen Zhanbiao, he wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

“Two of you, we have no grudge. Why did you block my path?” Luo Tian’s face showed displeasure.

Luo Tian had sensed that Chen Zhanbiao hadn’t intended to kill him from the start. If he had used his full strength in the first punch, Luo Tian would have been injured with only two elements.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Xu Liziyi perked up: “Brother Luo, you’re mistaken. A man should rob the rich and help the poor. Besides, we’ve never killed a good person; whatever we steal is given to ordinary poor people. What’s wrong with that?”

Xu Liziyi said this, then straightened his chest proudly, as if he were the only good person in the world. Chen Zhanbiao smiled foolishly, patting his mountain-like body.

Hearing Xu Liziyi’s noble speech, Luo Tian’s lips twitched slightly. He found it amusing how Xu Liziyi framed robbery as noble, as if the world’s people were all villains except him.

But Luo Tian actually found himself liking the brothers’ quirky personalities and said: “Your virtue is admirable, Brother Luo. Let’s find a place to eat and talk further.”

“Food!” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes sparkled, drooling uncontrollably as he looked forward with anticipation.

“Will it be enough?” Chen Zhanbiao asked instinctively.

“Smack!” Xu Liziyi slapped Chen Zhanbiao’s head, stopping his drooling.

“Zhan Biao, what are you saying? We met Brother Luo and he invited us to eat. How could it not be enough! Right, Brother Luo?” Xu Liziye smiled at Luo Tian.

“Of course!” Luo Tian didn’t mind; he knew Chen Zhanbiao’s appetite was huge, but he carried a hundred million spiritual stones—enough for Chen Zhanbiao to eat one meal.

“Ah… Brother Luo, you’re a good person! My brother has only let me eat enough once!” Chen Zhanbiao smiled foolishly, patting Luo Tian’s shoulder. The touch made Luo Tian’s shoulder ache.

Luo Tian waved his hand, releasing Li Xingfa from the storage pouch—there was no longer any danger. He couldn’t let Li Xingfa stay in the storage pouch for too long.
