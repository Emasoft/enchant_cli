Jiang Huantian had only just received Xuan Dan today. He was too afraid to use the transmission array of the Three Days of Huantian, fearing another accident. Thus, he directly transported Xuan Dan and others across the Sea of Huantian to the Upper Three Heavens, which caused such a long delay.

"Disciple!" When Luo Tian and Xuan Dan appeared, the disciples and elders immediately bowed respectfully, their eyes filled with reverence as they paid homage to Luo Tian. In their hearts, he would forever be the Disciple. These people had not expected Luo Tian to have reached Buxian Mountain; normally, they would never have been allowed into Buxian Mountain. But now he had arrived at the sacred site of the Immortal World, one of the Nine Supreme Sects.

"Don't be nervous. I've called you all here to ask for your help!" Luo Tian smiled, looking at the disciples who were somewhat tense.

"Disciple, please speak! If it weren't for you, we wouldn't still be alive. Whatever you need us to do, even if it costs our lives, we'll do it!" A disciple shouted. At this point, Luo Tian had become a faith for the Shenglong Sect.

As the youth's words finished, other disciples of Shenglong Sect also shouted in unison, their voices filled with fervor.

"Alright, I'm not asking you to fight. Let's go!" Luo Tian chuckled and spoke to these disciples, stepping out of the courtyard.

"Ahh..." The disciples of Shenglong Sect were stunned for a moment, but then realized that with Luo Tian's current strength, they weren't needed. They obediently followed behind Luo Tian as he walked toward the Hall of Punishment.

A group of hundreds immediately drew attention from Buxian Mountain disciples. Soon, an eighth peak disciple who had been monitoring Luo Tian's movements relayed the news back to the eighth peak.

"I don't believe a kid could stir up much trouble. Let's observe again!" Lin Yuanhang sneered, believing Luo Tian could never solve the alchemy master issue. An hour later, Luo Tian and Xuan Dan arrived at the Hall of Punishment, directly heading toward the hall where Zhang Ziping and others were.

"Everyone, I'm back!" Luo Tian pushed open the door with a smile, seeing Zhang Ziping and others had been waiting there.

"Kid, what's your plan?" The elders immediately shouted as Luo Tian entered the hall. Seeing Luo Tian had brought an old man with him, their faces immediately showed impatience.

"I've found the alchemy master. This is Xuan Dan, Master of Shenglong Sect from the Middle Three Heavens and also my elder brother!" Luo Tian addressed them.

"Respectfully, I am Xuan Dan of Shenglong Sect!" Xuan Dan smiled gently and bowed to them, showing no signs of nervousness.

Seeing Xuan Dan, the crowd nodded in approval. A sect from the Middle Three Heavens coming to pay homage to Buxian Mountain, they were all nervous. But this old man showed no fear at all, remaining calm and composed. Just that composure was rare.

"Xuan Dan?" Hearing Xuan Dan speak, the people in the hall thought for a moment before recalling the intelligence. The Hall of Punishment's intelligence network naturally knew about Shenglong Sect in the Middle Three Heavens. The most famous figure of Shenglong Sect was Xuan Dan.

"Senior Brother?" Zhang Ziping's eyebrows slightly furrowed, paying close attention to Luo Tian's title. They had never met Xuan Dan before and scrutinized him carefully.

"May I ask what rank of alchemy master is Xuan Dan?" An elder asked, bowing slightly.

Although they had heard of Xuan Dan's name, in their view, an alchemy master from the Middle Three Heavens could never match the eighth peak's alchemy masters.

"I've just been promoted to an eight-rank alchemy master!" Xuan Dan smiled lightly and said.

"Eight-rank!" Upon hearing Xuan Dan's words, the people in the hall immediately changed their expressions. The entire hall became quiet for a moment; an eight-rank alchemy master was only two in the eighth peak.

"Ha! Master Xuan, please sit. My apologies for not greeting you properly!" The elders in the hall immediately pulled Xuan Dan over, offering him a seat. Their attitude suddenly became warm. Xuan Dan remained composed and conversed with them, and soon the atmosphere in the hall became lively. There was no longer any of the previous gloom.

These elders had been troubled for too long over the alchemy master issue. Now, seeing an eight-rank alchemy master, their eyes turned green.

"However, Master Xuan's presence still can't solve the problem. Even if Master Xuan were to make pills every day, it wouldn't be enough for all the disciples of the Hall of Punishment!" Amidst the noise, an elder spoke up, quieting the hall.

"Enough! Enough!" The elders laughed heartily. They hadn't expected Luo Tian's solution to be this simple. A few hundred alchemy masters weren't many, but they would suffice for the Hall of Punishment. As long as used properly, it could be enough.

"The bastards from the eighth peak! I want to see how they'll endure this time. If Lin Yuanhang doesn't come to beg us, we'll let him starve!" One elder laughed loudly, his voice shaking the hall.

"Exactly! The Hall of Punishment is the first peak. Those alchemy masters from the eighth peak have their butts sticking out of their faces. Do they think the Immortal World only has alchemy masters from them?" Other elders also laughed heartily. After a while of commotion, they arranged the matters. Each disciple from Shenglong Sect was assigned accommodation and began making pills.

"Every disciple of the Hall of Punishment, come to Master Luo for pill-making!" Zhang Ziping's voice echoed in the minds of all Hall of Punishment disciples, instantly becoming a storm that swept through.

"Can they really make pills?" The faces of the Hall of Punishment disciples showed shock, and they all stood up, heading toward Luo Tian's residence.

Hundreds of Shenglong Sect alchemy masters and elders stood anxiously, watching the fierce Hall of Punishment disciples. They were shocked by the strength of Buxian Mountain's Hall of Punishment, which was far stronger than Shenglong Sect.

"Can you make a four-rank immortal pill?" A young man, doubtful, approached one disciple and asked. This disciple was Tian Xiong, who had once competed in the alchemy competition with Luo Tian at Tianmen Sect and made it to the top four. Over the years, Tian Xiong's strength and alchemy skills had significantly improved.

"Yes!" Tian Xiong lightly bowed, his eyes showing confidence.

"How much do you charge?" A disciple from the Hall of Punishment asked, still skeptical. They didn't know where these alchemy masters had come from.

"Take... take two percent..." Tian Xiong was a bit nervous, speaking softly with hesitation.

"Two percent?" Upon hearing Tian Xiong's words, the disciple's eyebrows slightly furrowed. Tian Xiong's heart skipped a beat: "Senior Brother, this is Master Luo's rule. I can't do anything about it!" Normally, alchemy masters would charge three percent. Luo Tian knew these Shenglong Sect disciples might earn less because of Buxian Mountain, so he set the minimum at two percent. The rest was up to them.

"Ah, the price is cheap. It's much cheaper than those bastards from the eighth peak. Last time, they took four percent! Make it, and if I'm satisfied, I'll give you an additional one percent!"

"Of course, if you don't satisfy me, there'll be trouble. Even Master Luo might not be able to protect you!" That disciple coldly spoke, handing the items over to Tian Xiong's hands.

"Senior Brother, rest assured. Three days later, come and collect the pills. Four-rank immortal pills, I'm quite confident in my ability!" Tian Xiong spoke and took the storage bag.

Other disciples from Shenglong Sect also continuously collected storage bags. These Hall of Punishment disciples kept bringing over herbs, not worrying about these alchemy masters playing tricks. After all, this was the Hall of Punishment.

Although Shenglong Sect disciples collected less fees, they were numerous. This allowed these disciples to earn quite a bit. Moreover, the herbs brought by Hall of Punishment disciples were high quality and could significantly improve Shenglong Sect's alchemy skills.

"Boom... boom..." Suddenly, the surrounding of Luo Tian's courtyard was filled with booming sounds. Elder Bear Qianshan and others had specially built a dedicated alchemy area for Shenglong Sect disciples, taking this matter very seriously.

"Ha! Tian Xiong, thank you!" Three days later, the first batch of Hall of Punishment disciples who received pills were overjoyed. They discovered that these Shenglong Sect disciples' pills were no worse than those from the eighth peak.

In an instant, the Hall of Punishment disciples became even more active. Shenglong Sect disciples started working day and night.

"Ha! Luo Tian, you really have it in you. Now we can wait for the eighth peak to cry!" Elder Bear Qianshan and others, seeing that the Hall of Punishment disciples had returned to normal, sighed in relief.

Time flowed slowly. A month passed, and the Hall of Punishment still had people stationed at the eighth peak every day.

"This has been a month. Why does the Hall of Punishment look like nothing happened? Do they not need pills?" Lin Yuanhang finally couldn't sit still. According to his prediction, the Hall of Punishment would surely be exhausted within this month.

"It's not right. Something is definitely wrong. Go and find out what's going on!" Lin Yuanhang's face darkened. In the past month, the eighth peak and Hall of Punishment were completely different; the latter was lifeless. However, those who went to investigate found nothing. After all, the Hall of Punishment controlled intelligence; if they wanted to block information, it was hard for the eighth peak to find out.

Chapter 2296: Recognition()

A gloomy atmosphere spread across the eighth peak. The alchemy masters of the eighth peak watched the cold-faced Hall of Punishment disciples stationed there, as if a great chasm, blocking those who wanted to make pills from entering the eighth peak. No one dared to approach the eighth peak's alchemy masters for pill-making.

Although these Hall of Punishment disciples had also been cold-faced a month ago, the alchemy masters could sense their longing for the eighth peak's alchemy masters to help them make pills. This made the eighth peak people know that the Hall of Punishment wouldn't last long, and eventually, the eighth peak would win. But now that longing was gone.

The same gloom also affected the eighth peak's elders, who couldn't understand why there was such a big change suddenly.

"It's Luo Tian. He must have found hundreds of alchemy masters somewhere!" As Lin Yuanhang was anxious, Jiang Yulong and four others walked in with dark faces, speaking to Lin Yuanhang. This made Lin Yuanhang's face even darker.

"Luo Tian, it's that kid again!" Upon hearing Jiang Yulong and four others' words, Lin Yuanhang's face turned even darker.

"What do we do? The Hall of Punishment's alchemy master issue has been resolved. We have nothing to threaten them with. On the contrary, if this continues, we'll be surrounded by the first peak eventually!" One elder spoke seriously.

"Find a way. Our alchemy masters can't lose!" Lin Yuanhang said, making the hall fall silent again. They really couldn't think of any way. Lin Yuanhang also knew that if they didn't solve the alchemy masters Luo Tian brought, they would have no chance at all.

Time flowed. Another month passed. The eighth peak still hadn't found a way to eliminate the Hall of Punishment's alchemy masters. Killing in the Hall of Punishment was completely suicidal behavior.

Buxian Mountain disciples were also complaining, but the Hall of Punishment didn't budge. If anyone came to make pills, the Hall of Punishment would investigate thoroughly and catch them if there were problems. They didn't show any mercy.

"The eighth peak has lost!" Other peaks' masters sighed longingly, knowing the eighth peak wouldn't last long. The eighth peak's alchemy masters also didn't want to get up; no pills meant a torment for alchemy masters.

Jiang Yulong and his four brothers also knew this truth. Unless the Grand Master of Buxian Hall intervened, those masters wouldn't help the eighth peak. Therefore, Jiang Yulong and his four brothers left the eighth peak to find another way.

Jiang Yulong's group leaving completely took away the eighth peak's will to resist, making the Hall of Punishment elders very happy.

In the Hall of Punishment's hall, it was completely different from the eighth peak. The elders were smiling and laughing. At first, they had been worried, but after the Hall of Punishment disciples received pills and didn't say anything bad about them, they completely relaxed. They also had Xuan Dan make quite a few pills and were very satisfied. The crisis brought by the eighth peak was finally resolved.

"Ha! Is the eighth peak about to give up?" Bear Qianshan laughed loudly, his voice shaking the hall.

"Exactly! I guess next it'll be Lin Yuanhang coming to find us!" Other elders also smiled, feeling great joy.

"This time it was all thanks to Luo Tian. It has made the Hall of Punishment's position more stable and re-echoed the Hall of Punishment's name in Buxian Mountain!" People turned their eyes to Luo Tian.

This seemingly was a confrontation between two peaks, but for the Hall of Punishment it was very important. Zhang Ziping had just taken office and needed some events to establish his position. The confrontation with the eighth peak also helped Zhang Ziping stabilize completely.

Time flowed slowly again, and after another half a month, when the Hall of Punishment people felt the eighth peak was about to give up, a message spread throughout Buxian Mountain: The eighth peak's master had returned!

This news immediately drew the Hall of Punishment's attention. Everyone knew that the eighth peak's master was protective, and knowing this matter would definitely be angry.

"Son of a bitch! That Zhang Ziping, come and see me!" Indeed, after the news returned, an angry voice echoed from the eighth peak.

"Refuse. I'm busy!" Zhang Ziping strongly replied, still sitting in the Hall of Punishment every day. This completely caused a stir throughout Buxian Mountain.

"Who dares to defy the eighth peak's master?" All disciples and elders of Buxian Mountain, even other peaks' masters were shocked. They hadn't expected Zhang Ziping to respond like this.

Who was the eighth peak's master? The fifth brother of Buxian Immortal King and also the fifth elder brother of Jiang Taibai. He wasn't like other peak masters, which was why the eighth peak dared to challenge the Hall of Punishment. In short, Buxian Mountain was all Jiang's. Zhang Ziping dared to defy the eighth peak master like this, making it hard for them to save face. If they angered the eighth peak's master, their lives might be in danger, just like someone who had angered Jiang Taibai and lost their life. Two of the most important peaks in Buxian Mountain were controlled by the two brothers of Buxian Immortal King.

"Useless, a bunch of useless people! They were bullied by a newly appointed deputy commander!"

"I wasn't away for these years, how did you become so useless!" In the eighth peak's hall, an old man kept shouting. His voice echoed from the hall, scaring the guards.

In the hall, an old man sat there, thin and bony like a monkey jumping around. Behind him stood a woman, elegant and graceful, watching the old man shouting and secretly smiling.

Next to the old man were several elders. The old man scolded them like dogs, spittle falling on these elders. No one could believe that the eighth peak's elders were being scolded like this, even Lin Yuanhang was no exception.

"Let's go. I want to see what kind of nerve the Hall of Punishment has, if it doesn't work, I'll loosen their skin!" The old man stood up and walked out of the hall.

"Yes!" Upon hearing the old man's words, Lin Yuanhang and others felt great joy. If the old man came out, then everything was no longer a problem. Even if Jiang Taibai himself came, this person might still slap them twice.

A group of people marched out of the eighth peak with great momentum and headed toward the Hall of Punishment's mountain.

At this time, Luo Tian and others were sitting there discussing quietly, their faces showing concern.

"Ziping, if the eighth peak's master comes, don't be impulsive. We'll just apologize and it won't be a disgrace. Alas, our peak master isn't here; only the peak master could stop the eighth peak's master!" Bear Qianshan and others advised.

Jiang Taibai had left Buxian Mountain a month ago, going somewhere. No one expected the eighth peak's master to return at this time.

"Zhang Ziping, I've come to find you myself!" As Bear Qianshan and others were advising, an angry voice echoed from the Hall of Punishment's mountain. Before they could even open the hall door, a voice had already reached the outside.

"Let's go see!" Zhang Ziping coldly faced, leading the way out of the hall. Before they could even open the hall door, it suddenly burst open with a loud bang, revealing several figures in their sight.

"Who is Zhang Ziping? Come out and greet me!" A thin figure appeared in Luo Tian's sight, followed by the eighth peak's elders who were angry.

"Uh..." Upon seeing this thin figure, Luo Tian was slightly stunned and couldn't say anything for a moment.

"Zhang Ziping, Luo Tian! Do you think you can monopolize everything? Our peak master has returned. Don't be late, come and greet!" Jiang An spoke with a tone of superiority.

"Master Jiang!" Luo Tian took a step forward, standing beside Zhang Ziping and immediately addressing the fierce old man.

The number one alchemy master in the Immortal World, Jiang Yuexiong, and Long Youran's teacher. Luo Tian hadn't expected the eighth peak's master to be Jiang Yuexiong!

"Big Brother Luo!" Before Luo Tian's words had finished, a girl in white robes rushed to Luo Tian and hugged him. Luo Tian smiled on his face, eyes full of indulgence.

"Uh..." Jiang Yuexiong and Zhang Ziping were slightly stunned, as were Lin Yuanhang and others.

"What's going on..." Bear Qianshan and others stared in shock at Luo Tian being hugged by Long Youran.

"This kid's luck with women is still so good!" Lei Yong and Ji Chen looked awkwardly at Long Youran, eyes filled with looking at a future sister-in-law.

"This kid knows everyone..." Bear Qianshan and others felt shocked, not expecting Luo Tian to know so many people.

After entering Buxian Mountain, Jiang Taibai had actively recruited the Hall of Punishment to defend it. Then he brought Xuan Dan to resolve the Hall of Punishment's crisis. Now, he had also met the number one alchemy master in the Immortal World, Jiang Yuexiong, the eighth peak's master.

"You're that kid!" Jiang Yuexiong shouted loudly, bringing everyone back to their senses. Then he looked at Jiang Yuexiong.

"Respect the eighth peak's master!" Zhang Ziping slightly bowed, showing a bit of respect. Since Luo Tian knew him, Zhang Ziping's attitude still had to be maintained.

"Hmm..." Jiang Yuexiong looked at the girl hugging Luo Tian, coughed slightly and grabbed Long Youran, pulling her forward.

"Long Youran, be modest. Girls should be modest!" Jiang Yuexiong spoke to the excited Long Youran.

"Tell me, what's going on?" Jiang Yuexiong looked at Luo Tian with a slightly disdainful expression, feeling this kid wasn't good.

"Master, the situation is like this. I wanted to see the eighth peak's alchemy formulas, but..." Luo Tian truthfully explained the entire process to Jiang Yuexiong, making Jiang Yuexiong's face slightly change.

"Too bad. They bullied my Big Brother Luo, Master, you must punish these bastards!" Long Youran looked at Luo Tian with stars in her eyes and spoke to Jiang Yuexiong, naturally supporting Luo Tian.

"Why didn't anyone tell me about this situation?" Jiang Yuexiong coldly spoke, looking at Lin Yuanhang and others.

Chapter 2297: Dueling Alchemy()

Faced with Jiang Yuexiong's cold expression, everyone felt their spines go cold. Jiang An quickly spoke: "Peak Master, this was Luo Tian's fault first. If he had been polite and reasonable, I would have let him see it. But he was arrogant and affected my alchemy lecture... I..."

"Rubbish! He clearly wanted to step on me, so I suppressed him..." Luo Tian spoke back directly.

"Who said rubbish!" The eighth peak's elders weren't the type to be insulted. They immediately shouted back.

"Who are you talking about? If you dare, come out and fight. I won't let you live if I don't make you vomit blood!" Bear Qianshan and others also shouted, seeing Luo Tian knew Jiang Yuexiong. Their courage grew.

Two groups immediately started shouting at each other. Bear Qianshan's group came from Buxian City, and the alchemy masters were usually arrogant. They weren't a match for Bear Qianshan's group in terms of cursing. Soon, the alchemy masters' faces turned red and they panted heavily.

"Enough! Don't argue anymore. Luo Tian, you want to make pills?" Jiang Yuexiong looked at Luo Tian with a slight smile.

"Yes, I do know some alchemy!" Luo Tian spoke softly, showing respect. Jiang Yuexiong was the number one alchemy master in the Immortal World; Luo Tian wouldn't dare to be arrogant.

"Good. If you know alchemy, it's easy. You two will duel in a life-or-death alchemy match!" Jiang Yuexiong spoke softly, his eyes filled with amusement.

"Life-or-death alchemy?" Luo Tian slightly furrowed his eyebrows, not knowing what life-or-death alchemy was. Zhang Ziping and others were also confused.

"Who wins lives, who loses dies!" Jiang Yuexiong spoke again, his eyes filled with a smile. Zhang Ziping and others took a deep breath.

"However, you are both from Buxian Mountain. Let's skip the life-or-death part. I'll control the power well, just let you lie for a month!" Jiang Yuexiong spoke again.

"Good!" Jiang An's face showed great joy. In his view, Luo Tian was just a kid who needed to check the alchemy formulas in the alchemy hall. His alchemy skills were definitely much worse than his, and Jiang Yuexiong clearly wanted him to win.

"Peak Master is so kind. He really favors us!" Jiang An thought to himself, looking at Luo Tian with disdain.

"This isn't so good..." Luo Tian spoke softly. He had heard Jiang An's alchemy lecture, and he felt that Jiang An's alchemy skills were good but not very strong. Although he hadn't been making alchemy for years and was a bit rusty, he was about equal to Jiang An. However, Luo Tian had the Nine-Colored Flame and alchemy techniques; Jiang An definitely couldn't match him. He felt it was a bit unfair to take advantage of Jiang An.

"Kid, if you're not brave enough, say so. I'm generous and won't fight with you. Just admit defeat and apologize to me, and this matter will be over!" Jiang An looked at Luo Tian with mockery.

"Exactly! The eighth peak has always been very generous. This matter will be over!" Other elders of the eighth peak also spoke, finally having a way out. They wanted to descend.

"Since it's like that, let's duel. But Master Jiang, please confirm that no one will be in danger. It would also be good for you to guide me a bit!" Luo Tian spoke to Jiang Yuexiong.

"Are you really daring to fight?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the eighth peak people were surprised for a moment but then laughed inwardly, thinking Luo Tian was seeking his own demise.

"This is unfair!" Bear Qianshan and others shouted, their eyes filled with anger as they looked at Jiang Yuexiong. Alchemy was the eighth peak's specialty, and although they had heard Zhang Ziping say Luo Tian was an alchemy master, they absolutely didn't think Luo Tian could beat the eighth peak's elder. Only Xuan Dan, Zhang Ziping, and Long Youran had smiles on their faces. Seeing Luo Tian's expression like this, they knew the alchemy duel was no contest.

Xuan Dan's eyes were even filled with anticipation. Xuan Dan knew that Jiang Yuexiong and Zhang Daotian were from the same era, and they had once dueled. In the end, Zhang Daotian won, and that was Jiang Yuexiong's only defeat in alchemy. At this moment, Xuan Dan felt that Luo Tian was representing Zhang Daotian of the past, and Jiang An represented Jiang Yuexiong of the past.

"Good kid!" Jiang Yuexiong finally showed a slight expression of admiration. He waved his hand, and the earth began to tremble. A high platform rose from the ground, appearing in everyone's sight.

"Make your best pills!"

"Each person is limited to three furnaces. If you can't make it in three, you lose! Write down the herbs you need, and I'll send someone to get them." Jiang Yuexiong addressed Luo Tian and Jiang An.

"Jiang An, this is a good opportunity to show off in front of the peak master. It's also a chance to regain the eighth peak's face. If you lose, we won't forgive you!" Lin Yuanhang and others transmitted to Jiang An.

"Relax, he's just a kid. Even if he started making pills from birth, how many years has he been doing it?" Jiang An smiled confidently and stepped onto the platform.

"Luo Tian, no matter the result, it's about participation! If you lose, it's not a big deal. At worst, just apologize. Then we'll spread the word that the eighth peak master suppressed us and made us apologize!" Bear Qianshan and others also transmitted to Luo Tian, having already planned an escape route for him, removing his pressure.

Luo Tian was slightly speechless as he stepped onto the platform. Facing Jiang An's disdain, he smiled inwardly and shook his head lightly. He sat down in meditation to adjust his state.

Jiang An also smiled and sat down, adjusting his state. The scene quickly fell into silence.

"What kind of pills are you making? Six-rank?"

"Probably won't work. I have a chance with six-rank pills, but I can improve it by adding those demon seeds!" Luo Tian kept thinking. During the time of opposing the eighth peak, he hadn't been idle; every day he had thought about how to add those demon seeds into the pills. He had even tried, but failed.

Let's do it! Luo Tian started pushing and evolving in his mind. He kept rising the names of various herbs, simulating alchemy scenes.

Time passed. An hour later, both were meditating with their eyes closed. Jiang An finally opened his eyes slowly, his eyes calm and composed. He waved his hand, and a green alchemy furnace appeared before him.

"It's a replica of the Buxian Furnace!" Seeing Jiang An's furnace, Lin Yuanhang and others smiled.

As he spoke, Jiang An received the herbs from Lin Yuanhang. His hands started moving, leaving a trail of shadows as if he had ten hands. Each herb was sent into the alchemy furnace before him.

"Fly-Hand Technique! Jiang An has already mastered twelve hands. I didn't expect his progress to be so fast. It seems he's not far from becoming a seven-rank alchemy master!" Lin Yuanhang and others smiled, feeling confident of victory.

"This..." Lei Yong and Ji Chen were speechless watching Lin Yuanhang's group, not expecting them to be so arrogant.

"My younger brother's techniques are much better!" Lei Yong was undeterred, which caused Lin Yuanhang and others to mock.

"Ha! Better? How much better can it be? Don't talk nonsense. Alchemy isn't just about strength!" The eighth peak's elders heard Lei Yong and laughed even more.

"Does anyone dare to bet? Let the stakes be the same as Luo Tian and his group. Whoever loses will lie in bed for a month, but let me relieve my itch by beating you into helplessness!" Lei Yong shouted loudly, his voice filled with anger.

"Good! I'll bet you. It's also a way to relieve my resentment!" A senior stepped forward and shouted loudly.

"Little Brother, you must win! If not, I'll be in the same situation as you!" Lei Yong shouted loudly, his voice filled with anxiety.

"He's afraid. He's the one who knows Luo Tian best. If he's afraid, it means this Luo Tian really has no talent!" The eighth peak's elders felt more secure.

"Nine-Flame Heaven Pill!" As the outside people argued, Luo Tian seemed to ignore it. His mind kept evolving the process of making pills.

"Demons' energy is yin, only a pill with extremely yang and strong properties can neutralize it. The Nine-Flame Heaven Pill is a six-rank pill, which is most suitable!"

"Let's try!" After evolving for half an hour, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. He waved his hand and the Tiance Flame Furnace appeared in front of him. At this moment, Jiang An had already reached the stage of solidifying the pills. Seeing Luo Tian just started, he felt a bit disdainful.

"Only after so long to calm down. This kid might not even be a three-rank alchemy master!" Jiang An thought with mockery.

"Boom..." But as Jiang An mocked, a thunderous sound echoed in front of him.

"Woo..." A green light rose into the sky, a wild wave that made Jiang An's face change. The wild energy caused the platform to tremble slightly, making everyone's heart jump. They watched the earth-shaking storm.

"Explosion!" Jiang Yuexiong smiled lightly and grabbed Jiang An, who was terrified.

"Don't be overambitious. Seven-rank pills aren't easy to make!" Jiang Yuexiong frowned slightly and spoke to Jiang An.

"Ah, I see. Jiang An was trying to make a seven-rank immortal pill. That's why it exploded!" Upon hearing Jiang Yuexiong's words, the eighth peak elders immediately showed understanding.

"Jiang An, make six-rank pills. That way you can still win!" One elder spoke up, the one who had bet with Lei Yong. He was afraid Jiang An would stubbornly try for seven-rank pills and explode all three furnaces, which would definitely lose.

"Ah!" Jiang An nodded. He knew seven-rank pills weren't something he could make yet. He returned to the platform and started making again.

"Boom..." As Jiang An was about to make, a wave rose near him. Luo Tian also started making pills.

Chapter 2298: Thunder of the Dao

The Thousand-Leaf Brushing Hand, Luo Tian was very familiar with it. He immediately entered a state of mind, and a series of hand shadows appeared before him, like pages of books being flipped by the wind. It was dazzling and even a true immortal at the later stage couldn't see Luo Tian's movements, only seeing trails of shadows.

"Fast!" Everyone was stunned by Luo Tian's hand technique. Their eyes showed disbelief, not expecting Luo Tian's techniques to be so strong.

Wind swept through, blowing on everyone's robes. Jiang Yuexiong's face also changed, and he couldn't help but mutter.

"This technique... it feels familiar. I've seen it somewhere before, but I can't remember!" Jiang Yuexiong muttered softly, his eyes fixed on Luo Tian.

"One... ten... a hundred..." In an instant, over two hundred herbs were sent into the furnace by Luo Tian.

"Chirp..." Nine-colored flames, dazzling and colorful, rushed into the furnace's mouth. The extreme temperature swept through the Tiance Flame Furnace.

"What is this flame? How can it have nine colors!" Seeing the nine-colored flames, people were again shocked. This was their first time seeing nine-colored flames.

"Human-shaped flame! I heard only human-shaped flames can become multi-color!" Lin Yuanhang spoke in disbelief, his voice filled with amazement.

"How is it possible! Even the peak master didn't have a human-shaped flame. He only cultivated four colors of fire, and he still needed three more to reach a human shape!" Other elders also spoke, their eyes looking at Luo Tian's nine-colored fire with greed and envy. This was a deadly temptation for alchemy masters, like a wolf seeing an exquisite beauty.

"Nine-colored fire..." Jiang An was also speechless looking at Luo Tian's nine-colored fire, but then his eyes showed disdain.

"Unfortunately, such a good flame is in his hands!" Jiang An still didn't believe Luo Tian could win. Even though Luo Tian's alchemy techniques and fire were strong, they were all better than his.

"About enough!" Luo Tian skillfully refined the elixirs, and his speed was much faster than Jiang An's. Soon, over two hundred herbs were refined into elixirs and swirled in the Tiance Flame Furnace.

Over two hundred herbs were mostly extremely yang and strong. After Luo Tian refined them, they became a long green dragon roaring in the Tiance Flame Furnace. If this long dragon was solidified into a pill, it would be a six-rank immortal pill, the Nine-Flame Heaven Pill. Taking this pill was equivalent to half a decade of cultivation.

"Demons' seeds!" Luo Tian didn't care and directly took out the black demon seeds. Upon seeing this, Jiang Yuexiong's face changed again.

Black demon seeds with flowing inscriptions radiated a wild energy, making people's faces show concern. It seemed to contain infinite power, but all of it was sealed by the black inscriptions. If it burst out, it would destroy heaven and earth.

"What is that? Can it be made into pills?" People shouted in surprise, not knowing what Luo Tian was up to.

But before the people's words had finished, Luo Tian didn't hesitate and threw the black demon seeds into the Tiance Flame Furnace.

"Boom..." Upon entering the Tiance Flame Furnace, the black demon seeds immediately caused a violent collision.

Water and fire are incompatible. Yin and Yang are also incompatible. The black demon seeds immediately turned into a long black dragon, colliding with the green long dragon.

Luo Tian's face was pale. He kept refining, but this two dragons consumed him greatly. Luo Tian had tried before and failed every time.

"Explosion!" Luo Tian shouted, finally unable to control the two wild forces and flew away from the platform.

"Little bastard!" Jiang Yuexiong growled, his hands moving rapidly. His eyes showed a slight concern. He sent several seals from his hands into the Tiance Flame Furnace, then grabbed it and flew toward the sky.

"Boom... boom..." The next moment, the entire Hall of Punishment's sky trembled. A black vortex appeared in the sky over the Hall of Punishment.
