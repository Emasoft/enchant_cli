"Lord of Cutting Heaven... I never thought I'd see the Lord of Cutting Heaven..." Luo Tian had never imagined that he would witness the Lord of Cutting Heaven.

"Indeed, they're all still alive!" Luo Tian's gaze swept around again, searching for the most rebellious epoch master of humanity—the Lord of Breaking Heaven, Wang Duantian.

"Stop searching. Master Wang isn't here," Gu Tianxiu said, understanding Luo Tian's intent.

"Hey kid, don't you recognize me?" The initially strong man protested, pointing at his own nose.

"Are you the Savage God of the蛮族?" Luo Tian observed the man's robust physique and his resemblance to Chen Zhanbiao.

"Correct! I knew you couldn't ignore my name, the Savage God!" The man laughed heartily, his voice like thunder.

"Let me catch my breath..." Luo Tian was overwhelmed. For the first time in his life, he felt like he was dreaming. These figures were legendary to him, and seeing so many at once left him stunned.

"Altogether eight people. All from the Nine Realms, and except for Gu Tianxiu, they were all epoch masters of the Nine Realms," Gu Tianxiu said with a smile, introducing Luo Tian to each one.

"Respectful greetings to the masters," Luo Tian bowed respectfully, acknowledging these former titans of the Nine Realms.

Among these eight, the Lord of Cutting Heaven and the Savage God were the strongest. Luo Tian could not fathom their cultivation levels.

"Savage God, I'm good friends with your son. Master Miaoyin is also a close friend of your son Zhong Zixuan. Also..." Luo Tian began recounting the Nine Realms' stories, as Gu Tianxiu had been away for a long time and didn't know everything.

"Child!" The former epoch masters, kings of the royal family, showed rare gentleness on their faces when Luo Tian spoke of their sons.

"Thankfully, none of the people I killed had parents here. Otherwise it would be awkward..." Luo Tian thought to himself, though he was connected with many of these people's descendants and had even killed quite a few.

But Luo Tian knew they lived too long, so they only cared about their direct bloodlines. As long as their sons weren't killed, there was no problem.

"My son's a glutton," the Savage God said with a foolish grin, scratching his head habitually—his demeanor was identical to Chen Zhanbiao's.

"How did you get here?" Gu Tianxiu smiled, interrupting the conversation and asking Luo Tian.

"Everyone from the Nine Realms, stop arguing!" Others on the mountain peaks spoke up. There were over a hundred people here, and they had been staying for a long time. Though they often quarreled, their relationships were very close.

For example, Ji Miaoyin had killed many savages almost wiping out the savage clan. But now he was getting along with the Savage God, having abandoned old grudges. They were also from different eras.

"I came here because Jiang Taibai's disciple told me," Luo Tian said.

"We've established a sect in the Nine Realms, but due to my reasons, I have many enemies. I came to see if Master Gu could come out and stay for a while," Luo Tian said frankly.

"I can't leave," Gu Tianxiu shook his head gently, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Each of these one hundred and eight peaks must be guarded. If I leave, the consequences would be catastrophic. Unless you take my place, or someone new takes my place," Gu Tianxiu shook his head.

"Kid, stay for a while. Let me go out and have some fun!" The Savage God laughed heartily, his voice filled with eagerness. Others also nodded, clearly having stayed too long. Many of them had entered the Immortal Realm and directly fallen into the Timeless Mountain, then passed the trials to reach here.

"Kid, what enemies do you have? I'll exterminate them for you!" Several strong figures shouted confidently.

"Guys, haven't you heard of the Nine Immortal Mountains?" Luo Tian sighed, his mind puzzled. What was this massive formation maintained by so many strong figures?

Luo Tian explained the Immortal Realm's forces again, recounting his feud with Eternal Life Mountain to Gu Tianxiu. Everyone listened carefully, even the most distant ones.

"So I really can't beat them. Maybe if the elder comes, he could destroy them!" The Savage God looked embarrassed and muttered.

"Less than a year left?" Gu Tianxiu frowned slightly. He knew Luo Tian's nature—he would definitely go to Eternal Life Mountain to save Zhang Daotian. So he didn't stop him but thought about how to ensure Luo Tian's survival.

"Don't worry, Master Gu. I've cultivated the Wheel of Rebirth and have a clone in Hell. Even if I die, I can resurrect from Hell!" Luo Tian said confidently.

"I'm only worried about the Tianyuan Sect, but now it has Master Huo and Master Xiang, so there's no big problem," Luo Tian said with a careless expression.

"Stop talking nonsense. Walk through all one hundred and eight peaks before you leave. Try to improve your strength as soon as possible!" Gu Tianxiu said, leading Luo Tian down the mountain.

"Kid, come here. I'll teach you my new technique. Go and fight them, don't be cowardly!"

"I have a divine sword that can cut through anything. Take it, since there are many here," several old men shouted.

Luo Tian's mouth twitched as he listened to the curses, following Gu Tianxiu while observing the surroundings. He imagined the former glory of the ancient heavenly court.

"Before you leave, can you reach the middle stage of Immortal King? That should be possible," Gu Tianxiu said softly, leading Luo Tian to a ruined palace. He pushed open the decaying door and entered with Luo Tian.

A pool radiating ancient energy was visible.

"Roar..." A true dragon coiled above the pool, and faint roaring could be heard.

Luo Tian and Gu Tianxiu stepped into the pool. It was dry, but radiated powerful energy.

"I've improved so quickly because of this pool. Go on—try to refine as much as you can!" Gu Tianxiu told Luo Tian.

Chapter 2457: Soul-Refining Pool

"What are you refining? There's nothing here!" Luo Tian looked at the ancient pool, confused about what Gu Tianxiu meant.

"During the next period, you'll suffer a lot. But your rewards will be proportional!" Gu Tianxiu smiled and kicked Luo Tian into the pool.

"Boom..." Luo Tian fell directly into the pool, still confused. He looked around.

"Roar..." Before he could think further, roaring sounds filled his ears. A powerful energy surged from all directions, pressing down on him.

Terrifying pressure made Luo Tian's face change. His eyes showed fear as he sat on the ground.

"Dao Principle!" Luo Tian could clearly feel Dao Principles flowing through his body, pressing him down and increasing the pressure as if crushing him.

"This is the Soul-Refining Pool, a place where heavenly court masters cultivated. Although the divine liquid has dried up, the Dao Principles remain. Stay inside and refine it for an hour before coming out," Gu Tianxiu told Luo Tian.

"Everyone, please help this kid improve his strength. Tianxiu is deeply grateful!" Gu Tianxiu called to the other peak's strong figures.

"Where, where? We're all family. What's there to be polite about? I'm waiting for this kid to come back and take my place so I can go out and have some fun!"

"Tianxiu, don't be polite. We don't need anything now. Your descendant is our descendant!" Hearing Gu Tianxiu's words, others responded immediately.

Luo Tian heard Gu Tianxiu's voice. His expression changed. He knew Gu Tianxiu's character—this was the first time he had ever asked for help. This request was because of Luo Tian.

Gu Tianxiu chuckled and walked toward the mountain peak, sitting cross-legged and closing his eyes.

Luo Tian felt warm inside, his eyes moist with emotion. He regretted coming to see Gu Tianxiu; Gu Tianxiu had done enough for him over the years.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his eyes determined. He knew he might not have it easy in the coming time, but he vowed not to disappoint Gu Tianxiu.

"This was once the heavenly court. Although its glory has faded, it still holds a lot of resources left behind. So raising this kid to the middle stage of Immortal King isn't hard!"

"But time is tight. We'll have to use some extreme methods," people murmured, their eyes showing excitement. Luo Tian's arrival had brought them a bit of fun.

Luo Tian closed his eyes, sweat pouring from his forehead. His Mind-Devouring Scripture was constantly operating, refining the Dao Principles entering his body.

Refining it, Luo Tian suddenly realized that the speed of his Mind-Devouring Scripture had gradually increased. Those powerful Dao Principles were constantly refined into his cultivation.

Cracking sounds kept happening on Luo Tian's body. Although these Dao Principles increased the speed of his Mind-Devouring Scripture, the immense pressure made him painfully uncomfortable.

Time passed slowly. Half an hour had gone by. Under Luo Tian's rapid refinement, a complete fluctuation finally roamed through his body, connecting with his entire being.

"Refining Dao Principles can increase the speed of your scripture. How much it increases depends on how many you refine!" Gu Tianxiu's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

These things were prepared for heavenly court disciples. Since the danger wasn't as before that trial path, Gu Tianxiu didn't worry too much about Luo Tian's safety.

"Another one!" Luo Tian could clearly feel that his cultivation speed had doubled. How amazing was this!

Time passed, another half hour went by. An hour had passed. Luo Tian's body now had another Dao Principle, increasing the speed of his Mind-Devouring Scripture by two times.

"Enough! An hour is best!" Gu Tianxiu extended his hand, a golden hand grasping Luo Tian and pulling him out of the Soul-Refining Pool.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. A pain spread through his body, as if he had been shattered completely.

"Continue refining your scripture!" Gu Tianxiu shouted loudly, throwing Luo Tian into a flash of light toward the second peak adjacent to Gu Tianxiu's.

"Boom..." Luo Tian was like a ball, grabbed by a big hand. Then he saw a grotesque face.

The old man had a slight smile, but even when smiling, it was grotesque. His face had many scars, unknown how he got them. It was rare for an Immortal King to have such scars since enough time could heal them.

The old man held Luo Tian with one hand and a jade staff with the other. Next to him was another pool, but this one was full. It contained a pool of green liquid with chaotic energy, bubbling and emitting a foul smell that made Luo Tian's scalp tingle.

The old man kept stirring, throwing in handfuls of herbs. As the herbs entered the pool, they were immediately crushed by a force. After a incense time, the old man showed satisfaction. Regardless of Luo Tian's resistance, he threw him into the pool.

"Plunk..." Green liquid splashed up. Luo Tian's head throbbed, almost fainting from the foul smell.

"Gurgle..." As soon as he fell in, a lot of unknown liquid was poured into him. His face turned iron-gray immediately.

At the same time, an extreme pain spread through Luo Tian's entire body. It felt like thousands of steel needles were piercing him, unbearable for ordinary people. Luo Tian wanted to scream but immediately had a lot of liquid poured into his mouth.

"Refine your cultivation!"

"Don't waste my good medicine!" The grotesque old man's hoarse voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

"Refine it!" Although Luo Tian was in unbearable pain, he could feel the pool's liquid's power. He knew Gu Tianxiu wouldn't deceive him, so he concentrated on refining it.

The Mind-Devouring Scripture was already a rare scripture and had increased its speed by two times. Its cultivation flow was terrifying. Suddenly, a lot of medicinal liquid was refined.

"Boom..." After refining it, Luo Tian's mind shook. He felt a terrifying energy rushing into his meridians, forming a powerful cultivation that gathered toward his dantian.

"Good stuff! This is good stuff. My god, this moment was worth a year of cultivation!" Luo Tian felt ecstatic and didn't care about the foul smell or the excruciating pain. He started refining the pool's liquid.

"Lu Tian, you have good stuff. You didn't think of me. You're too unkind!" As Luo Tian was desperately refining the liquid, a surprised voice echoed in his mind.

"Supplemental Heaven Stone!" This sound also made Long Que's voice suddenly echo.

"Long Que, I swear, it's you. You bastard, I'll fight you!" Upon hearing Long Que's voice, the Supplemental Heaven Stone became excited. The red stone burst out, emitting a scorching atmosphere and began to fiercely absorb the liquid prepared for Luo Tian.

After the Supplemental Heaven Stone absorbed it, the pool's liquid became fluid and formed a small whirlpool, swirling toward Luo Tian and the Supplemental Heaven Stone.

"You bastard's supplement stone. This is mine!" Luo Tian cursed, but it was no use. The Supplemental Heaven Stone had been sleeping after defending him from the attack before, and it consumed a lot of energy. Now with this opportunity, even if the Supplemental Heaven Stone wasn't weak, it wouldn't miss this chance. How could the Supplemental Heaven Stone miss it?

As one person and one stone refined, the pool's liquid gradually decreased. The old man with a grotesque face showed an expression of disbelief.

"How is this possible? What scripture did this kid cultivate that he could absorb the six-turn yang liquid so fast? Even if it's more extreme, it's impossible to absorb this quickly!" The old man exclaimed. Other strong figures also turned their eyes toward Luo Tian, surprised.

"Magpie, I'm not the same as before. When I recover, I'll subdue you!" The Supplemental Heaven Stone absorbed while talking to the magpie, his voice full of anger.

"Long Que Master, did you provoke him before?" Luo Tian knew the Supplemental Heaven Stone's character. He called it happily, but being timid, he wouldn't dare to attack the magpie.

"Unexpectedly, this guy is also on you. What else do you have?"

"Just that he smashed a few sea demons with it!" Long Que replied somewhat helplessly.

"..." Luo Tian felt that Long Que wasn't telling the truth. If it was just this, the Supplemental Heaven Stone's reaction wouldn't be so big. However, Luo Tian didn't ask further and kept refining the liquid since the Supplemental Heaven Stone's speed was much faster than his.

Time passed slowly. Three days had gone by, and the last drop of liquid in the pool was absorbed by Luo Tian's refinement.

"Comfortable..." Luo Tian wore a satisfied expression. The unbearable pain disappeared, and he looked at the old man who had prepared the liquid with admiration.

"What are you?" The grotesque old man looked at Luo Tian as if looking at a monster. Others also looked at Luo Tian in disbelief.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian pretended innocence, but inwardly cursed the Supplemental Heaven Stone. He looked at the old man with confusion.

Chapter 2458: Forecasting

"How did you do it? That was a month's worth! You finished it in three days!" The grotesque old man exclaimed in shock.

"A month..." Luo Tian's heart was bleeding. He could imagine that if he had fully absorbed it, his cultivation would have increased significantly. But now it was all in the Supplemental Heaven Stone's mouth.

"This might be because of my special physique!" Luo Tian didn't know how to explain and looked at the old man.

"Damn it, go!" The old man slapped him with a hand. His cultivation was late-stage Immortal King, directly fanning Luo Tian's face and sending him flying to a mountain peak—Jie Tianzhu Jun Wulei's.

"Wait, next time I'll increase the dosage!" The grotesque old man shouted, his voice full of resentment.

"Respectful greetings, Master!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully. Facing this former titan of the human race in the Nine Realms, he was still a bit nervous.

"Come on, attack me!" Jie Tianzhu looked at Luo Tian. He had also been a reincarnation body, so he understood Luo Tian relatively well.

"Attack?" Luo Tian was confused. He looked at Jun Wulei, not knowing what he wanted to do.

"Teach you! After all, I'm also a reincarnation body!" Jie Tianzhu said, looking at Luo Tian with tenderness.

"Master, I'll start then!" Luo Tian was happy. He knew that Jie Tianzhu was also a reincarnation body.

In the next moment, Luo Tian's figure moved. He rushed toward Jie Tianzhu like lightning and threw a punch.

Ink patterns flowed, adding to Luo Tian's fist. At the same time, six fists appeared in front of Luo Tian and emitted a thunderous sound. The punch broke the void, rushing toward Jun Wulei.

A full-force attack—Luo Tian's incomplete technique combined with the Windy Storm was enough to shake the heavens. Two techniques converged on Luo Tian's fist.

"Good!" Jun Wulei's eyes flashed with light. He looked at Luo Tian with admiration and extended his hand to hit Luo Tian's fist.

"Boom..." The sky trembled, the world echoed. Luo Tian's fist collided with Jun Wulei's palm. A沉闷 sound spread around.

Luo Tian's body flew back, his internal organs shaking. He looked at Jun Wulei standing still with a smile.

"Immortal King's middle stage attack!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. He could feel that Jun Wulei's attack was within the Immortal King's middle stage.

"How is this possible!" Luo Tian exclaimed in his heart. He clearly knew his own strength. Even if it was the middle stage of Immortal King, it would be impossible to withstand. But Jie Tianzhu had simply waved his hand and sent him flying.

"Of course, Jiang Taibai's master said he couldn't beat them in three moves!" Luo Tian's mouth twitched, recalling what Jiang Taibai had said before.

"How did they do it?" Luo Tian suddenly became confused. He looked at the one hundred and eight people, feeling like he was the bottom of the pile here.

"Two techniques combined. It seems strong, but it's easy to be distracted. I can feel that you're already moving in the same direction as us!" Jun Wulei said. Then his hands quickly changed.

"This is a technique I've worked out myself. You can only refer to it, but not learn it. Everyone will evolve one of their own techniques for you. You need to carefully comprehend them!" Jie Tianzhu's words ended, and his hands quickly changed.

At the same time, people on other peaks also launched their attacks. A wave of power spread through the world. The Dao principles roared, each carrying a shocking impact.

Countless techniques surrounded Luo Tian, making his face shocked. These were complete great Dao arts and had been evolved by themselves.

"Nine Heavens Reincarnation Art. Using reincarnation power to strengthen oneself. I created it after entering here for a hundred years. Combined with my reincarnation body, it can unleash the ultimate attack of my reincarnation body!" Jun Wulei said.

"Return to Primordial Void Scripture. I perfected it when I reached the late stage of Immortal King..." Voices echoed, people kept speaking. Their voices carried arrogance. In the entire immortal realm, those who could evolve their own great techniques were definitely rare.

"This force could certainly destroy the immortal realm..." Luo Tian thought to himself, sighing inwardly. These people couldn't leave. If they could, the immortal realm would be another situation.

"What are you daydreaming about? Quick, comprehend!" Gu Tianxiu scolded. Luo Tian returned to his senses.

Luo Tian quickly sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and sent out his spiritual awareness to comprehend the great techniques.

A series of images appeared in Luo Tian's mind, as if a group of figures dominated the nine heavens and intimidated an era.

"He didn't cultivate his own divine energy. Now it's a bit late to evolve, since he has already reached Immortal King and even domain!" People murmured lowly.

"Other things can be delayed. This must make him change, as it relates to his future!"

"He has too much knowledge already. Therefore, it's more difficult to evolve!" Gu Tianxiu said softly.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian seemed to fall into a state, continuously evolving his incomplete great techniques.

"Brave, gentle, and strong..." Luo Tian thought to himself, recalling his feelings.

"But the characteristics of this technique are to borrow power. I've combined all the martial arts and scriptures I've learned into an amazing great technique!"

"So many, I need time!" Luo Tian thought to himself and started evolving frantically.

A month passed quickly. Luo Tian sat there all the time, entering a state of emptiness and constantly recalling his past.

"A month has passed. This kid hasn't given up yet?" People looked at Luo Tian, murmuring lowly.

A month was very short for them. They were surprised that Luo Tian hadn't rested at all in a month.

They knew the pain. It was a strong challenge for their minds, as they had to constantly evolve one martial art in their heads.

"Still not enough!" As people were murmuring, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were red, but the look of disappointment was in them.

"Three times! Not enough!" Luo Tian shook his head gently. He still hadn't fully evolved many martial arts.

"Good, take some rest. Three times is already good. There's no shortcut for this. It needs time!" Gu Tianxiu heard Luo Tian's words and spoke to him.

"If I complete all the evolutions, once this great technique is added, my attack will reach a terrifying level. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time!" Luo Tian muttered.

"Go on. Go back to the Soul-Refining Pool. There's still a lot to do!" Gu Tianxiu told Luo Tian, who nodded and stepped down from the mountain peak of Jie Tianzhu.

Another round of pain. Luo Tian was like a pile of rotten mud this time. His Mind-Devouring Scripture's speed had increased to three times.

"Plunk..." Sticky liquid poured into Luo Tian's mouth. He quickly started refining his Mind-Devouring Scripture and began to fiercely refine it.

"Ah..." Luo Tian kept shouting. He devoured and refined, competing with the Supplemental Heaven Stone. This time was even more painful, as the old man had said.

"I want to see if you can still absorb it in three days!" The old man's face was grotesque, watching Luo Tian painfully in the pool.

"Master, is there any more? Would you like to add some?" Luo Tian's face showed embarrassment as he spoke to the old man.

"Go away..." The old man shouted loudly, fanning Luo Tian with a hand and sending him flying to another mountain peak. This time it wasn't Jie Tianzhu.

"Master!" Luo Tian looked at the figure with admiration. A white-clothed woman, elegant and peerless. Time seemed to have left no trace on her face. Ji Miaoyin, the Master of妙音.

"I don't have any advice for you. I'll only give you a song to calm your mind. You seem very restless recently!" Ji Miaoyin said softly, raising her hand. A green zither appeared in her hands. Her delicate fingers plucked the strings, continuously playing.

The music began, and a pure energy fell on Luo Tian. He followed the music and sat cross-legged.

Peaceful, calm, and elegant... The entire one hundred and eight peaks fell into peace. Only a single song was passed.

After an hour, the music stopped. Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. His aura was stable, and he wore a calm expression. His mind was no longer as restless.

"It's been a long time since I heard Master Miaoyin play. Still so beautiful!" Strong figures spoke, their voices filled with admiration.

"Kid, come on! From today on, you must fight everyone every day!" The Savage God shouted excitedly.

"Yes!" Luo Tian stepped out, appearing on the Savage God's mountain palace. His aura rose again.

"I won't be like Jun Wulei. Today your hard days officially begin!" The Savage God shouted, his body growing.

Chapter 2459: Rapid Progress

The Savage God's body suddenly expanded, becoming ten thousand zhang tall. He stood proudly on the mountain peak, his body covered with complex savage script and emitting a terrifying aura. He looked at Luo Tian.

"Come on, kid! I'll fight you with my middle stage of Immortal King!" The Savage God laughed loudly, his voice thunderous.

"Manifesting the Heaven and Earth!" Luo Tian activated Manifesting the Heaven and Earth, his body suddenly expanding. However, it was only a thousand zhang tall. Although a thousand zhang was already high, compared to the Savage God's ten thousand zhang, it seemed small.

"Savage God's Anger Crushes the Heavens!" Thunderous voice echoed. The Savage God took a big step, directly using the Seven Steps of the Savage.

The big foot lifted and swept across nine heavens and ten earths, emitting a terrifying aura. It pressed toward Luo Tian.

"Savage God's Anger Crushes the Heavens!" Luo Tian also took a step, using the Seven Steps of the Savage to counter.

"Boom..." Thunder echoed. The world roared. Two big feet collided in the sky, exploding violently. Luo Tian's massive body kept retreating.

"You're still far behind!" The Savage God laughed and took another step. His second step came out, emitting a terrifying aura.

He was the Savage God, the creator of the Seven Steps of the Savage. He had once been the faith of the savage clan.

"Savage God's Second Step Crushes Stars!" Luo Tian countered with the Seven Steps of the Savage. Two big feet collided again, and Luo Tian's body directly fell from the mountain peak.

"Boom..."

His massive body landed on the ground, kicking up a large amount of dust. Luo Tian's mouth bled as he looked at the Savage God.

"You're still too far behind. Ultimately, it's the great technique!" Luo Tian thought to himself. These people had all evolved their own great techniques, so they were invincible within their level.

"Again! Fight until you open your eyes!" The Savage God beckoned Luo Tian with his finger, indicating he should go up the mountain again.

"I won't believe it!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a defiant spirit. He flew up again, continuously fighting with the Savage God.

Thunderous sounds kept echoing. Two massive figures constantly fought each other, but it was Luo Tian who was constantly being beaten. His massive body kept falling from the mountain peak, looking pitiful.

Time passed slowly. Half an hour had gone by. Luo Tian finally couldn't endure it, his cultivation completely drained. He lay on the ground, panting heavily.

"I can't fight anymore. Take a break!" Luo Tian said, his body feeling like it was broken apart.

"Then go to the Soul-Refining Pool!" The Savage God was very satisfied. He directly threw Luo Tian toward Gu Tianxiu, sending him back into the Soul-Refining Pool.

Another round of repetition. Accelerate the Mind-Devouring Scripture's operation, then absorb the liquid. Under the old man's shocked gaze, he was thrown to a mountain peak and continued fighting.

Luo Tian began an endless cycle of life, living in water and fire every day. He was constantly being beaten.

This kind of pain would drive anyone else mad, but Luo Tian enjoyed it. He could feel his strength was rapidly increasing.

Every day fighting against the top strong figures of the era, Luo Tian's progress was huge. The cost he paid was also significant. Every day felt like living in a hell.

Four months passed, and it had been one month since Luo Tian left the immortal realm.

"Gurgle..." In the green medicinal pool, Luo Tian kept refining the liquid. His dantian's magic platform constantly trembled with Dao patterns.

"Eight times the speed!" Luo Tian refined happily, his heart excited. He had finally matched the Supplemental Heaven Stone's absorption speed.

After absorbing all the liquid in the pool, Luo Tian didn't get up immediately. He closed his eyes and sat cross-legged.

"Enough! If you don't reach the middle stage of Immortal King, I can't afford it!" The grotesque old man looked at Luo Tian sitting there and prayed for him to reach the middle stage of Immortal King quickly.

These four months, the old man had consumed countless herbs—dozens of times more than expected. But it was Luo Tian who contributed the herbs he had obtained from the snake clan, barely managing to last until now.

"Middle stage of Immortal King. Open up!" Luo Tian's dantian churned with magic energy, three Dao patterns appearing on the magic platform. His aura rose accordingly, as if everything was natural.

Luo Tian opened his eyes and looked at the many peaks. He bowed respectfully. Half a year had passed, and he had reached the middle stage of Immortal King. This was impossible elsewhere but achievable here.

Some people took hundreds or thousands of years to improve, while Luo Tian reached it in months. This showed the terrifying power of the heavenly court.

"Nothing was wasted! We could only help so much!" Strong figures spoke, their eyes filled with smiles. Luo Tian's arrival had added a flavor to their monotonous lives.

"Kid, if you don't die, come back and take our place!" A strong man said, looking at Luo Tian.

"Yes, masters. Please rest assured!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his eyes full of respect.

"Middle stage of Immortal King. If I fully unleash it, I can try to fight the late stage of Immortal King!" Luo Tian thought to himself. Although he was still nothing compared to the peak of Immortal King, he had a bit more confidence.

Four months. Luo Tian's progress was huge—not only did he reach the middle stage of Immortal King, but his self-evolved great technique had also progressed faster with daily beatings. If given more time, Luo Tian was confident he could complete it.

"Boom..." Just as Luo Tian was excited, a thunderous sound echoed from the sky. A wild energy surged from the heavens.

The sky cracked, and all over the sky were cracks. From the fissures came roaring sounds, making Gu Tianxiu and others' faces serious.

"So soon?" Gu Tianxiu muttered. He immediately sat on the mountain peak, his hands constantly forming complex seals.

Other strong figures on the hundred and eight peaks also launched their attacks, their hands constantly moving. They cast Dao patterns from their hands.

"This is..." Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his face solemn.

The Dao principles roared. As the sky kept cracking, a terrifying energy spread out, making Luo Tian's face shocked. That energy was cold and ruthless, as if destroying all things in the world. It contained infinite power. Luo Tian even felt that if he fought with this energy's master, he would be shattered into pieces. This energy was superior to the Immortal King. Luo Tian even doubted whether an immortal emperor would avoid it.

"What's happening?" Luo Tian was shocked. He never expected the heavenly court to have something like this.

Luo Tian's shock was interrupted by Dao patterns flying from the hundred and eight peaks. Each pattern carried an extreme aura.

Patterns filled the sky, and the hundred and eight peaks radiated a terrifying divine power. The Dao principles roared across the world.
