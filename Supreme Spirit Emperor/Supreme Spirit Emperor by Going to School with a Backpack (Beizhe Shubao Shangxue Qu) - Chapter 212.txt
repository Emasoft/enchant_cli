“What’s going on! The Phoenix Clan leader, actually treating people from the Star Domain with courtesy! That’s a treatment even the Celestial Clan elder Sun Hewei didn’t receive!” The crowd, upon hearing Feng Hongzhi’s words, turned pale.

“Hmph, what’s so strange about that? The people from the Star Domain, the Shura Domain, and the Chaos Domain are all oddballs. Even the Celestial-Mortal Domain wouldn’t dare offend them!” Diao Dedu sneered, casting a dismissive glance at Feng Hongzhi.

The emergence of the Star Domain instantly sent a wave of turbulence through the auction. Whether it was the Celestial Clan or the Demon Clan, their faces darkened.

“Senior Grandmaster, the Star Domain’s prognosticators have arrived. Should you greet them?” The Celestial Clan members looked at Sun Hewei, their expressions carrying inquiry.

“Hmph. Just the Star Domain? No need. The Celestial Clan has never feared anyone. To make us bow, it would take the Star Domain’s domain master himself!” Sun Hewei remained calm, casting a single glance at the Star Domain representatives before closing his eyes again.

Sun Hewei was somewhat irritated. Feng Hongzhi’s attitude toward the Celestial Clan and his treatment of the Star Domain were entirely different concepts, which left the proud Celestial Clan with a sense of unease.

“Can you bring that Sacred Artifact over?” Zhou Wei smiled, addressing Feng Yuanqing and extending his hand. A massive surge of spiritual energy instantly formed throughout the auction hall.

“Roar…” a series of roars echoed, as spiritual energy shaped into two crystalline dragons that appeared before the crowd.

The jade-like, lifelike dragon-shaped soul spirit pulses floated above the auction hall. The dense spiritual energy made the air feel thick and viscous.

“Soul Spirit Pulse!” Luotian’s heart trembled. His gaze locked onto the two massive soul spirit pulses—this was his second encounter with such a phenomenon. The first had been in the Great An Forest of the Tianyuan Continent, where one had been grafted onto Long Jie’s body by the Dragon Sword couple.

Yet these two were leagues ahead of that one, completely different in grade.

“Those two soul spirit pulses should be worth fifty billion spiritual energy stones!” Zhou Wei collected the two pulses and presented them before Feng Yuanqing.

“Treasure! A single soul spirit pulse could become a sect’s foundation. To produce two at once and exchange for a sacred artifact is truly wasteful!” The crowd’s eyes gleamed with greed as they stared at the two dragon-like soul spirit pulses.

“Indeed, the Star Domain’s prognosticating skills are unmatched across the nine domains!” Sun Hewei sighed, his gaze on the soul spirit pulses before shifting to the Star Domain representatives.

The reason the Star Domain had made Feng Hongzhi wary and so respectful was due to their terrifying prognosticating arts. Not only could they avoid misfortune and seek benefit, but if they wished to outwit someone, they wouldn’t even need to move a finger—before one knew it, the victim would be dead.

“Sold!” Feng Yuanqing sighed, calling three more bids before no one else raised their price. With reluctance, he declared the sale.

The transaction official delivered Feng Chui Liujin Spear to the Star Domain representatives, took back the soul spirit pulses, and handed them to Diao Dedu. After paying a portion of the commission fee, the two soul spirit pulses were fully transferred to Diao Dedu’s possession.

“Truly a bargain!” Diao Dedu sat comfortably, his face filled with smugness as he awaited the next auction item.

“Now let’s see the second auction item!” Feng Yuanqing smiled again, addressing the crowd as he introduced the next piece.

Compared to the first sacred artifact, this second one seemed lackluster—a middle-grade sacred elixir. Still, it drew a frenzy from the Demon Domain’s people. For Luotian and others, it was nothing special, but for ordinary Supreme Beasts of the Supreme and Transcendent realms, it was akin to a second life.

Third item… fourth item…

Each auction item was introduced by Feng Yuanqing, and each one sparked a frenzy among the Demon Domain’s people, making them go mad.

However, few from other domains participated. Luotian only bid once, acquiring a rare herb for refining the Reincarnation Single, which wasn’t particularly precious but was bought at ten million spiritual energy stones.

As time passed, a full day had elapsed. The auction was gradually nearing its end, with each item growing more precious and prompting other domain elites to bid fiercely.

“Now I’ll auction a sacred herb—reviving the dead and mending bones. This sacred herb, unrefined into an elixir, is worth a middle-grade sacred elixir!” Feng Yuanqing’s face bore a hint of fatigue, clearly exhausted from speaking nonstop for a day.

“Eternal Life and Death Bamboo!” Feng Yuanqing’s voice carried excitement, erasing his previous fatigue. His tone became fervent.

“Eternal Life and Death Bamboo!” The entire auction hall fell silent for a moment before erupting in murmurs, with gasps of astonishment echoing through the venue.

Luotian’s eyes flashed with intensity. His gaze locked onto the curtain, a look of excitement on his face. The Eternal Life and Death Bamboo was one of the three main ingredients for refining the Reincarnation Elixir—unparalleled and priceless. Luotian hadn’t expected to encounter it at the Demon Domain’s auction.

“Must obtain it!” Luotian mentally cried, clenching his fists tightly.

“The Eternal Life and Death Bamboo! Indeed the Eternal Life and Death Bamboo! The Celestial Clan must seize it to prolong our Divine King’s life!” Sun Hewei and the other Celestial Clan members also bore expressions of excitement.

The Demon Clan’s people were equally elated, their faces showing determination. A sacred herb—any faction would desire it.

“Who in the world would put such a rare treasure up for auction? Did they lose their minds?” Diao Dedu sneered, speaking softly.

“Smack!” As Diao Dedu’s words finished, his body collapsed onto the ground with a thud and a series of sounds.

“Little bastard! That was my item for auction! The materials needed for the Dragon Ancestor’s awakening were too vast, and I’m broke!” Diao Yuanshan’s voice echoed in Luotian’s ears, causing the group to be stunned.

“Indeed, Diao Yuanshan, the elder truly found such a world-shaking sacred herb!” Luotian and his companions marveled. Diao Yuanshan’s strength was undeniable; such a sacred herb would have required a perilous journey. That he had managed to obtain it was proof of his immense power.

“Unfortunately, auctioned items can’t be retrieved. That’s a rule set by the eight sacred clans. Otherwise, I’d have given it to you, since you’re the Dragon Ancestor’s elder brother!” Hearing Luotian’s apparent desperation for the Eternal Life and Death Bamboo, Diao Yuanshan’s voice carried a hint of apology.

Luotian smiled, understanding that Diao Yuanshan was likely guarding it somewhere. He raised his hands in a respectful bow toward the void: “No need to apologize, elder. If it were given freely, I’d feel guilty. Let me purchase it myself!”

“Good. Bid as high as you like. I’ll just return the materials to you in the end!” Diao Yuanshan’s voice carried admiration before falling silent.

“This Eternal Life and Death Bamboo has a starting bid of ten billion spiritual energy stones. Alternatively, it can be exchanged for an equivalent sacred herb. The elder who brought it up said if you have the Heaven-Extreme Seven魂 Flowers, they can be exchanged directly,” Feng Yuanqing said with respect, his voice echoing through the auction hall.

“Fifteen billion… and I’m willing to exchange five hundred middle-grade sacred elixirs!” Someone from a domain spoke first.

“Pfah, with such pitiful resources, you dare to buy the Eternal Life and Death Bamboo? Thirty billion, plus five hundred middle-grade sacred elixirs!” The Demon Clan spoke with disdain.

Upon hearing the Demon Clan’s bid, a wave of gasps rippled through the venue. Some faces showed disappointment, knowing they were out of contention.

“Demon Clan really have big mouths! Fifty billion and three sacred artifacts, plus a thousand middle-grade sacred elixirs!” Nan Gong Yuyuqing sneered after Luotian’s signal, announcing the price.

“Hiss… The entire hall erupted in gasps of astonishment, their faces filled with awe as they gazed at the幽冥鬼貂 Clan’s private room.

Chapter 944: Pseudo-Era Treasure()

The auction hall was entirely focused on the幽冥鬼貂 Clan’s private room, their gazes filled with surprise. They hadn’t expected Diao Dedu to have such a bold move, and also secretly marveled at how much Diao Yuanshan doted on him.

“Diao Dedu, you think this is enough?” Feng Jiutian mocked loudly before announcing his bid: “One thousand middle-grade sacred elixirs, one thousand middle-grade sacred elixirs, three sacred artifacts, and a single feather from the Phoenix Clan!”

“Unbelievable! Invaluable!” The crowd erupted in applause, marveling at the sacred clan’s depth.

“Just adding some flair. After all, this is something stored by the Demon Domain! The final price will surely be even more outrageous!” Sun Hewei’s face bore a hint of disdain as he surveyed the eight sacred clans’ private rooms without speaking, knowing this was just a warm-up.

Other domains also bid fiercely. The prices soared to an unbelievable level under the crowd’s astonished gazes.

“One drop of the Dragon Ancestor’s essence!” Luotian smiled slightly, announcing his bid and causing another wave of astonishment.

This was the best Luotian could offer. He knew compared to these major factions, he was just a pauper.

“What? Dragon Ancestor’s essence! That kid actually has it!” In a secluded courtyard, eight elders bore expressions of shock. Their vast spiritual awareness formed a hurricane, scanning Luotian’s body as if to examine him thoroughly.

These eight were the strongest in the Demon Domain. After the Chaos Domain’s chaos, the Dragon War Tian had fallen, preserving the Demon Domain’s tradition. After countless years of growth, the Demon Domain had birthed eight Supreme Beasts at the peak of their power. Among them, Diao Yuanshan was the strongest—his single-handed effort had preserved the幽冥鬼貂 Clan’s status among the eight sacred clans.

Luotian took two steps back, his hair standing on end. A sense of helplessness surged within him.

“An immense power! Absolutely an immense power!” Luotian’s heart trembled, his eyes filled with terror.

“What are you doing?” In the secluded courtyard, Diao Yuanshan’s face bore coldness. His gaze swept over the seven elders, causing them to immediately halt their spiritual awareness.

“Diao Brother, this kid has Dragon Ancestor’s essence. We must investigate thoroughly. If it truly relates to the Dragon Ancestor, and if we can revive him, that would be a great blessing for the Demon Domain!” One elder, the current Dragon Ancestor, spoke with joy.

Diao Yuanshan observed their gazes and flashed a hint of mockery before coldly speaking: “This kid I’ve met. He only obtained one drop of Dragon Ancestor’s essence by chance!”

The Phoenix Clan elder’s gaze was deep, scanning Diao Yuanshan before naturally disbelieving his words: “We all hope the Dragon Ancestor still lives. I think we should investigate further!”

As the Phoenix Clan elder’s words finished, several others echoed his approval.

“You don’t trust me? Investigate if you like. But this kid is good with my grandson. I also plan to take him as a disciple. If anyone dares harm him, don’t blame me for turning against you!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore a coldness as he surveyed the seven elders before falling silent. His meaning was clear: investigate if you wish, but don’t harm this kid.

Diao Yuanshan’s strength was evident. The seven elders, wary of him, remained in place with their own thoughts while their spiritual awareness continuously swept the auction hall, unintentionally scanning Luotian.

“I’ve used a weapon once by our Celestial Clan’s Divine King! It surpasses sacred artifacts, its power not quite matching an Era Treasure but far superior to ordinary sacred artifacts. It can be called a Pseudo-Era Treasure!” Sun Hewei announced his bid, his face filled with confidence. Yet he felt a pang of reluctance.

“The Celestial Clan’s Divine King! A mighty sage, the items he forged surpass sacred artifacts!” The crowd bore awe. They marveled at the Celestial Clan’s depth, as even a Pseudo-Era Treasure was presented. Compared to the Eternal Life and Death Bamboo, this Era Treasure was of greater value.

Light flared. A powerful pressure instantly rose throughout the auction hall, as a golden longbow appeared before the crowd’s eyes.

Some Supreme Beasts and Supreme-level masters bore expressions of fear, forcing themselves to suppress the urge to kneel.

Epoch level. All nine domains’ cultivators dream of reaching this stage. Legends say that the Epoch level is the legendary Immortality Stage. Cultivating to the Epoch level means immortality and eternal life, equaling the heavens in longevity. Once a Supreme Beasts reaches their limit, they cannot act; they consume life essence and accelerate aging. But the Epoch level does not—completely like the heavens.

The golden longbow shimmered with flowing symbols, its holy appearance evident.

This bow was originally carried by Sun Hewei of the Celestial Clan for emergencies. With this bow, Sun Hewei was confident that even a Supreme Beasts at their peak could be defeated with one shot, leaving them no choice but to flee.

Seeing the Eternal Life and Death Bamboo, Sun Hewei longed to obtain it. If he did, refining a sacred elixir could prolong the Divine King’s life, possibly changing Su Mengru’s fate.

The hall fell silent. Everyone knew that with this Pseudo-Era Treasure, no one could match Sun Hewei’s longbow unless they also produced a Pseudo-Era Treasure.

Luotian was also shaken. His gaze locked onto the longbow, realizing he couldn’t afford it—it was too precious.

“Kid, give up. I’ll just go to that place again and cut down another bamboo!” Diao Dedu sighed, knowing he himself possessed a Pseudo-Era Treasure and understanding its power.

Luotian shook his head helplessly. He spoke solemnly: “Elder, tell me where you harvested the Eternal Life and Death Bamboo. Once I have strength, I’ll go there myself!”

“Hmph. When we meet again, we’ll go together. That will increase our chances!” Diao Yuanshan’s voice carried a hint of apology.

“Sold!” Feng Yuanqing shouted, hammering the deal and finalizing this outrageous transaction.

Sun Hewei showed no regret. He sealed the golden longbow, personally delivered it to the stage, and carefully stored the Eternal Life and Death Bamboo.

“Next, we’ll auction the second-to-last item of this auction!” As people were still in awe, Feng Yuanqing spoke, his voice still high.

Everyone bore expectant gazes toward Feng Yuanqing. The third-to-last item was a sacred herb, and the second-to-last—unknown if it would be even more outrageous.

“This second-to-last item is also comparable to an Immortal Herb. The reason it’s called comparable is because this second-to-last item, like the longbow exchanged for an Immortal Herb, is also a Pseudo-Era Treasure!” Feng Qingshan spoke, sending the auction into another frenzy.

A Pseudo-Era Treasure! Normally unseen, it’s a treasure of great sects. Today alone, two such treasures had been seen.

“Don’t get too excited. This Pseudo-Era Treasure, although called an Era Treasure, has flaws!” Feng Yuanqing calmly waved his hand, pulling back the red cloth. A shell-like object appeared before the crowd’s eyes—like a shield.

Yet people were surprised; this shell had no fluctuations. It just seemed old, far inferior to the longbow Sun Hewei had presented.

“Everyone has seen it. This shell has no fluctuations. It’s not that the shell isn’t powerful. My Phoenix Clan elder judged this shell was sealed by an ultimate method. If one could break the seal, this shell would be a Pseudo-Era Treasure—or even greater!” Feng Yuanqing spoke with regret, his voice soft.

“Hmph…” Upon hearing Feng Yuanqing’s words, people snorted, their wild expressions cooling down.

“Mocking us? The method to seal a Pseudo-Era Treasure is so outrageous, who could break it?” Diao Dedu sneered, snorting.

Others also shook their heads, showing no interest. Since the Demon Domain had put it up for auction, they obviously couldn’t break the shell’s seal. If even the Demon Domain couldn’t, who could?

But Luotian’s expression slightly changed. The ancient voice of the Epoch Book in his mind echoed: “Buy it, no matter the cost!”

“Huh?” Luotian knew the old man in the Epoch Book was an immense presence, closely related to the Nine Saints of the Mortal Domain. He was among the oldest in the nine domains, without a doubt. Luotian even suspected that the old man had been an Epoch-level sage in his time.

“Absolutely not simple!” Luotian muttered quietly. The fact that this ordinary-looking shell had awakened the presence in the Epoch Book meant it was definitely not as simple as it seemed. It could very well be a legendary Era Treasure.

“This Epoch Treasure starts at one hundred billion spiritual energy stones!” Feng Yuanqing announced, beginning the bidding.

But as Feng Yuanqing’s words fell, there was a brief silence. No one bid immediately, all watching each other, too hesitant to gamble.

“Valuable for collection. The seal on it is worth exploring. One hundred and fifty billion spiritual energy stones!” Zhou Wei smiled, announcing a price.

“Too little. One hundred billion spiritual energy stones, plus three sacred artifacts, and one thousand middle-grade sacred elixirs!” Luotian smiled, seeing no one bid. He felt relieved; if other major factions had bid, it would have been problematic.

“Haha, one hundred billion spiritual energy stones, four sacred artifacts, and fifteen hundred middle-grade sacred elixirs!” Just as Luotian felt relieved, Feng Jiutian’s mocking voice echoed, causing Luotian and the others to frown slightly.

Chapter 946: Who Will Win?

In the Demon Domain’s Holy City auction, seven red lights flashed with powerful fluctuations, instantly appearing before Feng Yuanqing. Without a word, blood-red hands carried overwhelming power, grabbing the golden box Feng Yuanqing held.

“Supreme Beasts at the middle stage!” Luotian narrowed his eyes, a strong sense of caution in them. These seven figures gave him an ominous feeling.

Everyone was stunned, even the Celestial Clan elder Sun Hewei hadn’t reacted. He hadn’t expected anyone to dare challenge the eight sacred clans in the Holy City.

“Who are these people!” Everyone’s eyes bore shock, sensing the power of Supreme Beasts at the middle stage. They dared not speak.

“Daring so much, to dare cause trouble in the Holy City! Since the city was established, you’re the first!” As he spoke, Feng Hongzhi appeared in people’s sight. At the same time, seven figures emerged—representatives of the eight sacred clans. One clan replaced the幽冥鬼貂 Clan’s position, blocking the entire auction hall.

Feng Hongzhi and seven others had four Supreme Beasts at the late stage, and four at the middle stage. Their power was immense. Yet these seven blood-red figures flashed red eyes, instantly seizing the golden box in Feng Yuanqing’s hands.

“Shura Domain! Indeed bold to dare challenge the Demon Domain!” Sun Hewei protected his clan’s people, eyes filled with admiration as he gazed at the seven Supreme Beasts at the middle stage.

“Shura Domain! This is the Shura Domain’s people? Legends say they are all ruthless to extremes, surviving by strength. Even the Chaos Domain fears their ferocity! They do as they please!” Upon hearing Sun Hewei’s words, the crowd erupted in chaos. Their gazes turned to the seven blood-red figures who had seized the box.

“Stole it, but can you take it away?” Feng Hongzhi’s face bore coldness as he gazed at the seven figures wrapped in red light.

They had been careless before, never expecting anyone to dare cause trouble in their Demon Domain’s Holy City. Even the Celestial Clan hadn’t had such audacity.

“Leave? Who can stop us?” Cold voices, devoid of emotional fluctuations. The seven figures moved, forming an endless sea of blood, rushing toward Feng Hongzhi with decisive intent.

“Indeed bold Shura Domain people! They chose the strongest Feng Hongzhi as their breakthrough!” A Star Domain Supreme Beasts at the middle stage elder sighed, gazing at the seven Shura Domain figures rushing toward Feng Hongzhi.

The seven Shura Domain people were in sync, as if one person. They simultaneously formed the same hand seal, blood-red symbols forming into long dragons, attacking Feng Hongzhi with overwhelming fluctuations.

“Hmph!” Feng Hongzhi was a Supreme Beasts at the late stage and the powerful Phoenix Clan leader. Facing seven Supreme Beasts at the middle stage, he showed no fear. His red light flashed, flames surged, and a fiery phoenix image emerged with infinite holiness. It clashed with the bloodstorm formed by the seven people.

The thunderous explosion was overwhelming, instantly掀开 the auction hall and revealing a deep blue sky.

Numerous buildings collapsed. The entire auction hall had people spitting blood, as most attendees were Supreme Beasts. Yet against the fluctuations of a Supreme Beasts at the late stage, they couldn’t resist. Though the fluctuations didn’t kill them, countless people were severely injured.

At the same time, the other seven clan leaders also bore cold glares. They unleashed various martial arts, forming seven overwhelming dragons toward the Shura Domain’s seven people.

Luotian and others stood tens of thousands of feet away from the auction hall, their faces filled with admiration. They marveled at the power of a Supreme Beasts at the late stage and the strength and audacity of the Shura Domain people.

“Hmph… Shura Domain, daring to challenge us in our Demon Domain!” In the Holy City’s secluded courtyard, eight Supreme Beasts at the peak level bore cold expressions. Their vast spiritual awareness formed an invisible flood, pressing toward the Shura Domain’s seven people.

“Diao Yuanshan, long time no see. You’ve reached the half-Era stage! That’s truly surprising!” A strange voice echoed, carrying a hint of surprise.

From the void, an ancient voice appeared in the courtyard. At the same time, the eight people’s spiritual awareness storm was blocked, causing Diao Yuanshan’s eyes to narrow slightly. His gaze flashed with intense light, and his aura instantly rose, emitting a dangerous atmosphere.

“Shura Domain’s leader, Yan Xiuluo. What do you mean? Want to start a war with the Demon Domain?” Diao Yuanshan’s voice carried dominance. He instantly held a crystalline green tower in his hand, gazing at the old man who appeared before the eight people.

“Diao Brother has reached the half-Era stage!” Other clan elders bore expressions of shock, gazing at Diao Yuanshan with admiration.

Seven Supreme Beasts at the peak level. Though they still had long lifespans, they were nearing their limits. At that time, they wouldn’t dare act recklessly. Diao Yuanshan had reached the half-Era stage—legendary Era stage, which could match the heavens in longevity. Though it was just half-Era, he completely dominated these Supreme Beasts at the peak.

“Hmph. The half-Era stage is indeed troublesome. I don’t want to start a war with the Demon Domain, but that page of the Epoch Book is too tempting! I believe Diao Yuanshan also reached the half-Era stage through that page of the Epoch Book! I want to enter the Era stage, and only by comprehending the Epoch Book can I do so!” Yan Xiuluo smiled.

“Even if we are both at the half-Era stage, do you think you can stop me?” Diao Dedu sneered, his aura reaching terrifying limits.

“Indeed I can’t stop you. But I can delay you for a while!” Yan Xiuluo smiled, raising his hand. Nine blood-red banners flew from his hands, instantly surrounding the entire courtyard with a flood of blood energy.

Yan Xiuluo’s hand glowed. A string of blood-red symbols instantly flew from his hands into the nine banners.

“Shura’s Unparalleled Array!” Yan Xiuluo roared, blood energy surging. The entire courtyard was surrounded, trapping Diao Yuanshan and the eight people within.

“With this array, my years of half-Era stage cultivation should keep you from leaving for a while!” Yan Xiuluo smiled confidently.

“Kill!” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes turned cold. His body radiated purple light, forming a terrifying purple fox that instantly appeared before Yan Xiuluo.

The seven Supreme Beasts at the peak level did the same. Though they had some disagreements, against other domains’ provocations, the Demon Domain was always strong and united.

“Haha, come on! Let me test the Demon Domain’s strength!” Yan Xiuluo laughed, transforming into a blood-red dragon. Using the Shura’s Unparalleled Array, he fought against Diao Yuanshan and the eight people. The overwhelming fluctuations shook the entire Holy City.

Meanwhile, Feng Hongzhi’s battle reached its peak. Thunderous sounds echoed constantly. The seven Shura Domain warriors bore pale faces.

“Haha, wanting to challenge our Demon Domain? You Shura Domain aren’t worthy!” Feng Hongzhi’s face bore mockery, gazing at the seven Shura Domain warriors wrapped in blood energy.

“Kill…” The seven exchanged glances, forming another bloodstorm. They rushed toward Feng Hongzhi again, attempting to break through his defenses.

“Damn!” Feng Hongzhi’s face was pale. The seven repeatedly drained him, even a Supreme Beasts at the late stage couldn’t sustain it. At this moment, Feng Hongzhi was in poor condition.

“Powerful! These seven Shura Domain warriors are stronger than ordinary Supreme Beasts at the middle stage. Combined, they’re even more formidable. This is Feng Hongzhi; if it were an ordinary Supreme Beasts at the late stage, they would have already been defeated!” Luotian marveled, gazing at the thunderous battlefield. A surge of热血 surged within him, wanting to join the battle.

“Do you think we’re decorations?” The other seven clan leaders bore cold expressions. Seeing the seven people hadn’t treated them seriously, they showed anger.

“Roar…” A low roar echoed. Including Feng Hongzhi, eight clan leaders transformed into their true forms, enveloping the Shura Domain people. A golden dragon surged skyward—Dragon Clan leader Long Wannian.

A fiery phoenix slowly rose. Feng Hongzhi also couldn’t withstand it, transforming into a fire phoenix and rushing toward the seven with infinite flames.

“Transformed into their true forms?” One of the leaders looked with admiration, gazing at Feng Hongzhi and others who had transformed.

“Waiting for you to transform into your true forms! Scatter!” The seven blood-red streaks instantly flew in seven directions upon the eight clan leaders’ transformation.

“Seven Star Shura Flash!” The seven Supreme Beasts at the middle stage instantly grew in size. They simultaneously spat out a mouthful of essence blood, their speed surpassing the middle stage Supreme Beasts. Even a late-stage Supreme Beasts couldn’t react in time.

“Want to escape!” Feng Hongzhi’s eyes flashed with coldness. Infinite flames burned through space, instantly sealing the entire area.

The seven clan leaders also unleashed powerful martial arts to seal the space. Their techniques were overwhelming, capable of annihilating middle-stage Supreme Beasts and leaving people trembling.

But in the next moment, the eight clan leaders’ faces turned angry. Before them, seven blood-red figures formed a blood-red shield, blocking their martial arts. The shield shattered, and the seven spat out mouthfuls of blood. Yet in the stunned gazes of Feng Hongzhi and others, they tore through space and escaped their封锁.

“Damn it! Catch them! They must have been wounded, they can’t escape. First catch the leader—The Epoch Book page is with him!”

With a command, a deep roar echoed through the Holy City. As Feng Hongzhi’s order was given, all the beasts in the city stirred. A surge of fierce energy rose instantly, even including Supreme Beasts that broke through the domain’s boundaries.

Luotian’s eyes flashed with purple light. His gaze turned to the void outside, his heart secretly glad: “Opportunity!”

Chapter 947: Pursuing the Shura Domain’s Warriors

In the Demon Domain’s Holy City, eight sacred clan leaders bore expressions of extreme frustration. They hadn’t expected the seven Shura Domain warriors to escape, and even more so, they had done it under their noses. They possessed four Supreme Beasts at the late stage, and although they were certain these seven had been wounded, they still felt humiliation.

“Pursue!” The eight leaders’ massive true forms instantly burst out of the domain, heading in seven directions.

Luotian’s eyes flashed with intense purple light. A hint of excitement appeared in his gaze. The Holy City was now in chaos. These seven Shura Domain warriors had also been wounded, their strength definitely inferior to his. If he seized this opportunity, before the Demon Domain’s people, he could find and take the one holding the Epoch Book page, placing it in his hands unnoticed.

“Diao Brother, help me find someone! We’ll be back soon!” Luotian addressed the group. His hands emitted golden symbols, enveloping himself as he activated the teleportation technique, instantly appearing with Diao Dedu outside the Holy City’s stars.

“Find the one with a red mole on their forehead!” Luotian instructed Diao Dedu. Though he had seen the direction the person fled, it had been too long, and his eyes could no longer detect their path.

Diao Dedu’s face bore a hint of seriousness. He didn’t ask further, knowing Luotian had his plans. Instantly transforming into his true form—a black-nosed fox—he sniffed deeply, his eyes flashing with purple symbols, gazing intently.

“There!” Diao Dedu extended a claw, pointing. A purple light streaked instantly and vanished.

“Indeed, the幽冥鬼貂 Clan is unparalleled. Even without using the幽冥鬼步 technique, their speed is this fast!” Luotian marveled, secretly praising the幽冥鬼貂 Clan’s unique advantages. His feet surged with wind, and the幽冥鬼步 technique instantly activated, his body vanishing as he chased after Diao Dedu.

……

“Boom….” Thunderous sounds still echoed in the Holy City, terrifying fluctuations spreading throughout it. People were puzzled about where the battle continued.

“It’s the elders’ secluded courtyard!” Someone finally saw the central area of the Holy City, a place wrapped in blood energy. It was astonishing.

“Someone dared to attack our Demon Domain’s elders!” People bore fear, never expecting anyone in the nine domains to dare challenge the Demon Domain’s eight Supreme Beasts. They were masters of the peak stage!

“Haha, my people have already left. I won’t play with you anymore!” Yan Xiuluo’s face was pale, laughing loudly. His gaze carried admiration for the eight Demon Domain leaders’ strength. He had fought hard to hold them back, paying a considerable price.

“Yan Xiuluo, today’s incident I’ll remember. When time allows, I’ll personally visit the Shura Domain. Today you’ve slapped our Demon Domain. If we don’t retaliate, then our years of existence would be meaningless! Wait for it—wait for my Demon Domain’s army to descend!” Diao Yuanshan spoke strongly, knowing he couldn’t stop Yan Xiuluo now. His face was grim.

“Haha, Diao Yuanshan, you still need to find us first!” Yan Xiuluo smiled, taking a step forward. He transformed into a ball of blood light and escaped the Shura’s Unparalleled Array.

“Damn it!” The eight Supreme Beasts’ faces were grim. They watched Yan Xiuluo escape the array, wanting to chase but still being blocked for a moment. That moment was enough for him to escape.

“Diao Brother, what now?” The Phoenix Clan elder bore a look of respect, his gaze complex as he looked at Diao Dedu.

“Hope those Shura Domain people didn’t go far. Maybe someone caught them!” Diao Yuanshan’s face was also grim, his gaze deep.

……

Beyond the entrance of the Demon Domain and the Mortal Domain, a blood-red figure appeared standing there. His face was pale, but his eyes glowed with excitement. His youthful face bore bloodstains on his crimson robe.

“Several heartbeats! Once I enter the Mortal Domain, I can have freedom. Fortunately my speed was fast; otherwise, those beasts would’ve caught me!” The youth muttered to himself, a smile on his face. His feet moved swiftly toward the entrance of the Mortal Domain.

But just as he was about to reach the Mortal Domain’s entrance, two streaks of light—purple and gold—instantly appeared at the entrance. A purple fox stood beside a young man with a smile, who sighed deeply.

“After causing trouble in our Demon Domain, you think you can just leave?” Diao Dedu’s voice carried mockery as he gazed at the blood-stained youth.

The youth was startled, his face showing a hint of surprise. He hadn’t expected anyone to catch up with him despite his speed.

“Why did you know it was me!” The youth’s face bore a hint of surprise. He hadn’t spoken during the battle with Feng Hongzhi and others, nor had he used special means to transfer the Epoch Book page to his possession. He was certain that the one who seemed like a leader had no flaws, and to others, he definitely wasn’t the leader.
