But for Diao Dezhu and his companions, it was an agonizingly long period. For a month, they had not ceased for even a moment, except for necessary rest; the remainder of their time was spent moving toward the radiant light that exuded immense pressure, constantly refining their physical bodies.

Though arduous, their progress was remarkable. Now they felt their flesh had reached its peak strength. Previously, against a Provisional Epoch Lord, they could not even resist; now, they felt confident enough to match such a foe. Even against Luo Tian's physical form, they would not be outmatched.

Yet the greatest progress was made by Luo Tian and his three companions at the forefront. Their bodies radiated radiant light, halting at a distance of ten thousand zhang. They exchanged glances; the deeper they ventured, the greater the pressure became. In a month, they had only managed to reach this point.

"I cannot go further," Sun Mengru softly shook her head before sitting cross-legged on the ground.

"Senior Brother... I can still move for a while, but I doubt I'll reach the destination," Chen Zhanbiao grumbled.

"I too can push forward a little, but given the pressure's intensity, I won't last two thousand zhang," Run Hong added to Luo Tian, stating his limit.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed softly. He too felt he could not proceed further; the pressure was simply overwhelming. Their progress over the past month had been due to intermittent stops and adaptations, gradually strengthening their bodies.

But since entering twenty thousand zhang, they discovered the pressure continued to intensify—yet their bodies no longer received its refining influence. Their physical strength ceased to grow.

Still, Luo Tian marveled at the benefits of this pressure. Through its refinement, he was certain that if a Provisional Epoch Lord drew too close, his body would crush them without hesitation.

Sun Mengru, Run Hong, and Chen Zhanbiao had also significantly strengthened, though not to Luo Tian's level. After all, Luo Tian's body had always been extraordinary.

Yet even they felt unafraid against Provisional Epoch Lords, capable of inflicting considerable damage.

"I'll try," Luo Tian sighed longingly. He could not endure being trapped in the Boneshroud Palace forever.

"I'll accompany you," Run Hong smiled, then followed Luo Tian's steps. Chen Zhanbiao also strode behind him into the mist.

The three embarked on another grueling journey. Normally, a single thought could transport them to their destination—but now even Luo Tian struggled, as if burdened by a mountain.

Luo Tian fared better; as the Soul-Refining Master, his spirit was formidable, and his body surpassed Run Hong and Chen Zhanbiao.

But as time passed, Run Hong and Chen Zhanbiao grew weary, their legs trembling, sweat soaking their robes.

Two thousand zhang...
As Run Hong had predicted, after covering this distance, they dared not proceed further. They knew continuing would risk severe injury.

"Count on you!" Run Hong smiled, then extended his hand. Three silver needles shot from his palm, piercing Luo Tian's body.

"If you cannot endure, drive the three needles five fen deep; it will boost your strength," Run Hong whispered. He had followed Luo Tian to administer the needles, enabling him to persist longer.

"Good," Luo Tian nodded. Now only he remained capable of continuing, so he must succeed—otherwise they might be trapped in the third level of the Boneshroud Palace.

"Let me see what lies beyond this mist," Luo Tian's face bore determination as he strode toward the mist, now only eight thousand zhang away.

The remaining eight thousand zhang revealed vague outlines of a massive structure, though its nature remained indistinct.

"Crack..." Each step Luo Tian took was heavy, his feet leaving fine cracks on the ground.

Though his body's strength was formidable, it had limits. Upon entering five thousand zhang, his steps slowed drastically; each movement required prolonged breaths, causing concern among Sun Mengru and the others.

"What if Luo Tian cannot reach it? There's still five thousand zhang left!" Zheng Xin whispered, her voice laced with anxiety.

"Believe in Luo Tian; he's never let us down before," Xu Liyi and the others abandoned their laughter, gazing toward Luo Tian.

"You must persevere..." A distant voice echoed again, filled with encouragement.

"Buzz..." The sound faded, and Luo Tian's weary body trembled slightly. He felt an eerie magic within the voice, momentarily lessening his pressure.

"What is this technique?" Luo Tian's heart jolted but felt no joy; the more mysterious the opponent, the more he feared.

"Never mind—once I reach it, even if you are truly an immortal, I'll tear a piece from your flesh!" Luo Tian muttered coldly, striding toward the light.

The distance closed gradually; Luo Tian discerned what lay within the vast light—a colossal altar, radiating divine energy. An overwhelming aura pressed upon his mind, instilling profound fear.

This pressure differed from that of an Epoch Lord; it was intrinsic, as if he were a mere ant before the heavens. No desire to resist surfaced within him.

"Is this the aura of immortals?" Luo Tian's heart surged with emotion, though the pressure was immense. He had glimpsed something few could ever see.

"Go..." Luo Tian discarded all hesitation, stepping toward the altar again. After another two thousand zhang, he found himself in困境 once more.

"Ah..." His blood and cultivation power surged; every inch of his skin felt compressed. Facing the terrifying pressure, his body bent violently, a desire to kneel creeping over him.

"Never kneel—even if you are an immortal!" Luo Tian's forehead veins bulged. He knew that if he knelt, he might never rise again. A strange thought also surfaced: to kneel was submission; his path would only reach an Epoch Lord, never beyond.

"You must come... persevere..." The distant voice returned but failed to aid Luo Tian, who remained frozen, his body trembling violently.

"Open!" Luo Tian roared skyward. The three silver needles Run Hong had implanted five fen deep into his body surged with power.

"Boom..." A thunderous roar echoed as the needles plunged in, and Luo Tian's body erupted with fury. An invisible wave of energy rose from him, blowing his robes. His entire being radiated an overwhelming aura—a will unyielding. Though not a cultivation enhancement, his very essence had ascended; even an authentic immortal before him would fear none.

"Go..." Luo Tian growled, stepping toward the colossal altar with unwavering resolve.

"Crack..." The sound of breaking echoed repeatedly; cracks formed under his feet, and even his body bore fractures. Yet he moved steadily toward the altar.

"Luo Tian's condition is worsening—he's injured!" Seeing his body riddled with cracks, Sun Mengru and the others' concern deepened.

"One thousand zhang... five hundred... one hundred..." Time passed slowly. A distance of a thousand zhang, which would have taken a month before, was now traversed in an hour.

"I've arrived!" Luo Tian's body was bloodied, his form gaunt but eyes blazing. He gazed at the altar radiating divine light.

"You've not disappointed me!" The distant voice echoed in his ears, and radiant light surged from the altar, enveloping Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The hum resonated; a warm sensation spread over his body. His cracked flesh healed instantly, and the pressure upon him vanished.

Chapter 1608: The Origin of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword ()

Divine light enveloped him, and Luo Tian vanished beneath the altar, startling him. He then appeared atop it, a strange aura pressing upon his mind, leaving him stunned.

A sacred altar—Luo Tian felt as if he'd entered another world. Beneath his feet, laws of Dao intertwined, forming a vast net that left him in awe.

"This altar is no ordinary place; whose is it?" Luo Tian murmured, his expression grave. He scanned the surroundings but found only flowing divine laws.

"You've done well..." The distant voice returned, laced with praise, making Luo Tian's mind tense again.

"Who are you? If I've reached this place, why do you still play tricks?" Luo Tian shouted into the void.

"Buzz..." Before his voice faded, winds howled in his ears, and divine light on the altar surged. A white figure materialized several zhang away. Her long hair flowed, her pure white robes like untouched snow; her face was flawlessly exquisite.

Luo Tian gazed at the figure forming before him, momentarily entranced. This was an expression he hadn't felt in years. As he beheld her ethereal form, a single phrase surfaced in his mind: "Nine Heavens' Divine Woman Descended to Mortal Realm."

His wives were all radiant, but this woman's aura surpassed Sun Mengru and the others.

"Hello," the distant voice echoed in his ears, snapping him back to reality. His heart tightened.

The ethereal figure seemed accustomed to his earlier reaction, ignoring his impertinence and gazing at him.

"You... hello..." Luo Tian hesitated, his gaze on the figure. Though it was only an illusion, he felt immense pressure from her. Yet no hostility emanated from her.

"Are you an immortal?" Luo Tian asked softly, his eyes burning with curiosity.

"Immortal... perhaps I am what you call an immortal. But it's nothing special—I'm merely a residual consciousness. My true self has already perished!" The woman sighed, her eyes tinged with sorrow.

"Perished... dead..." Luo Tian's heart surged with waves of shock; who in the Nine Realms could kill an immortal?

"I'll show you something—then you'll know!" The woman sighed, raising her hand. A surge of energy radiated from it, striking Luo Tian's body.

"Buzz..." The sound echoed as a green sword flew from Luo Tian's storage ring, emitting ten thousand zhang of green light. Green lightning surrounded it as it flew toward the woman.

"How is this possible!" Luo Tian's face contorted, watching the sword approach her—Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"You've grown weak over these years, haven't you? The Heavenly Dao Sect's revered treasure, the middle-tier immortal artifact Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword—how could it have fallen so low..." The woman sighed, her translucent hand gently caressing the sword, her gaze soft.

"Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword... an immortal artifact?" Luo Tian's lips twitched; if this woman weren't so intimidating, he'd have shouted.

He knew the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword had been weak before; only through Zhang Ziping and his two elder brothers' forging had it reached the level of a pseudo-Epoch Treasure.

If someone had told Luo Tian years ago that it was an immortal artifact, he'd have never believed it. But this woman—perhaps she truly was an immortal. That made him believe a little.

"Ten Thousand Dao Sect!" He then recalled her other words—Ten Thousand Dao Sect, the very sect they belonged to.

"Buzz..." Radiant light spread; the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword emitted a harmonious aura, trembling gently in her hands.

"Alright, since you now have a new master, it's another form of rebirth. From now on, follow your new master closely!" The woman softly comforted it before gazing at Luo Tian.

"You must have many questions, but I don't have time to explain much. Since you carry the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, you are now the sect's heir."

"I am Mei Xueyin, who entrusts the position of Sect Leader to you. From now on, you are the Ninth Generation Sect Leader of the Heavenly Dao Sect!" The woman spoke softly, her gaze solemn.

"Wait..." Luo Tian felt bewildered; this Heavenly Dao Sect leader didn't seem like a good thing.

"And your task is to transcend this world, enter the Xian World, and reclaim what belongs to the Heavenly Dao Sect!" Mei Xueyin continued without waiting for Luo Tian's response, then pointed her finger. A golden light surged into his body.

"This is the Heavenly Dao Sect's inheritance. Though it holds nothing, only one sword technique, it's enough to make you an unparalleled strength in this world. The rest of your path must be walked alone!" Mei Xueyin spoke softly, her voice tinged with regret.

As the light entered his mind, Luo Tian's face bore a bitter expression.

"Is that all?" Luo Tian's lips twitched, gazing at the ethereal Mei Xueyin. He couldn't help but ask.

"I know it's difficult for you, so I won't force you. If your strength isn't enough, don't reveal your identity. If exposed, future entry into the Xian World might mean this world cannot contain you!" Mei Xueyin spoke softly.

"Such a great inheritance..." Luo Tian's lips twitched, feeling as if he'd been tricked. Mei Xueyin's inheritance was only a single sword technique, with the rest being memory fragments.

Then Luo Tian began sorting through the memories in his mind, his face showing shock.

The first scene: a golden mountain stood amidst the heavens and earth, like a pillar of the world. Just this mountain alone filled Luo Tian with immense pressure.

On top of it stood many figures, their bodies glowing gold, their auras overwhelming and filled with battle intent. Opposite them stood figures in golden robes, their gazes cold.

"Ordered by the Eternal Life Immortal King, Heavenly Dao Sect—annihilated!" A deep and cold voice echoed through the heavens. The moment it spoke, overwhelming killing intent radiated from those in golden robes.

"Kill..." The battle erupted; both sides clashed, but it was one-sided slaughter. Golden blood stained the golden mountain, and the world darkened with their clash.

Luo Tian's heart trembled as he watched both sides fight. Though the battle wasn't grand, he felt a profound danger from either side; neither would he be able to match.

The scene shifted, revealing a man and woman's figures in his mind. Both were bloodied, their faces pale. The woman held a green sword, surrounded by seven-colored lightning—except for her aura, everything else was nearly identical to the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword is truly an immortal artifact!" Luo Tian's heart trembled; he could now guess the world he'd seen was the legendary Xian World.

Though just a memory fragment, Luo Tian could sense this world differed fundamentally from the Nine Realms. In the Nine Realms, an Epoch Peak could destroy a star or continent; yet in that world, those figures had not even shattered the golden mountain.

"Ah, truly a beauty of the Xian World. But you Heavenly Dao Sect remnants—none shall escape!" A mocking voice echoed as several golden-robed immortals surrounded the man and woman. The woman was identical to Mei Xueyin's ethereal form, while the man's figure seemed familiar.

"Little Sister, you go first; I'll hold them off!" The man urged Mei Xueyin, pushing her away. His face was wild as he charged at the black-cloaked attackers.

"Senior Brother..." Mei Xueyin's face also bore wildness, gripping the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and following the man.

"You must go!" The man roared, his voice filled with anger at her not obeying.

"But..." Mei Xueyin halted, her face filled with reluctance. They had been childhood friends; she knew what the man intended.

"Don't say 'but,' don't let me die in vain!" The young man growled, and as he spoke, several attackers pierced his shoulder. Blood gushed from it.

"Senior Brother, take care!" Mei Xueyin gritted her teeth, then waved her hand. She pushed the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword into the man's hands before wiping tears from her face and fleeing.

Though the young man was already at a disadvantage, with the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, his strength surged.

"With my残躯 (frail body), I wield the Heavenly Punishment!" The young man gazed at Mei Xueyin's departure, a bitter smile on his face. His cold voice echoed as he faced the attackers.

"Crash..." Seven-colored lightning erupted from the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, and the young man's long hair flew. His eyes bore madness.

"What is this Eternal Life Immortal King? If I had one epoch, I'd storm the Eternal Life Mountain!" His voice echoed with arrogance.

Chapter 1609: Repairing the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword ()

A violent surge of energy radiated from the young man, terrifying pressure making those who attacked him grimace.

"Damn it, he's about to self-destruct the middle-tier immortal artifact!" They realized instantly and scattered.

"Can't escape!" The young man's face was cold, then a terrifying explosion echoed through the heavens. A world-shattering surge spread outward, instantly engulfing those who tried to flee. Seven-colored storms swept up.

The world trembled for a moment, and the seven-colored storm finally calmed. A seven-colored sword-shaped illusion was swept into a crack.

"Senior Brother..." Mei Xueyin's face bore sorrow, her gaze filled with death.

"Damn it..." The scene ended as Mei Xueyin fled, but Luo Tian's heart trembled. He felt truly tricked.

That Eternal Life Immortal King was clearly no good. Even those who chased Mei Xueyin were extremely powerful; if they descended to the Nine Realms, they could easily crush it.

"Later, I never escaped; I was chased to the point of no escape. Finally, I took a desperate risk and burned my body, crossing over here. Though I escaped the chase, I was still exhausted, leaving only this residual consciousness to await a worthy heir."

"You carry the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, which awakened my residual consciousness. You have a connection with the Heavenly Dao Sect; though I don't know how you obtained it, now that you have, there's a karmic bond!" Mei Xueyin spoke softly, her voice gentle.

"Previously, your ascent to this altar was a test. Your friends' high regard for you shows your character is decent; reaching here proves your talent is acceptable. Though not as exceptional as some geniuses, your talent and character can compensate somewhat!" Mei Xueyin spoke again, making Luo Tian's lips twitch.

"More than just connected—I was already a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect. I wonder if the Heavenly Dao Sect on Tianyuan Continent has any relation to yours!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

Then he recalled Mei Xueyin's other words—'talent is acceptable.' He felt reluctant; he was a reincarnated soul, and how many could match him in the Nine Realms? Why did Mei Xueyin see his strength as ordinary, even though she was an immortal?

"Don't be reluctant. The rules of this world are like that. I've seen others who ascended from other worlds to the Xian World; in their own world, they were mighty. But once in the Xian World, they were suppressed by its rules and eventually faded!" Mei Xueyin spoke again, her gaze filled with a smile.

"Fine," Luo Tian's face fell upon hearing Mei Xueyin's words, recalling the powerful figures in the earlier scene. None were weak.

"Respected Elder, do you know Zhang Daotian?" Luo Tian then recalled his question. He wondered if the Heavenly Dao Sect on Tianyuan Continent had any connection to the Xian World's. If so, it would be too coincidental.

"Zhang Daotian?" Mei Xueyin's brows slightly furrowed, then her eyes softened. "He was my elder brother!"

"What?" Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief, his voice barely containing shock. Even if she was an immortal, he couldn't help but shout.

"What's wrong?" Mei Xueyin looked at Luo Tian's changed expression, her eyes filled with confusion. She didn't understand why he reacted so strongly.

"Respected Elder, Zhang Daotian is my master!" Luo Tian's gaze held a bitter smile as he spoke to Mei Xueyin.

"How could that be? My elder brother self-destructed a middle-tier immortal artifact, and he died with the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. How could he..." Mei Xueyin, a mere illusion, also bore disbelief in her eyes.

"It's too coincidental. My master is Zhang Daotian, the sole disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect. Another Xian World also has a Heavenly Dao Sect; this so-called sect leader, Elder Brother Zhang Daotian, is the same name!" Luo Tian felt confused.

He had once sensed Zhang Daotian's youth in the Ancient Xian Ruins; at that time, the Heavenly Dao Sect already existed, and the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword was present. He couldn't fathom any connection between them.

"If I'm not mistaken, something changed during my elder brother's self-destruction!" Mei Xueyin spoke softly, her voice tinged with joy.

"If my elder brother is indeed the same person, then this woman must be my aunt!" Luo Tian thought to himself, gazing at Mei Xueyin's ethereal form with reverence.

"You've truly escaped now. If you ascend to the Xian World, you'll inevitably clash with them. I hope you can help the Heavenly Dao Sect reestablish itself in the Xian World!"

"Originally, our Heavenly Dao Sect was renowned in the Xian World. The Heavenly Dao Mountain was one of the Nine Immortal Mountains, and my father was one of the Nine Immortal Kings. However, after my father's death, another mountain took advantage to destroy our Heavenly Dao Sect!" Mei Xueyin's face bore hatred; clearly, she felt guilty for the sect's destruction.

"Respected Aunt, don't feel guilty. No sect lasts forever. Since my master and the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword still exist, our Heavenly Dao Sect remains. As long as the inheritance isn't broken, there's hope. Though this Eternal Life Immortal King is strong, I believe one day I'll confront my master and reestablish the Heavenly Dao Sect!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice resolute.

"I finally understand why my elder brother took you as a disciple. You two were very similar when young!" Mei Xueyin smiled, not feeling the least bit embarrassed at Luo Tian calling her 'Respected Aunt.' In her heart, she and Zhang Daotian were already a couple.

"Unfortunately, I'm dead. Otherwise, I could have guided your cultivation!" Mei Xueyin's voice carried regret.

"Path is walked by oneself," Luo Tian sighed softly. If he had previously resisted this so-called inheritance, now he was truly the Heavenly Dao Sect's heir. Zhang Daotian hadn't lived another life yet; only he and his three brothers remained in the sect. The responsibility naturally fell upon them.

"Still, confidence is good. If you ever enter the Xian World, be patient. The Xian World is far crueler than you imagine. If you declare yourself a Heavenly Dao Sect disciple, countless strong ones will chase you, just like us!" Mei Xueyin's gaze carried sorrow.

"Never declare yourself a Heavenly Dao Sect disciple until you reach the Immortal King level!" Mei Xueyin reiterated.

"Ah! Respected Aunt, is there anything else you want to tell my master?" Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at the illusion.

"Tell him I'm dead and let him live well!" Mei Xueyin sighed, though she was only a residual consciousness, her sorrow still lingered.

"Your path will be very difficult. After I leave this altar, you can exit the Boneshroud Palace from the fourth level. Don't go deeper; I felt a terrifying fluctuation in the depths of this bone forest, and the fourth level also has a strong fluctuation. If I were alive, I wouldn't fear it, but you must rely on yourself! My residual consciousness has nothing to give you!"

"Even if I gave it to you, it wouldn't help. Cultivation relies on one step at a time; sudden power boosts are no good for you!"

"You can etch the altar's patterns. These patterns are our Heavenly Dao Sect's map. If you ever enter the Xian World, on the Heavenly Dao Mountain lies a legacy left by my father, the Fallen Heaven Immortal King. Originally, I wanted my elder brother to accept it, but he refused!" Mei Xueyin spoke again.

"Lastly, I can do is repair the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword a little! It should reach the level of an Epoch Treasure!" Mei Xueyin smiled, as if relieved. Her form shimmered with divine light, then a beam of light surged into the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed from the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, and immediately, green lightning erupted from it, spreading outward.

As the green lightning burst forth, golden lightning also surged out, and the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword's aura gradually rose. An overwhelming aura made Luo Tian's eyes gleam with joy.

"When you face a thunderstorm, use the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword to defend yourself. If this sword can absorb lightning storms and produce seven-colored lightning, it will become a lower-tier immortal artifact. To ascend to middle-tier, you'll need an immortal artificer!" Mei Xueyin's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, then vanished completely. The altar was now empty except for Luo Tian standing there, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword hovering above his head.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, his voice laced with helplessness. He didn't know how to tell Zhang Daotian if he awoke his memories from the Xian World that Mei Xueyin had died.

"Buzz..." As Mei Xueyin's form faded, the immense aura surrounding the arena vanished instantly, lightening the burden on Diao Dezhu and his companions.

Chapter 1610: Skeletons ()

"What's happening? The pressure is gone?" Diao Dezhu and his companions' faces changed instantly, gazing at the altar that had once been unapproachable.

As Mei Xueyin's residual form vanished, the massive altar appeared in their sight, revealing Luo Tian standing there.

"Let's go check..." Without pressure, they worried about Luo Tian's condition and moved swiftly to his side.

"Truly..." Luo Tian's face was bitter, shaking his head gently before grabbing the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"A relic of an Epoch Treasure, exchanged for a massive crisis!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his words leaving Diao Dezhu and the others confused.

"Luo Tian, did you really see an immortal?" Diao Dezhu and the others immediately grasped the key point, their faces filled with excitement as they asked Luo Tian.

"Yes... in a way," Luo Tian nodded softly, gazing at their excitement and inwardly sighed. If it were them, they wouldn't be so excited.

"Really there are immortals? My heavens! What do they look like? Are they the same as us? Are they strong?" Zheng Xin, like a curious child, gazed at Luo Tian.

"Just a residual consciousness of an immortal," Luo Tian smiled, recounting his experience on the altar. They were brothers in arms and trusted him completely; besides, this was the Nine Realms, not the Xian World. Luo Tian had no fear of exposing anything.

"Damn it, that's too harsh—just giving you a relic of an Epoch Treasure and sending you to kill an immortal king!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, they all muttered in frustration.

"Immortal King—just the name alone is no easy opponent. It's like a Provisional Epoch Lord in the Nine Realms. The Xian World won't have many of them. Sending you to kill an immortal king, they really do trust in you!" Run Hong was also speechless.

"There's no choice but to face it head-on," Luo Tian said, his expression indifferent. After all, he wasn't sure if he could become an Epoch Lord; let alone the elusive Xian World. No one in the Nine Realms had ever successfully ascended to the Xian World, not even Epoch Lords who were said to have entered it.

The only thing troubling Luo Tian was Gu Qianxue; she had yet to be found. If what he'd heard before was true, and she had ascended during the day, how would a weak woman survive in the Xian World? He hadn't understood the Xian World before, but now he had some understanding. It was far crueler than the Nine Realms and not as idyllic as people imagined.

"I hope Qianxue didn't enter the Xian World," Luo Tian sighed deeply, his voice laced with prayer.

"Regardless, for the sake of our sect's ancient grudge and the invasion by the Ancient Kings' clan, we must enhance our strength!" Luo Tian spoke softly, rekindling his drive to improve.

"For now, let's focus on becoming an Epoch Lord. The Nine Realms haven't had anyone successfully ascend to the Xian World in so long; even Epoch Lords only produce one per epoch. There's clearly something wrong!" Run Hong smiled.

"Yes, becoming an Epoch Lord is already so difficult; how much more so to ascend to the Xian World? That's probably decades away!" Luo Tian shook his head, his gaze bitter. But no matter what, he wouldn't give up.

"By the way, Luo Tian, what's the cultivation level above an Epoch Lord? You must know, right? We can't go without a direction!" Zheng Xin and the others turned their gaze to Luo Tian, eyes filled with anticipation.

"Uh... I don't know..." Luo Tian's expression froze; he felt regretful for forgetting to ask Mei Xueyin.

"Of course I know, but you're not suitable for knowing too much now; it's no good for your cultivation!" Luo Tian's face then turned serious, unwilling to embarrass himself in front of them.

"Alright," Zheng Xin and the others nodded, their eyes showing disappointment but not too much—after all, the Xian World was too distant for them.

"Only Luo Tian can show off," Diao Dezhu muttered, watching Luo Tian's demeanor. He was familiar with this look, making Luo Tian feel awkward.

"Diao Dezhu, your body must be very strong now. Let me test how far your physical strength has progressed," Luo Tian's awkwardness faded quickly, and he produced several silver needles from his hand, smiling at Diao Dezhu.
