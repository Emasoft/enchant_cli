“Impossible! Within three days, you must find him. If not, then abandon this position!” Fu Xingxuan’s face bore a cold expression, as if she had transformed into another person entirely. She spoke to Luo Tian with an icy tone.

“Truly, she changes her face faster than flipping a page!” Luo Tian thought with a sigh. Just now, before Fu Xingyue, she had seemed like an innocent girl, but now she was as cold as ice.

“I truly cannot do it!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Fu Xingxuan, his heart sighing at how wise it had been not to reveal his true identity. If he had, he would have surely gone mad from this capricious princess.

“Fine, since you’ve taken a long leave, send someone to find him. He will return eventually!” Fu Xingyue spoke to Fu Xingxuan, who was persistently demanding.

“Impossible! Then let him find it himself!” Fu Xingxuan ignored Fu Xingyue’s words entirely, still speaking.

“If I could, I would have Mengchen go out right now. However, seven days later is the Grand Martial Competition of the Three Armies. If my chief commander leaves, how can I compete with my elder brother and third brother? Be good, after the competition, I will have Mengchen personally search for him. Is that acceptable?” Fu Xingyue spoke in a conciliatory manner to Fu Xingxuan.

Chapter 1297: The Grand Martial Competition of the Three Armies

“Grand Martial Competition of the Three Armies?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of confusion, his gaze turning to Fu Xingyue.

“This is why I called you here—firstly, to request your assistance in finding someone. Secondly, I wish to discuss the details of this Grand Martial Competition with you.”

“You should know that our Star Moon Divine City has three major armies. These are controlled by the three of us brothers, and they can be said to be the lifeblood of the empire,” Fu Xingyue said with pride.

“Each of these three armies holds a grand competition at certain intervals, determining the hierarchy. The victor has a greater chance of inheriting that position,” Fu Xingyue said with a hint of admiration.

“Our Star Moon Divine Guards are the city’s guardians and my father’s trusted confidants. Thus, every competition is always first place. However, this time it's different. You are the new commander, and I also need to secure first place because my father once said he might soon step down. Therefore, this Grand Martial Competition is crucial!”

Fu Xingyue’s gaze turned to Luo Tian, a soft sigh escaping her lips.

“Such a heavy burden,” Luo Tian thought with a sigh. Though he and the Ancient King Clan were enemies, after so much time together, he still hoped Fu Xingyue would ascend the throne. It was a way to atone for Fu Xingyue’s sincerity towards him.

Additionally, Luo Tian had a grand plan: if Fu Xingyue truly became the emperor, he might attempt to persuade her not to wage war against the human race.

“This is the rule and details of the Grand Martial Competition. Return and study it carefully, trying to prepare as best as you can. Also, this is my token; you may use it to enter the Martial Skills Hall and the Techniques Hall freely, selecting any martial arts or techniques you wish,” Fu Xingyue said softly, handing Luo Tian another token.

“Yes!” Luo Tian thought with gratitude for Fu Xingyue’s kindness. He took the token and exited Fu Xingyue’s hall.

“Second brother, can’t you three stop fighting?” Seeing Luo Tian leave, Fu Xingxuan sighed lazily. Each of her three brothers loved her dearly, but she found it difficult to be caught in the middle.

“I don’t want to either. But I have no choice. If I do not compete, although I can continue being the second prince, those people behind me would not be so fortunate. Do you think if my eldest brother took the position, he would let me and my people live in peace?” Fu Xingyue sighed softly.

“Alas…” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes showed a touch of sorrow. She knew Fu Xingyue was right; any one of the three brothers ascending would first eliminate the other’s forces. No one in power could allow a threat to their position.

“I’ll leave first,” Fu Xingxuan said, somewhat unhappy. Her figure flickered and she exited the hall.

“Mengchen… I hope you don’t disappoint me. If I cannot secure this position, then I can still live on. But with my eldest brother’s nature, you may be in danger!” Fu Xingyue spoke softly, her voice echoing within the hall.

Luo Tian walked along the main road, pondering how to face the upcoming Grand Martial Competition. Originally, he had planned to go and contemplate the stone wall a few days later, but now the Grand Martial Competition was more important.

“Is it a team battle?” Luo Tian thought, then his eyes showed confidence. If it was about team battles, the Tongtian Array would be the best choice. However, he suddenly remembered that the Tongtian Array could not be used, and his face immediately fell.

“Stop!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. He instantly halted, sighing inwardly at the trouble and showing a fawning expression as he turned to face the silhouette under the moonlight.

“Demon!” Luo Tian, upon a single glance at the woman, was bewitched. After a brief moment of daze, he bowed and said: “Princess!”

“Do we know each other? I feel like I’ve seen you before!” Fu Xingxuan looked at Luo Tian with a questioning gaze, her eyes filled with scrutiny.

“Women’s intuition is truly terrifying. My wives, I did my best; it was this woman who insisted on following me!” Luo Tian thought to himself.

“Princess must have mistaken me. I’ve only just arrived in Star Moon Divine City and this is my first time meeting the princess!” Luo Tian showed a respectful expression as he spoke to Fu Xingxuan.

“Hmph. I hope so. Also, don’t think that because of the Grand Martial Competition you can neglect my matters. That Xiao Ding— you must still find him. The princess taking him as her follower is his honor, yet he dared to run away. If I catch him, I’ll peel his skin!” Fu Xingyue sneered and vanished into Luo Tian’s respectful gaze.

Seeing Fu Xingxuan leave, hearing her words, Luo Tian made up his mind. The name “Xiao Ding” could no longer be used.

“Hmph, a name is just a name. There’s Wang Ding and Zhang Ding!” Luo Tian thought to himself, walking back to his residence.

Time did not wait. That night, Luo Tian thoroughly familiarized himself with the rules of the Grand Martial Competition and then rushed to the Martial Skills Hall.

“Here, I cannot expose many of my martial arts. Fortunately, there is still enough time!” Luo Tian walked through the Martial Skills Hall, which was unusually quiet. Only with Fu Xingyue’s token did he have the right to walk here.

Luo Tian quickly became disappointed. The martial arts in the hall were all ordinary, with no particularly impressive features.

“Seems like those secret techniques are still held by the royal family!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. He grabbed a martial art called Star Roaming Hands, which he thought was the strongest in the hall.

Luo Tian directly used his token to copy it, then headed towards the Techniques Hall in hopes of luck.

Compared with the Martial Skills Hall, the Techniques Hall was mysterious. It contained a series of stone tablets of varying sizes. On each tablet were the names of techniques. Once one found a technique, they could sit down and meditate.

The Techniques Hall was also quiet. However, there were several people sitting on various stone tablets, with the tablets emitting radiant glows that illuminated the entire hall.

“Flame Spirit Secret Classic… Golden Wing Sword Scroll…” Luo Tian looked at the names on each stone tablet, overwhelmed by their variety. He shook his head lightly.

As for techniques, Luo Tian had always used the Five Elements Transformation Art. He had never changed it over these years, even after meditating on the Feathered Immortal Scripture in the Feathered Immortal Pool. He had never considered abandoning the Five Elements Transformation Art.

“Boom… Boom…” As Luo Tian walked, a deep sound echoed throughout the Techniques Hall.

The thunderous noise caused even those meditating to open their eyes, then they shook their heads with a sigh.

“Third prince is too persistent. For so many years, he still clings to that stone tablet!”

“Yes. If not for this, the third prince might have already become a power of the early era like the first and second princes!” People shook their heads, faces showing regret.

“Fu Xingchen?” Hearing the murmurs, Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly. He hadn’t expected to meet Fu Xingchen in the Techniques Hall.

Luo Tian was not familiar with Fu Xingchen, but he was interested in the technique that Fu Xingchen had failed to master for so many years.

“Third prince is also strange. He has the Star Moon Scripture but still chooses that stone tablet. It seems no one has ever succeeded in meditating on it since the stone tablet flew here!” People continued to murmur, but they noticed Luo Tian’s presence.

“Is he the commander of Star Moon Guards? Why is he here? Also, to meditate on techniques?” People started murmuring, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian with a hint of hostility.

“Hmph. I heard that Xiao Ding is a Star Moon Guard. That Xiao Ding was ungrateful, obviously his command was inadequate! And he still refuses to hand over Xiao Ding. Clearly, he wants to protect him!” People whispered lowly, making Luo Tian sigh in frustration at Fu Xingxuan’s charm.

However, these people were merely venting their anger. No one dared to do anything to Luo Tian, as his identity was clear.

Luo Tian ignored the angry gazes of the people and stepped toward the depths of the Techniques Hall. Soon, he felt an inexplicable call in his mind.

What made Luo Tian delighted was that the Chronological Book within his mind also emitted a continuous humming sound.

“There’s something good!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed excitement. According to past experiences, when the Chronological Book made a sound, it was definitely something good—something extremely powerful.

Luo Tian walked for a full hour before finally reaching the depths of the Techniques Hall. He also found Fu Xingchen’s figure.

The humming echoed, and a gray stone tablet stood before Luo Tian. The tablet was about ten zhang high, with wisps of gray mist swirling around it. A powerful aura swept over Luo Tian, making his eyes show caution.

“Who are you? Who allowed you here?” As Luo Tian marveled, Fu Xingchen suddenly turned around with a cold gaze and looked at Luo Tian.

A half-step Chronological power would be shaken by Fu Xingchen’s aura, but Luo Tian seemed to ignore Fu Xingchen’s gaze entirely. His eyes were filled with excitement as he gazed at the gray stone tablet.

“Reincarnation Heaven Art!” Luo Tian saw the four bold characters on the gray stone tablet, his mind thundering. His body emitted a continuous humming sound as the Five Elements Transformation Art automatically activated.

As Luo Tian activated the Five Elements Transformation Art, the call became even stronger.

“I asked you a question. Didn’t you hear me?” Seeing Luo Tian still standing there without responding, Fu Xingchen became angry. He extended his hand and a silver light shot out toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 1298: Reincarnation Heaven Art

The silver light instantly approached, heading toward Luo Tian. In a blink of an eye, it reached Luo Tian’s forehead, causing his mind to tremble.

Luo Tian suddenly raised his hand and extended two fingers, pinching the silver light. His mind surged with killing intent.

A silver needle landed in Luo Tian’s hand, which he clutched tightly. His gaze turned to Fu Xingchen.

“Good reflexes, you managed to dodge my attack!” Fu Xingchen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at Luo Tian, his gaze changing. He then carefully examined Luo Tian.

“Respect the Third Prince!” Luo Tian suppressed his inner killing intent. That was just himself; if it were anyone else, they would have been pierced through the soul and eliminated immediately.

“Are you the new commander given by my second brother, that Xiao Mengchen with the Fu surname?” Fu Xingchen recognized Luo Tian and sneered.

“Yes! It is your subordinate!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, his heart filled with anger but his face still showing respect.

“Give it to me!” Fu Xingchen’s face bore cold arrogance. He approached Luo Tian and did not let him rise, extending his white hand toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian remained in a slight bow. His hands were pale, and he felt Fu Xingchen’s arrogant demeanor. He really wanted to slap this Fu Xingchen into death.

“Yes!” But Luo Tian still handed the silver needle over to Fu Xingchen’s hand. His heart had already recorded this debt.

“Still sensible. Why did you come here? To meditate on techniques? Go away, this stone tablet is not for you to touch!” Fu Xingchen spoke again with a sneer.

“Third Prince, I wish to try!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed frustration. He kept muttering: “A man must know when to yield!”

“Just because you can’t meditate on it, do you think your talent is better than mine?” Fu Xingchen’s sneer deepened. He felt Luo Tian defied his command and roared angrily.

If it were any other matter, Luo Tian might have endured. But this Reincarnation Heaven Art seemed to be of great use for him, so he did not move but kept his respectful expression: “Third Prince’s talent is astonishing. Everyone in the Star Moon Divine Clan, even the entire Origin Domain knows this. But some things are only for those with fate. Perhaps I can meditate and find something, then present it to the Third Prince later. That would save the Third Prince a lot of time!”

“You dare to defy me!” Fu Xingchen’s face finally darkened. He extended his hand, and a glint of coldness flashed between his fingers—exactly the silver needle he had just sent toward Luo Tian.

“Third Prince, what are you doing? Are you going to discipline the commander of Star Moon Guards?” As Fu Xingchen was about to attack Luo Tian, a group of figures appeared in his line of sight.

“Seems I need to give you some color!” Luo Tian thought fiercely. He did not dodge the hand that was about to strike him but instead activated a bit of Chronological Power, flowing it into his back.

“Boom…崩…” A clear sound echoed. Then came the heavy sound of a hand striking Luo Tian’s back.

Fu Xingchen took two steps back, his palm beginning to crack. His face showed disbelief. A cold light instantly pierced into his shoulder, sending a chill through his body.

“Damn! You… are trying to assassinate me!” Fu Xingchen shouted, but then he quickly activated his cultivation to resist the cold light within his body.

“Spit…!” Luo Tian’s mouth spat out blood. His clothes on his back instantly tore apart, revealing a green palm print on his strong back, making Luo Tian’s face pale.

“Third Prince, why did you suddenly attack me? What have I done wrong? Please tell me!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed weakness. He fell to the ground, gazing at Fu Xingchen with intense disappointment and desolation.

“Third Prince, why must you do this? I am merely a subject. Although you are not the Emperor, if you want my life, just say so. I would never disobey!” Luo Tian did not wait for Fu Xingchen to respond but spoke again, his voice slightly desperate. He appeared as if the king ordered him to die, and he must comply.

“Third Prince suddenly attacked the commander!” People looked at Luo Tian, who was weak and fallen on the ground. Their eyes showed a touch of sympathy.

“It must be so. Didn’t you see? Luo Tian bowed to the Third Prince, and the Third Prince directly struck him!” People murmured. They were all subjects themselves, so they felt a bit of sympathy for Luo Tian.

Fu Xingchen had just expelled the silver needle from his body when he heard people’s murmurs. His face darkened as if it would bleed, then he looked at Luo Tian sitting on the ground. Seeing Luo Tian’s eyes filled with despair, even Fu Xingchen felt he believed what Luo Tian said.

“This commander is not simple. I only used half my strength, but with the Flying Snow Needle, it was beyond what ordinary people could withstand. He managed to reflect it back onto me!” Fu Xingchen’s eyes showed seriousness.

“Even more terrifying is that he might have already known I was going to attack him! If not, then his defense was instinctual. Either way, this commander is terrifying!” Fu Xingchen thought.

Then Fu Xingchen saw the people’s gazes looking at him. Their eyes showed disappointment, making Fu Xingchen shudder.

“Sorry, I just wanted to test your strength. My attack was a bit too strong. You are loyal, and I know that!” Fu Xingchen quickly smiled and helped Luo Tian up.

“This middle-grade sacred item pill, take it. It’s my compensation!” Fu Xingchen waved his hand and sent a middle-grade sacred item pill to Luo Tian’s hands.

“Your Highness truly wanted to test my strength. I was mistaken, your Highness. This middle-grade sacred item pill is precious. Your Highness should keep it yourself. I can’t accept it, for the sake of Star Moon Divine Clan, a little injury is nothing!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed determination. As he spoke, two more mouthfuls of blood spewed out. He swallowed the sacred item pill into his mouth, but it seemed to have no effect at all. His gaze turned again toward Fu Xingchen.

“Little brat, this middle-grade sacred item pill is not enough for you!” Luo Tian thought with disdain. His eyes looked even weaker, as if he had been severely injured.

“Damn it! You still think it’s not enough? You bastard, you really didn’t get injured!” Fu Xingchen was about to spit blood. He knew Luo Tian was fine, but he had just made people misunderstand.

“Good, you are truly the commander of Star Moon Guards. Just for this statement, I will give you this sacred herb, Star Moon Bamboo. Take it back and heal properly!” Fu Xingchen gritted his teeth and took out a small section of green bamboo, handing it to Luo Tian.

“Indeed, our Third Prince is wise and改正!” The people around sighed. Their eyes looked at Fu Xingchen with renewed respect.

Fu Xingchen’s heart was bleeding. He glared at Luo Tian with a fierce gaze, as if he would tear his face open if Luo Tian was still unwell.

“Thank you, Third Prince!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up. Without hesitation, he took the bamboo and stored it.

Then Luo Tian's body emitted a series of booming sounds. He suddenly stood up, gazing at Fu Xingchen: “Third Prince’s middle-grade sacred item pill truly has remarkable effects. My injuries have completely healed!”

“You bastard, can you act more convincingly!” Fu Xingchen looked at the lively Luo Tian and his face darkened as if it would bleed.

“Third Prince is truly generous. A sacred herb, a middle-grade sacred item pill! And it’s given to the commander of Star Moon Guards!” People immediately praised Fu Xingchen.

“Go back and heal properly!” Fu Xingchen, although deeply resentful, could not do anything. If it weren’t for the recent news that the old Emperor was about to step down, he wouldn’t have done this. But now, in such a critical moment, if his attack on the commander of Star Moon Guards became known, it would damage his reputation. So he could only swallow his anger.

“Your subordinate can still meditate!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of determination as he spoke to Fu Xingchen.

“Go on, go on. Meditate!” Fu Xingchen was so annoyed by Luo Tian’s attitude that he waved his hand, his eyes showing a hint of contempt. Fu Xingchen himself had not succeeded in meditating on it, so he didn’t believe this commander of Star Moon Guards could either.

“Originally, he wanted to meditate on the Reincarnation Heaven Art! And Third Prince actually agreed. Usually, no one could meditate on it without being driven away!” People heard Luo Tian’s words and were immediately surprised. Their eyes showed disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian, while their hearts felt pity for Fu Xingchen. Everyone knew that the commanders of the three armies were all close to their respective princes. Now, Luo Tian and Fu Xingchen seemed quite close in the eyes of outsiders.

“Hmph. Not all was wasted!” Fu Xingchen’s eyes showed a hint of smile. He began to calculate how to use this incident.

While the people around were surprised, Luo Tian also excitedly approached the gray stone tablet and sat cross-legged.

“Hum…” As soon as Luo Tian sat cross-legged, a series of humming sounds echoed within his body. Golden light transformed into golden dragons that flew out from Luo Tian’s body, then covered the gray stone tablet before disappearing.

“Showing off. Thinking that making some noise would allow you to meditate? That’s just a foolish dream!” Fu Xingchen looked at Luo Tian's performance with disdain. His contempt deepened.

Chapter 1299: The Master of Intercepting Heaven

In Star Moon Divine City’s Techniques Hall, Luo Tian sat cross-legged before the gray stone tablet. His eyes were closed, and golden light transformed into dragons that flew out from his body, then covered the gray stone tablet before disappearing.

Fu Xingchen bore a look of contempt as he watched Luo Tian sitting there. He thought Luo Tian was bluffing, for he had tried countless methods over the years but still failed to meditate on the tablet.

Fu Xingchen knew this stone tablet was no ordinary thing. When it had flown into the Techniques Hall, it had alarmed the Star Moon Divine Clan’s attendants. They confirmed that this stone tablet did not belong to the Ancient Clans and stated that the Reincarnation Heaven Art inscribed on it was extremely powerful. If one could master it, their cultivation speed would surpass others of the same age.

Over the years, Fu Xingchen was not the first to attempt to master this stone tablet. Initially, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang had also tried to meditate on it for a while, but eventually gave up and chose the Star Moon Scripture.

Luo Tian appeared calm on the outside, but his heart was filled with joy. He saw the Chronological Book in his mind constantly emitting golden symbols, which flew out from his body.

“You finally responded!” Luo Tian did not stop the symbols emitted by the Chronological Book, nor could he.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, the golden symbols seemed to have finished expelling, and the Chronological Book gradually fell silent.

“Done?” Fu Xingchen looked at Luo Tian’s fluctuating energy and sneered, waiting for him to stand up.

“Indeed, there was no hope!” Others shook their heads. They knew the commander of Star Moon Guards had failed.

“Hum…” But in an instant, Luo Tian’s body glowed again. At the same time, the massive gray stone tablet before him emitted a strong thunderous sound.

A golden light shot out from Luo Tian’s body, so fast that even Fu Xingchen did not notice it.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s soul was with the Chronological Book in a gray space. This space was illuminated by golden symbols, and if one looked closely, those golden symbols were composed of small characters.

“Is this the world within that stone tablet?” Luo Tian felt confused. He looked at the constantly flipping Chronological Book above his soul, showing a series of questions.

“Rustle… Rustle…” The golden Chronological Book kept flipping, then seemed to be pulled by something. Those golden symbols were absorbed back into the Chronological Book and finally formed small characters, engraved on the first page of the Chronological Book.

“Reincarnation Heaven Art. It is an upgraded version of the Five Elements Transformation Art!” As those symbols were engraved on the Chronological Book, Luo Tian’s mind received a series of small characters. It was indeed the true Reincarnation Heaven Art.

Luo Tian did not dare to delay, fearing that if he was too late, the Chronological Book would no longer let him see it. He could not even cry if he missed this chance.

Thinking of that, Luo Tian began to memorize the Reincarnation Heaven Art after upgrading from the Five Elements Transformation Art.

While Luo Tian was constantly memorizing, his physical body outside the stone tablet began to emit waves. It seemed like a gluttonous beast, instantly sucking out all the energy in the Techniques Hall and then spreading outward.

“Hum…” A series of humming sounds echoed through the sky of the Techniques Hall. The massive energy vortex grew larger and gradually spread across Star Moon Divine City.

“Rustle… Rustle…” The next moment, the roof of the Techniques Hall collapsed with a crash. A terrifying energy vortex instantly descended upon Luo Tian’s physical body, pouring into it.

“Damn! Did he succeed?” Fu Xingchen's face changed. His eyes showed a sinister look, and a wild wave instantly swept over Fu Xingchen and the onlookers. The terrifying gust pushed Fu Xingchen far away.

The entire Star Moon Divine City trembled, sensing a terrifying fluctuation above their heads.

The terrifying vortex continued to spread. Soon it reached the entire Star Moon Continent, and for a moment, all creatures on the Star Moon Continent felt their energy vanish.

“Drip… Drip…” The densest energy transformed into an energy cloud covering the entire Star Moon Divine City. Droplets of energy rained down, dripping onto the city's buildings.

The entire Star Moon Divine City’s plants began to grow wildly, turning the whole city into a green expanse.

“Energy Rain!” The people of Star Moon Divine City showed excitement. They had never encountered such an unusual phenomenon.

“Who is it? Is it the city’s attendant?” The entire Star Moon Divine City was in shock. Although they were shocked, they all started to cultivate and refine the energy within each droplet.

“Has the Reincarnation Heaven Art been mastered?” In Star Moon Divine City’s Attendant Hall, three figures changed expressions. These three were the city's three attendants, top-tier powerhouses of the Chronological Era.

Their eyes turned toward the Techniques Hall. They showed a hint of shock. They had long realized the Reincarnation Heaven Art's power but hadn’t expected it to be so霸道.

The entire Star Moon Divine City and even the whole Star Moon Continent trembled. Strong individuals flew up, heading toward the source of the energy vortex—the Techniques Hall.

“He is!” Fu Xingxuan instantly appeared at the perimeter of the Techniques Hall, her face showing disbelief.

At this moment, no one could stand within ten miles of Luo Tian. Anyone trying to approach would be pushed back by the terrifying energy fluctuations.

“Haha! Indeed, my commander!” Fu Xingyue laughed loudly and appeared beside Fu Xingxuan. His heart was excited.

At first, Fu Xingyue had thought it was Fu Xingchen who had succeeded. This made him extremely nervous, as Fu Xingchen’s desire to master the Reincarnation Heaven Art was well-known throughout the city. But upon arriving here, he saw Luo Tian sitting there and his heart, which had sunk to the bottom, suddenly rose.

“Is he the commander of Star Moon Guards?” A young man with a deep gaze appeared among the crowd, followed by a tall and strong warrior—Kou Tiande, the commander of Star Yang Army.

“Yes. His original name was Xiao Mengchen, but he was given the surname Fu by my second brother!” Kou Tiande bowed and spoke. His eyes showed a hint of admiration.

The person who could make Kou Tiande so respectful was none other than the Emperor of Star Moon Divine City or the first prince, Fu Xingyang.

“Talented person. Unfortunately, he cannot be used by me!” Fu Xingyang’s eyes were deep and mysterious. He turned his fingers on a ring, speaking softly. No one could guess what Fu Xingyang was thinking.

Luo Tian at this moment did not know that he had caused a strong tremor again, even more shocking than the previous time when he forged a middle-grade sacred item pill. It had even spread across the entire Star Moon Continent.

Luo Tian forgot time, his soul solidly seated in the gray space. He did not know how long it had been until the golden symbols finally disappeared, all absorbed by the Chronological Book.

At the same time, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. His gaze showed a hint of joy as he muttered: “Reincarnation Immortal Body?”

As all the golden symbols disappeared, the Chronological Book fell silent. The golden light was no longer so intense, shining on Luo Tian’s face.

Luo Tian also fully understood the secret of the Reincarnation Heaven Art. The power of this technique was even stronger than the Five Elements Transformation Art. In fact, the Five Elements Transformation Art and Reincarnation Heaven Art were one and the same. The Five Elements Transformation Art was the upper half, while the Reincarnation Heaven Art was the lower half.

The lower half of the Reincarnation Heaven Art required the cultivation of a Soulless Immortal Body. Each time one cultivated a Soulless Immortal Body, the cultivator's strength would instantly multiply.

This Soulless Immortal Body also had an extremely powerful function. It was like another life for the cultivator, allowing them to sacrifice one Soulless Immortal Body to replace the death of the person who cultivated this art.

“Powerful technique. I was right not to abandon the Five Elements Transformation Art!” Luo Tian muttered.

“Who left this Reincarnation Heaven Art? It has such an extremely powerful ability. How could it transfer the technique to this place?” Luo Tian felt a series of questions in his heart.

His soul looked around the space, trying to find some clues. Soon, he noticed that there were characters left on the gray stone walls.

“I am Lord Mo Shang. I leave this Reincarnation Heaven Art and the Intercepting Heaven Pill Formula for those with fate. If you can master the Reincarnation Heaven Art, then your talent must be extraordinary. Perhaps in the future you will experience the Three Fates of Heaven and Humanity. I also experienced the Three Fates of Heaven and Humanity, so I created this Intercepting Heaven Pill!”

“But this Intercepting Heaven Pill can only resist the first two fates. As for the third fate, the Fate of Heaven, it requires your own fortune!”

“I made a mistake in the past. I sealed the Ancient Clans within the Origin Domain, so I left this tablet among the royal family. I hope that those who master the Reincarnation Heaven Art will promote peace between the clans and humans. Fulfill my last wish!”

“I also left a legacy in the place where I passed through the Fate of Heaven. If you are fated, you can also go find it.” After reading the dense characters, Luo Tian’s face showed excitement.

“Mo Shang! The Master of Intercepting Heaven!” Luo Tian's mind trembled, recalling who Mo Shang was.

“Intercepting Heaven Pill. The legacy of the Master of Intercepting Heaven!” Luo Tian's heart was excited. The Three Fates of Heaven and Humanity had always been a thorn in his side. Now, he found the solution in Star Moon Divine City.

“A great fortune! The legacy of the Master of Intercepting Heaven. I must obtain it!” Luo Tian knew he had received a great fortune. What was the Master of Intercepting Heaven? He was one who subdued the Ancient Clans and divided the Star Domain into ten domains. The legacy of the Master of Intercepting Heaven must be extremely powerful.

Chapter 1300: So Fast?

Luo Tian's solid soul stood in the gray stone tablet space, his face filled with excitement. He firmly memorized the Intercepting Heaven Pill formula.

After Luo Tian had memorized it, the golden Chronological Book took his soul away from the stone tablet space.

Outside, the energy rain continued but had become smaller than before, no longer like a downpour.

“Boom! I’ve broken through!” A series of loud laughter echoed throughout Star Moon Divine City. A group of powerful figures ascended into the sky, their gazes turning toward the Techniques Hall with gratitude.

This energy rain was of great benefit to everyone in Star Moon Divine City, raising the city's overall strength by two-tenths. On this day, countless people broke through.

Even Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang, the prodigies, gained much benefit from this energy rain. Their cultivation power also increased significantly.

A group of people stood outside the Techniques Hall, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian, who sat there like a golden stone tablet.

They knew the biggest beneficiary of this phenomenon was Luo Tian, as he was at the center of the storm. Most of the energy had been absorbed by him like a glutton.

“Hum…” Golden light flashed, and Luo Tian’s soul instantly returned to his physical body. Upon returning to his body, he immediately felt the difference in his physical form.

“I’ve become stronger!” Luo Tian’s heart was happy. He then suddenly realized that his dantian no longer resembled an ocean but had transformed into a figure sitting there. The figure’s appearance was exactly Luo Tian's.

“Soulless Immortal Body!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. His eyes showed disbelief. He hadn’t expected that merely by activating the Reincarnation Heaven Art, he had cultivated a Soulless Immortal Body.

Luo Tian could feel that although the Chronological Ocean in his dantian was gone, this Soulless Immortal Body contained even more terrifying power than the Chronological Ocean.

“Cultivating three Soulless Immortal Bodies means reaching the middle of the Chronological Era. Cultivating six means reaching the end of the Chronological Era. Cultivating nine means reaching the peak of the Chronological Era! I have cultivated one Soulless Immortal Body, but in reality, my combat power is already invincible at the beginning of the Chronological Era. Even if an opponent was in the middle of the Chronological Era and had no special means, I would dare to fight!” Luo Tian thought to himself. Then he slowly opened his eyes.

“Hmm?” As Luo Tian opened his eyes, he saw a group of eyes staring at him with envy.

“I didn’t want to be showy. Yet I’ve attracted so many people!” Luo Tian felt a bit helpless, looking at the crowd with a sigh.
