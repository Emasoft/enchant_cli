“This kid hasn’t entered True Immortality yet; he must have some intentions. I heard the city lord gave him an Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul. He’s clearly trying to enter Ultimate Dao True Immortality. Let him take it as a bet!” Xue Mian said to his robust younger brother.

“Interesting. Let me see how I’ll deal with this kid!” The sturdy youth shouted, his face mask revealing a sinister expression.

“Face-masked Lei Ming, if you’ve got guts, come out and fight! Today, I Tian will definitely make you run away in disgrace!” Ye Liangchen shouted, his voice brimming with arrogance.

“Kid, have you gathered enough battle merits?” Before Ye Liangchen’s words had even faded, a thunderous voice echoed from the sky, causing people to gasp in shock and Ye Liangchen to shrink back.

“Lei Ming has arrived!” The crowd parted as a sturdy figure stepped forward toward Luo Tian, his green mask and towering frame radiating an overwhelming aura.

“Ten million battle merits!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a dazzling light flashed from his wrist. Ten million battle merits flew from Luo Tian’s grasp into Lei Ming’s hand.

“How does he have so many battle merits? Didn’t they say he stopped selling ghost-repelling pills!” The crowd’s curiosity was piqued as Luo Tian produced another ten million battle merits.

“Fair. Considering you challenged me with a half-True Immortal, I won’t take advantage of you!”

“If you defeat me, this will be yours. If you lose, I’ll take your ten million battle merits!” Lei Ming waved his hand, and five-colored lightning formed in his palm. Within the lightning, a gray aura hovered—its power so immense it made Luo Tian’s brows furrow.

“True Immortal Soul! A complete Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul!” The crowd gasped in unison, their faces filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian’s breath quickened. He hadn’t expected to encounter a second Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul in just two months.

“If I can obtain this, and find another, I might reach the Ultimate Stage!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination, his thoughts rekindling.

“Kid, getting this soul won’t be easy. You’ll have to beat me!” Lei Ming said, tucking the soul away.

“Begin!” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze fixed on Lei Ming. Yet for some reason, he felt no hatred toward him.

Due to Xue Mian’s influence, Luo Tian also disliked Lei Ming. But Lei Ming’s refusal to take advantage of him had shifted Luo Tian’s perception.

“This…” Seeing Luo Tian’s somewhat kind gaze, Lei Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He realized he had overacted—why would anyone casually give an Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul to someone?

“Thunderous…!” As he recalled his senior’s plan, Lei Ming let out a quiet laugh. He kicked off the ground, transforming into a streak of lightning that shot toward Luo Tian.

“Kid, still daydreaming? Think you can beat me?” A cold, dismissive voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making his face shift.

Chapter 2040: Earth Store King's Palace

“Does he know me?” Luo Tian quickly deduced a possibility, his gaze scrutinizing Lei Ming.

“Who could pierce my Royal Battle Technique without harm yet offer an Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul as a bet?” Luo Tian now suspected Lei Ming was someone he knew.

“Die!” As Luo Tian pondered, a cold voice echoed in his ear. A shadow materialized behind him, a black dagger like a venomous snake slicing toward Luo Tian’s throat.

“Crash…” At the same time, Luo Tian reversed his body and clapped his hands together. The black dagger was caught between his palms, a cold aura instantly spreading through Luo Tian’s body.

“Night!” The crowd gasped upon seeing the attacker. They hadn’t expected Lei Ming’s younger brother to strike Luo Tian.

Cold eyes peered through the black mask, reflecting in Luo Tian’s gaze. A familiar sensation coursed through Luo Tian’s heart.

The black dagger twisted, and the shadow retreated. A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ear: “Return the Ultimate Dao True Immortal Soul to him. That thing isn’t yours to possess!”

“Once something is in my grasp, few manage to take it back!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. The familiar sensation lasted only a moment before being replaced by coldness.

“Brave! But fear you have the life to take it, but not the strength to use it!” The cold voice echoed beneath the black mask. A clear killing intent was unhidden. Yet Night didn’t strike, instead turning and walking toward his residence.

Lei Ming’s face bore anger, a fake arrogance. He glared at Luo Tian before following Night.

“Who are they?” Luo Tian watched them leave, his brows furrowed. Their presence felt oddly strange.

“In the courtyard,” Lei Ming and the cloaked Night stood facing each other.

“You performed too poorly; I nearly couldn’t bear it!” A cold voice made Lei Ming’s eyes flicker with embarrassment.

“Master’s performance is unmatched!”

“And you, expressionless face—nothing needed…” Lei Ming shouted, admiration in his eyes.

……

“Tian, you’ve become a Thousand-Commander?” Ye Liangchen stared at Luo Tian, his eyes alight with joy.

A Thousand-Commander held an unparalleled status in the military. A single command could send a common soldier to die unconditionally.

“Luo Dan Shi, truly a genius! So swiftly achieving the rank of Thousand-Commander!”

“Hail to the Thousand-Commander!” A chorus of greetings and respectful voices echoed, people gazing at Luo Tian with reverence.

“Let’s go. See our new residence!” Luo Tian chuckled, rising and entering Lei Ming’s former courtyard.

A Thousand-Commander’s residence surpassed a Hundred-Commander’s by leaps and bounds. Its size was ten times greater, with arrays to repel ghostly energy and rich spiritual qi. The items within were exquisite—had it not been for the military setting, one might have mistaken it for a sect’s abode.

A hundred people entered smoothly. The entire courtyard could easily accommodate them, even Huo Zhen’s eyes gleamed with excitement.

Huo Zhen had previously been a Hundred-Commander but never aligned with a Thousand-Commander. Thus, he rarely entered their courtyard.

Now, Huo Zhen had reached the middle stage of True Immortality, surpassing Luo Tian in strength. Yet he remained, knowing without Luo Tian, he might still be at the early stage of True Immortality.

The military’s people were fiercely loyal. They repaid kindness and avenged grudges. Luo Tian had treated Huo Zhen well, so he wouldn’t leave easily.

Luo Tian also hadn’t mistreated him, even gifting Huo Zhen an upper-tier spiritual weapon. This made Huo Zhen more devoted.

In the following period, Huo Zhen, Ye Liangchen, and Zhang Desheng continuously recruited people. Luo Tian’s forces grew to hundreds. Many of the original hundred became squad leaders and Hundred-Commanders, expanding Luo Tian’s influence in the Eighth Army.

During this month, Luo Tian led his forces out of Buxian City to hunt ghosts constantly. This helped the hundreds integrate quickly, and Luo Tian soon earned some authority.

By day, Qin He Feng and Ye Chen were spurred by Luo Tian’s success to accumulate battle merits desperately, aiming to become the next Thousand-Commander and not fall too far behind.

Time passed slowly. With only three days left until Luo Tian’s mission to infiltrate Hell and find the Mother of the Nirvana Flower, a message reached Ye Liangchen’s ears.

In a vast battlefield, a piece of land collapsed, revealing a massive palace. Ghosts roamed within, terrifying. All cultivators in that area were sucked into the palace.

Ye Chen’s group was nearby and was swept up. Only Qiu Qian Di escaped via special means, returning to Buxian City.

“Chen Ge!” Ye Liangchen furrowed his brows. Though he rarely interacted with Ye Chen, their friendship remained—since childhood, Ye Liangchen had regarded Ye Chen as his elder brother.

During this time, Ye Chen always shared battle merits with Ye Liangchen. Yet Ye Liangchen refused them—partly because Luo Tian was present, making him indifferent to Ye Chen’s merits; partly because Ye Chen had his own group. If he accepted all the merits, it would cause resentment among his subordinates.

As soon as the palace appeared, Buxian City’s Lord Jiang Chen personally left to investigate. Upon seeing the towering stone tablet outside, he returned immediately.

“Earth Store King’s Palace!” Jiang Chen said only four words upon returning, causing several army commanders to gasp in shock.

The Earth Store King was a superpower in Hell, dominating an area. In Hell, the hierarchy was clear—ten Yama Kings governed it, akin to the nine immortal mountains of the heavens. Below them were eight Heavenly Kings, second only to the Yama Kings. The Earth Store King was one of them.

The eight Heavenly Kings operated under a hereditary system. When a king aged, their offspring would inherit the role. However, this Earth Store King had no descendants, remaining solitary. Thus, there was no heir.

Such a Heavenly King’s palace would be coveted by anyone. Buxian City aimed for it, and Hell was even more desperate—capturing it would be a chance to ascend.

The entire Buxian City buzzed with discussions about the Earth Store King’s Palace. Long-term residents knew Hell’s Heavenly Kings’ value.

“Tian, I’m going!” In the courtyard, Ye Liangchen rushed to Luo Tian, his voice resolute.

Normally, Ye Liangchen would never leave Buxian City. But since it was Ye Chen caught in the palace, he had no choice. If Luo Tian were captured, Ye Liangchen would also go.

“Liangchen, stay calm. It’s not like other places!” Luo Tian frowned, responding. Ye Liangchen had lost his mind, but Luo Tian remained clear-headed.

The Earth Store King’s Palace wasn’t just dangerous; it was haunted by Hell’s strongholds. It would surely draw the attention of Immortal Kings, making their presence likely as cannon fodder.

Moreover, Buxian City’s people seemed unified, but Luo Tian was different. He carried the Ghost Valley Seal; many wanted his life. The Earth Store King’s Palace was an ideal spot for attacks.

Also, Ye Liangchen had a history of arrogance, having offended many. He was also a direct heir of Star River Sect, the next sect leader—others might scheme against him.

In short, if they both entered the Earth Store King’s Palace, especially Luo Tian, he would be everyone’s enemy.

“Liangchen, you stay. I’ll go!” Luo Tian thought for a moment before telling Ye Liangchen. He needed to enter Hell anyway, and this was the perfect chance.

“Tian, I’m going with you!” Ye Liangchen shook his head. His eyes were resolute now, no longer showing arrogance. He was the prodigy Ye Liangchen, one of Star River Sect’s three disciples and next sect leader.

“Good!” Luo Tian saw Ye Liangchen’s determination. Though Ye Liangchen feared death, he still had limits.

Luo Tian choosing to let Ye Liangchen stay meant shifting all attention onto himself. How could Ye Liangchen not understand?

“Isn’t it just the Earth Store King’s Palace? Whether it’s human or ghost, they’ll all die!” Ye Liangchen, upon Luo Tian’s agreement, regained his arrogant demeanor.

“Eighth Army, assemble!” As the two finalized their plan, Ke Duanshan’s voice echoed through the courtyard.

“Let’s go. The army commander and city lords probably have decisions!” Luo Tian stepped forward toward the outer courtyard.

Figures moved swiftly, standing in formation. They gazed at Ke Duanshan who stood there.

“Let’s go. All Thousand-Commanders and above follow me to the Earth Store King’s Palace!” Ke Duanshan didn’t waste words, his voice causing everyone’s faces to shift.

“Are we all going to the Earth Store King’s Palace?” Everyone felt excitement, but no one spoke. The Eighth Army’s quality was evident.

Ke Duanshan wore a satisfied expression, then took flight toward Buxian City’s gate.

Chapter 2041: Entering the Palace

“Thousand-Commander… That means I can’t go?” Ye Liangchen’s face bore resentment, but he had no choice. Ke Duanshan had already issued the order, likely by Buxian City Lord Jiang Chen.

“Stay put. I’ll bring Ye Chen back!” Luo Tian told Ye Liangchen, then took flight after Ke Duanshan.

“Ten… a hundred… a thousand…” Over ten thousand people soared into the sky. These were all the Eighth Army’s Thousand-Commanders, with the weakest at the early stage of True Immortality and the strongest at the late stage.

Luo Tian stood among them, standing out remarkably. He was a half-True Immortal leading a Thousand-Commander—never before had such a case.

Qin He Feng and Ye Chen were also among the crowd. They had recently entered the early stage of True Immortality, accumulating merits to become Thousand-Commanders.

Ten thousand people glanced at each other, following Ke Duanshan toward Buxian City’s gate.

Meanwhile, others from different armies also took flight—several army commanders and their Thousand-Commanders.

The commanders exchanged glances, nodding. This time, they were competitors. In the Earth Store King’s Palace, they first needed to unite against Hell’s forces before vying for their own gains.

“My goal is to rescue Ye Chen. I won’t think about anything else!” Luo Tian gazed at the other armies, a hint of admiration in his eyes.

Combined, the several armies totaled nearly thirty thousand True Immortals. This formidable force could sweep aside any sect without an Immortal King. Buxian City’s power was evident.

Luo Tian knew his strength. If he competed with them, he’d definitely lose. Jiang Chen and Wu Mian might also secretly go—competing would be like seeking death.

Opportunities required strength. Without it, rushing in meant losing one’s life.

Thirty thousand people gathered without releasing energy, yet their presence was like a sky itself, suffocating.

The city gate opened. Eight army commanders led the way, followed by seventy-two Ten-Thousand Commanders. Under Buxian City’s respectful gaze, they exited the city.

Heaven and earth changed color. Wherever they went, ghosts retreated. Even Buxian City’s thick ghostly qi was dispersed.

But Hell’s battlefield was vast. Once out of Buxian City, the thirty thousand seemed tiny.

The thirty thousand surged eastward. Along the way, some ghosts hadn’t even time to roar before being slain by Ke Duanshan and others.

After seven days of travel, they reached the designated location—a massive pit appeared in their view.

A black stone tablet stood between heaven and earth, its powerful characters etched into it. Luo Tian felt the immense aura within those characters, as if a supreme immortal stood there.

Behind the tablet, black mist swirled. A powerful pressure filled heaven and earth. Below the mist were countless palaces, each radiating a chilling ghostly qi—exactly one hundred and eight.

At the base of the towering tablet stood a figure, Wu Mian, cloaked in black mist.

“Have you come? Buxian City also wants to claim our Hell’s Heavenly King!” Wu Mian’s cold voice echoed. His faceless visage left people to judge his disdain by sound alone.

“Roar…” A thunderous roar echoed, as if sensing Wu Mian’s presence. A series of black humanoid figures stood behind him, their power no less than Buxian City’s.

Due to proximity to the Hell Gate, these ghosts’ power was astonishing, subtly overpowering Buxian City’s side.

“Wu Mian himself is here!” Upon seeing Wu Mian, Ke Duanshan and the other commanders paused slightly.

“Damn it. I don’t want to see anyone, but I have to!” Luo Tian’s heart jolted upon seeing Wu Mian.

“Go…!” Wu Mian waved his sleeve, a fierce wind roaring out. The wind swept toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Block it!” The eight army commanders shouted, their half-Immortal King strength erupting. Invisible waves burst from them, countering Wu Mian’s Immortal King pressure.

In an instant, the eight commanders retreated a step. The collision echoed through heaven and earth, with the sky cracking and black mist swirling.

Wu Mian didn’t strike again. He ignored Ke Duanshan’s group, turning instead to the vast palace.

Ke Duanshan’s group didn’t rashly attack. Though they had blocked Wu Mian’s casual strike, he was an early Immortal King.

Both sides seemed wary of each other, avoiding conflict. A battle would mean a life-or-death fight since both sides had elite forces.

“Many of the Hell’s Death List have arrived!” Behind Wu Mian stood a series of black figures, their ghostly qi澎湃. Their eyes gleamed with greed as they gazed at Ke Duanshan’s group.

“That’s Xue Mian from the Death List. He escaped from us, a disgrace for our sect!”

“That’s Zhang Kongcheng? He once killed our king!” The ghosts behind Wu Mian eyed Ke Duanshan’s group like prey.

“That’s Luo Tian, who recently entered the Death List. I heard he also joined the main force to fight us!”

“He’s a half-True Immortal, yet hasn’t entered True Immortality!”

“Among the Death List, Luo Tian is the weakest!” Almost instantly, Hell’s side noticed Luo Tian’s presence. Their eyes gleamed with greed.

“Killing someone on the Death List grants a rich reward and a title of Ten-Thousand-Commander!” Hell’s side erupted in excitement. Though Ke Duanshan and Xue Mian were strong, killing them was too difficult.

But Luo Tian, a half-True Immortal, offered an opportunity. Though he wielded the Ghost Control Seal, their suppression was minimal—especially with Wu Mian, an Immortal King ghost, nearby.

“Did that kid come too?” Wu Mian also took interest in Luo Tian standing among Buxian City’s group.

“Damn it, did I offend your family?” Luo Tian jolted. He hadn’t expected a mere half-True Immortal to draw so much attention, with nearly all Hell’s early True Immortals eyeing him.

When Luo Tian looked at Wu Mian, he saw his faceless, pale complexion. He instinctively shivered.

“Thunderous…!” As Luo Tian trembled, a series of thunderous sounds echoed. The massive palace began to roar, and the black mist covering it seemed stirred by something, forming a door in their view.

“It’s opened!” Almost instantly, people deduced the situation, their eyes alight with excitement.

“Follow me in!” Wu Mian shouted. Since some had already been sucked in, he was worried about others taking the prize.

“Rumbling…!” Ghosts roared. A host of ghostly figures surged toward the Earth Store King’s Palace.

“Buzz…” Actually, no need for the ghosts to move. A powerful suction emerged from the door.

The suction grew stronger, initially twisting space. Half-True Immortals couldn’t withstand it and were sucked into the palace.

“Early True Immortality… Middle True Immortality…” As time passed, even late-stage True Immortals couldn’t resist and were pulled into the palace. Luo Tian was among them.

Buxian City and Hell’s forces, nearly tens of thousands, were all devoured. Only Wu Mian and several half-Immortal King subordinates remained.

Buxian City was left with the eight army commanders. They felt no suction and even sensed a strong repulsion.

“Only True Immortals are allowed in?” Wu Mian’s voice carried anger as he gazed at the black mist-covered palace.

“I, Wu Mian, a Hell’s Eight Ghost Generals. You let humans in but not me? What right do you have to deny my inheritance!” Wu Mian roared, then took flight toward the now-closed door.

An Immortal King’s wrath caused a sea of corpses. The thunderous sound echoed, and Wu Mian transformed into a black cloud. The entire world seemed to tremble before him.

“Using Heaven’s power—this is an Immortal King!” Ke Duanshan and the others wore solemn expressions, gathering together. They each held a golden great sword.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Next moment, the black cloud collided with the black door. The entire palace trembled violently.

A crackling sound echoed, but it wasn’t the Earth Store King’s barrier. Instead, Wu Mian’s body flew back, blood staining his pale face.

Ke Duanshan and the others were stunned. They gazed at Wu Mian flying back, eight of them gathering together. The golden great sword glowed brilliantly, their eyes cautious as they watched Wu Mian.

“Damn it… Damn it!” Wu Mian roared repeatedly. The world trembled with his fury, but eventually calmed. He gazed at Ke Duanshan’s eight.

“If so, let’s kill a few Buxian City army commanders to relieve our anger. It would be a delightful act!” Wu Mian sneered, his nine half-Immortal King ghost subordinates radiating chilling qi. Their eyes gleamed as they stared at Ke Duanshan’s eight.

Chapter 2042: Killing in the Burial Palace

A sense of irresistible force enveloped Luo Tian’s entire body, as if an invisible hand gripped him, forcibly pulling him into the dark burial palace.

Darkness invaded Luo Tian. After an unknown duration, a cold sensation spread through his body. He felt his feet touch the ground.

“Where is this?” Luo Tian surveyed around, finding the space vast and endless. The surroundings were dark, with swirling ghostly qi.

“Luo Tian!” As Luo Tian surveyed the area, several figures stood tens of feet away. Their eyes gleamed with joy.

“Luck is good—entering this Earth Store King’s Palace, I found him!” The figures didn’t hesitate. They took flight toward Luo Tian.

They were from Hell, their strength all early True Immortals. Originally, they hadn’t intended to vie for the Earth Store King’s inheritance.

But they had set their sights on Luo Tian. Compared to vying for the Earth Store King’s inheritance, they believed killing Luo Tian or someone on the Death List was more secure and practical.

Almost instantly, five black lights flickered. Five youths formed seals with their hands, a black flying sword slicing toward Luo Tian. The sword radiated the aura of a middle-tier spiritual weapon.

Yet, this black sword wasn’t a spiritual weapon. It was entirely imbued with ghostly qi—equivalent to a middle-tier spiritual weapon in power.

Another four early True Immortals also activated their treasures. Each was a middle-tier ghost weapon, radiating tremendous waves toward Luo Tian.

These five aimed to kill Luo Tian swiftly, fearing any mishaps.

Five treasures, their power overwhelming. Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He wasn’t afraid of these five Hell people, but he feared the commotion would draw others, possibly benefiting them.

“Quickly end it!” Luo Tian had the same thought. He waved his hands, and the Ghost Control Seal flew from above his head. An invisible wave swept toward the five dark figures.

“Buzz…” The wave, which had a special effect against ghosts, filled the five’s surroundings.

Faced with this power that controlled ghosts, the five’s faces bore sneers. They still manipulated their treasures toward Luo Tian.

“Something’s wrong!” Seeing the five’s mocking smiles, Luo Tian felt a chill. He had no time to think—his hands formed a barrier while he grabbed the Cracking Spear, which appeared in his hand. He swung it.

The sound of clashing metal echoed through the empty space, and five treasures were repelled by Luo Tian.

“Strong!” Seeing their treasures repelled, the five’s faces changed slightly. Though they were early True Immortals, none had confidence to fight five at once and repel all their middle-tier ghost weapons.

Though they were repelled, the five still controlled their treasures toward Luo Tian.

“Countless evil ghosts, obey my command!” Luo Tian roared, activating the Ghost Control Seal to control them. If he controlled a few of them, their attacks would naturally be neutralized.

“Idiot!” One youth spoke, gazing at Luo Tian as the wave surrounded him. He even inhaled two breaths.

“Useless?” Seeing the youth’s actions, Luo Tian’s face slightly changed. He understood why these five had been so confident and even used the Ghost Control Seal, which was highly effective against ghosts. Yet they still had that expression.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian was distracted, a hammer struck his shoulder. His body swayed slightly.

As he fell, Luo Tian swung the spear horizontally, colliding with a flying sword aimed at his throat. A crescent blade was also repelled.

“Boom… Boom…” The sound of heavy collisions echoed. Three middle-tier spiritual weapons struck Luo Tian, causing him to spit blood.

“Kid, do you think having the Ghost Control Seal makes you invincible here?” One youth sneered. His body radiated black qi, and he activated his treasure toward Luo Tian.

“If it’s useless, then I’ll have to trouble you!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He now understood why the Ghost Control Seal was ineffective against these people.

“These aren’t ghosts, just long-term practitioners of ghostly qi!” Luo Tian thought to himself. He then took flight, the Cracking Spear radiating intense divine light toward the five.

“Buzz…” The Ghost Control Seal also descended, pressing down with immense pressure on the youths.

The collision sound returned. This time, Luo Tian was prepared. Five middle-tier ghost weapons were repelled instantly.

“Come here!” The five shouted, attempting to retrieve their treasures.

“You talk too much!” The youth who had mocked Luo Tian reached for his flying sword. But before he could grasp it, a cold voice echoed in his ear. A streak of light fell.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed. A golden spear struck the youth’s arm, instantly severing it. The youth screamed in agony.

“Do you want him?” Luo Tian grabbed the sword and tossed it. A flash of light, blood splattered. The cold sword pierced the youth’s throat. His face still bore intense disbelief.

From repelling their treasures to killing the youth, it seemed slow but was actually instantaneous. Others hadn’t reacted in time—just as they grabbed their treasures, they saw the youth’s death.

“How strong!” The remaining four youths gazed with disbelief. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so ruthless. Though not as strong as Xue Mian, he had killed an early True Immortal with a half-True Immortal—clearly showing his strength.

“Flee…” The four didn’t linger. They knew the dead youth’s strength was similar to theirs. Luo Tian had killed him instantly, so he could kill them too.

“If you fight to the end, there might be one or two who escape. But…” Luo Tian smiled lightly. He took out the Shooting Sun Bow,凝聚 three spiritual arrows. He drew the bow and released it instantly. Three streaks of light flew toward three ghosts.

After shooting three arrows, Luo Tian took flight, surpassing early True Immortals. He chased after another.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Three blood mists scattered in the dark space. At the same time, Luo Tian’s figure caught up with the fleeing youth.

“Damn it!” The youth’s eyes flashed madness. He spat blood, and a black ghost pearl shattered, forming thick ghostly qi around him.

As the youth completed this, Luo Tian’s figure appeared behind him. The golden Cracking Spear sliced through darkness. Two times the physical strength, plus spiritual qi enhancement—its power was terrifying.

“Crack…” The barrier formed by the self-destructing middle-tier ghost weapon, like a fragile paper, was shattered by Luo Tian’s spear. The Cracking Spear didn’t stop but struck the youth’s body.

“Spit…” The youth spat blood, but used that impact to fly away a distance.

“Die!” Luo Tian waved his hand. The Cracking Spear became a streak of light, flying toward the youth.

“Ah…” The youth roared. His mouth spat black blood. Blood凝聚 into a fierce ghost face. At the same time, his body seemed drained, turning into skin and bones but still alive, fleeing quickly.

“Roar…” The ghost face appeared instantly. It opened its mouth to suck in, changing the Cracking Spear’s trajectory.

The ghost face shattered. The Cracking Spear returned to Luo Tian’s hand. Yet, Luo Tian’s expression was somewhat grim.

“He escaped…” Luo Tian murmured lowly. From the start, he knew this youth was strongest. He chose to personally chase him. The other three were eliminated with the Shooting Sun Bow.

But Luo Tian hadn’t expected this situation to let the youth escape. Perhaps it was due to his own carelessness, but he couldn’t deny this youth’s strength—among early True Immortals, it was formidable.

Luo Tian didn’t chase him. He directly took out the Thousand-Phantom Mask, putting it on. His appearance changed into a middle-aged man. He knew his face was a target. If he showed up as Luo Tian, he’d be in trouble. Even with great strength, too many people would overwhelm him. Especially with True Immortal late-stage and even peak-level masters.

After changing his appearance, Luo Tian felt safer. He gazed around the space. It had no life, only thick ghostly qi.

Under a black mountain stood a gaunt youth. His eyes showed relief. This was the youth who had escaped from Luo Tian.

“That Luo Tian is so strong!” The youth panted, fleeing for an hour. He felt no pursuit behind him and rested here after exhausting himself.

Fortunately, this space had thick ghostly qi—thicker than outside. For ghost cultivators, it was beneficial for recovery.

The youth recovered some strength. He took out a black token and glared with a cold smile, imprinting it.

“I don’t believe we can’t kill you. Fifty, five hundred, five thousand—can’t we?” The youth cursed.

Chapter 2043: One Hundred and Eight Palaces
