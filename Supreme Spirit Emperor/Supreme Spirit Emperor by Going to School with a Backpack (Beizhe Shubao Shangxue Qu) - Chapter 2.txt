Luo Tian gazed at the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills in Gu Yun's hand, and Gu Lei suddenly felt a surge of委屈. A few days ago, he had desperately begged his father for one of these pills but failed to obtain even a single one. Now, Gu Yun had voluntarily given the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills to Luo Tian, which filled Gu Lei with jealousy.

"Father! Why give it to him!" Gu Lei's face turned red as he stared at Gu Yun with a bitter expression.

"Rude! What I do is none of your concern. Get out!" Seeing his son dare to question him, Gu Yun's temper flared.

Realizing his father was truly angry, Gu Lei dared not provoke him further and left the hall with lowered eyes. Yet before exiting, he cast a jealous glance at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, having spent time in the Feiyun Sect, knew the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills were precious. He was unsure how to respond. The pills' immense appeal for his cultivation growth conflicted with his unease at accepting such a valuable gift.

"Don't overthink it," Gu Yun smiled, sensing Luo Tian's hesitation and signaling him not to worry.

Understanding Gu Yun's words, Luo Tian no longer hesitated. He placed the jade bottle in his sleeve, vowing secretly to repay Gu Yun's kindness when opportunity arose.

After Luo Tian and the others left, only Gu Yun and Gu Qianxue remained in the hall.

Gu Qianxue secretly glanced at Gu Yun, then asked cautiously: "Father, who is he? Could he truly be your illegitimate son as the rumors suggest? Mother has been... "

"Spit!..." Gu Yun abruptly spat out his tea, interrupting her. He gritted his teeth: "Li Yuande, if I meet you again, I'll break your mouth!"

After cursing, Gu Yun explained to his beloved daughter, eventually convincing her that Luo Tian was not his son.

As Gu Qianxue left with a hint of interest, Gu Yun chuckled: "I actually hope he were my son!"

Gu Qianxue had barely stepped out of the hall when she overheard her father's words and nearly stumbled.

Luo Tian arrived at his assigned residence with Tiantai, a small courtyard filled with lush bamboo and serene surroundings. The arrangement revealed Gu Yun's high regard for Luo Tian, deepening his curiosity about why Gu Yun treated him so kindly.

When Luo Tian entered the courtyard, he found a plump figure standing at the door.

"Gu Lei!" Luo Tian immediately thought of Gu Yun's son from the hall, a brash young man.

Luo Tian didn't know what scheme Gu Lei had in mind, but recalling the young man's gaze when he left earlier, he knew it would be no good.

"Hey! Dare to bet with me? If I win, you hand over the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills!" Gu Lei directly stated his intention.

"Sorry, not interested," Luo Tian replied politely, though irritation stirred within him. Considering Gu Lei was Gu Yun's son, he gave him face.

"You! A coward! I don't know why my father took you in as chief guest, but do you even want to hear my bet?" Gu Lei sneered.

"Alright, what's the wager? What's your stake?" Luo Tian finally snapped, unwilling to let Gu Lei provoke him further. Though he was Gu Yun's son, it didn't mean he'd tolerate being stepped on.

"A Yellow-Rank Martial Art!" Gu Lei confidently said, believing Luo Tian would be tempted. After all, martial arts were rare treasures, and Luo Tian's attire suggested he had no access to such things.

Initially indifferent to the bet, Luo Tian's expression hardened upon hearing Gu Lei's words. Having spent time in the second-rate Feiyun Sect, he knew martial arts' value. In Feiyun, he had only dreamed of such treasures.

"Fine! I accept, but the match must be in a month. As for what we bet on, you decide!" Luo Tian said calmly.

Hearing Luo Tian's agreement, Gu Lei's eyes gleamed with joy, thinking: "A month is nothing. I doubt he has any tricks!"

"Good! In a month, when you hear the bell, come to the training ground. You'll know then what we're competing in!" Gu Lei said and strode out of Luo Tian's courtyard.

"Never mind, since I'm here, I'll just settle in," Luo Tian sighed, shaking his head at Gu Lei's retreating figure before entering his room.

Thus, Luo Tian settled into the Gu family. His every moment was devoted to cultivation, and before he knew it, a month had passed.

That evening, Luo Tian sat on his bed, musing: "Li Xiuping needs to enter seclusion for half a year. During that time, he won't threaten me. I must reach his level within six months; otherwise, when he emerges, I'll be in trouble."

"Currently, the Li family must despise me deeply. However, due to the Gu family's protection, they dare not act against me yet. I can focus on cultivation. Since Gu Yun is at Body-Refining Stage Five, the Li family's patriarch must be no less. I need to reach Body-Refining Stage Five to have a chance against the Li family." With his goal set, Luo Tian's desire for power intensified. He reached into his storage pouch and retrieved two jade bottles: one was the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills given by Gu Yun, and the other was a First-Rank Cultivation Pill called "Cui Ti Dan" obtained through his chief guest status.

Chapter Six: The Soul-Calling Bell

The Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills' potency was too strong for Luo Tian to handle currently, so he opted for the Cui Ti Dan instead.

He returned the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills to his storage pouch, intending to save them for when he aimed to break through Body-Refining Stage Four. He then took the Cui Ti Dan, murmuring: "After nearly a month of cultivation, my aura is almost complete. I hope the Cui Ti Dan can push me to the next stage. My physique should allow me to face Li Yuande without being helpless again, and my chances against Gu Lei would be greater!"

Luo Tian had set the bet for a month because he was confident in reaching Body-Refining Stage Three within that time. Only then would he feel assured of winning the bet.

Swallowing the pill, a pure aura flowed down his throat to his dantian. Luo Tian activated his Five Elements Transformation Art, converting the pill's energy.

Not long after, he opened his eyes and swallowed another pill: "The effect is so minimal. I guess the aura required to elevate my Five Elements Body is much higher than for ordinary bodies!"

Saying that, he stuffed four more Cui Ti Dan into his mouth. The five-colored aura in his meridians reached a critical point, causing his face to flush red. Sweat trickled down his cheeks.

A wave of energy radiated from Luo Tian's body, shaking the tea set on the table. A crisp sound echoed from his body.

The sound grew denser, eventually resembling popping beans.

After a moment, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes and roared: "Body-Refining Stage Three, open!"

Instantly, his aura surged to its peak. A massive suction force emanated from his body, drawing in all the surrounding aura and absorbing it into himself.

The courtyard's aura briefly vanished before returning to normal after three breaths.

Luo Tian clenched his fists, feeling significantly stronger than before Body-Refining Stage Two. A surge of confidence washed over him: "Li Yuande, next time we meet, I won't be helpless!"

A night passed like a blink. Dawn had barely begun to break, yet Luo Tian felt no fatigue. He sat cross-legged on his bed to consolidate his cultivation.

"Boom..." The heavy sound of a bell rang out, instantly snapping Luo Tian from his meditation.

The bell's sound seemed to pierce through his soul, imprinting itself in his mind—this was the Soul-Calling Bell, a treasure of the Gu family.

Luo Tian had heard about this artifact during his month in the Gu family. He deduced from Gu Lei's mention of the bell that the contest would involve it.

Hearing the bell, Luo Tian smiled: "This time, let me teach you a lesson. I'll claim that Yellow-Rank Martial Art!"

After a brief tidying, he followed the bell's sound toward the training ground.

At the Gu family's training ground stood a massive ancient bell, exuding an old aura and hanging at the center. Its patterns had worn down over time, showing its age.

Around the bell stood many young Gu family members, including Gu Lei, who was currently using his spiritual sense to strike the bell.

"Gu Lei's so strong! Not only has he reached Body-Refining Stage Three, but his spiritual sense is also formidable. In just a month, he's improved again!" One Gu family disciple gazed at Gu Lei with admiration.

"Indeed, I recall Gu Lei once struck the bell four times. I guess he'll manage at least five this time!" Another disciple looked on with fervor.

The Soul-Calling Bell was a treasure of the Gu family, requiring spiritual sense to strike instead of a mallet. The more times it was struck, the stronger one's spiritual sense. Its other function was enhancing spiritual sense—this was its most extraordinary ability.

Since the bet with Luo Tian, Gu Lei had been intensifying his spiritual sense for a month. Last month he struck it four times; after a month of training, his spiritual sense had improved slightly. He was confident in striking it five times.

Without hesitation, Gu Lei focused his spiritual sense and slammed it against the Soul-Calling Bell...

"Boom..." The bell rang again, shaking people's ears.

Gu Lei's face showed a hint of arrogance as he glanced down at Luo Tian, who had just arrived. His eyes held a taunting look before he concentrated his spiritual sense and struck the bell again.

"Number five!" The Gu disciples cheered, while some who knew about Gu Lei's bet with Luo Tian sneered at him.

Yet Luo Tian merely watched Gu Lei standing proudly by the bell with a calm expression, his face showing no change.

Seeing Luo Tian's indifferent demeanor, Gu Lei's eyes flashed with madness. He gritted his teeth, veins bulging as he finally channeled the last of his spiritual sense and roared: "Sixth strike!"

"Boom..." The bell rang again, causing the Gu disciples to erupt in excitement. Since Gu Qianxue had struck it seven times two years ago, no one had managed more than five. But Gu Lei had achieved this today.

Gu Lei looked at Luo Tian and said proudly: "Luo Xiong, it seems your Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills will change hands!"

"It's too early to say that," Luo Tian said calmly, walking over to the bell and gently focusing his spiritual sense.

The bell rang, and Luo Tian felt a slight headache.

"Ah! I see now— it's not about striking the bell with spiritual sense, but enduring its rebound!" Understanding the principle, Luo Tian's lips curled.

"Hmph! I'll claim that Yellow-Rank Martial Art!"

"Boom boom..." Two more rings echoed. The Gu disciples inhaled sharply, beginning to take Luo Tian seriously. They noticed his calm demeanor and realized he still had energy left.

After striking three times, Luo Tian assessed: "Hmm, my spiritual sense has been strengthened by the Epoch Book. Otherwise, I might have stopped here. But now..."

"Boom boom..." The fourth and fifth rings sounded. Even those standing nearby, including Gu Lei who had planned to embarrass Luo Tian, were stunned. They stared at Luo Tian as if he were a monster.

"Is this guy a monster?" Gu Lei's mouth hung open, unable to believe his eyes. He had thought he'd easily win, but now felt uncertain.

Gu Lei clearly understood the Soul-Calling Bell's rebound force—each strike multiplied it several times. Normally, one would pause after each strike to rest. But Luo Tian didn't stop, striking five times without a break.

"Boom..." The sixth ring echoed. Gu Lei's heart clenched. He knew he wouldn't get the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Pills, and the Yellow-Rank Martial Art might also be lost. He could only pray Luo Tian wouldn't strike a seventh time.

Luo Tian felt some strain now, his mind having been strengthened by the Epoch Book to be exceptionally powerful. Yet enduring the continuous rebound force still caused his head to throb.

Still, he believed he had energy left.

"Gu Xiong, it seems you've lost!" Luo Tian smiled and struck the seventh ring.

The bell's sound spread across the entire Gu family. Gu Lei's face was ashen, his expression bitter as he gazed at Luo Tian: "You've beaten my sister's record. I won't complain about losing!"

In the depths of the Gu family courtyard, some elders praised: "The head's judgment was indeed excellent. This boy is truly remarkable; his future holds no limits!"

Near the training ground, Gu Qianxue's lips curled slightly: "Eight strikes? Interesting."

Eight bell rings shook the entire Gu family. The one responsible for this was Luo Tian, standing by the Soul-Calling Bell with a contemplative expression.

The rebound force of the Soul-Calling Bell had caused Luo Tian's head to ache, but after the pain came a refreshing sensation.

He couldn't help but let out a roar, sending a soul-shaking force from his body. Even Gu Lei felt his spiritual sense tremble.

In an instant, Luo Tian sensed his spiritual sense had expanded significantly. He marveled at why so many Gu family members were alchemists—this Soul-Calling Bell made spiritual sense impossible to ignore.

Previously, Luo Tian could only extend his spiritual sense about thirty meters. Now it stretched over a hundred. This proved the Soul-Calling Bell's power.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, suddenly recalling something. He nodded to Gu Lei and vanished from sight.

He ran straight back to his courtyard, sat cross-legged on his bed, and the Epoch Book reacted again: "The first page gave me the Five Elements Transformation Art. What will the second page give?"

In the bamboo grove courtyard, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, continuously probing the Epoch Book with his spiritual sense.

Soon, his entire spiritual sense turned into a golden ocean. The Epoch Book slowly trembled and unfolded its second page, revealing the characters "Cui Cao Bai Zhang" (Hundred Chapters of Herbal Medicine).

Countless herbal names poured into Luo Tian's mind like ants, even testing his incredible willpower. His head throbbed painfully.

"Ah! It's about alchemy. The Gu family is an alchemical clan, so I should learn this while the chance presents itself. After all, alchemists are highly sought after across Tianyuan Continent," Luo Tian muttered before fully immersing himself.

Time passed another month. Luo Tian loved this tranquil life, and Gu Lei had accepted him, often seeking sparring matches. Though losing a Yellow-Rank Martial Art to Luo Tian had hurt him, Gu Lei's straightforward nature made him accept the loss without resentment.

One day, Luo Tian stood in the Gu family's martial arts hall, holding a jade slip and scrutinizing it. His expression darkened as he muttered: "Damn! A fragmentary scroll. Gu Lei, I'll teach you a lesson when I get out!"

Fragmentary martial arts were typically useless. The first part was weak, but if one encountered the later parts, it could be a powerful technique. However, finding the continuation in Tianyuan Continent was like searching for a needle in an ocean—highly unlikely.

Luo Tian was furious at being tricked by Gu Lei but had no choice. He could barely learn any martial arts now, so he sighed: "Fine, I'll try it first."

Following the martial art's technique, Luo Tian began training in the hall.

The martial arts hall was specifically for Gu family disciples to practice, preventing overpowered techniques from causing unintended damage elsewhere.

Luo Tian's location was a sealed area, said to be arranged by a master of formations to withstand an upper-tier martial art's attack.

A night passed, and Luo Tian continuously practiced the technique, his hands never tiring as they changed positions.

After a night of failure, Luo Tian's face was pale from energy depletion. His hands moved awkwardly, and his fire-elemental aura quietly circulated, creating a scorching sensation around him. A fire dragon slowly formed in his hands and surged forward upon his push.

"Boom..." The fire dragon collided with the barrier, producing a loud explosion and scattering sparks.

"It's indeed complicated. The execution time is too long, and the power isn't impressive," Luo Tian sat on the ground, recovering his energy while disappointment flashed in his eyes.

But he quickly recalled his five-element body and the presence of wood-elemental aura—wood nurtures fire!

Realizing this, Luo Tian wiped his forehead and quickly changed his hands. This time, he subtly infused a trace of wood-elemental aura into the fire dragon.

The fire dragon, initially small, seemed to catch fire from the wood-elemental aura and burned fiercely.

Luo Tian's eyes lit up with joy, roaring: "Blazing Dragon Hand!"

The fire dragon, as if seeking revenge for the barrier's resistance, fiercely collided with it.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed. Luo Tian felt the barrier tremble slightly, and the ground beneath it turned into scorched earth.

Luo Tian stared in awe at the result of his Blazing Dragon Hand, suddenly becoming excited: "No wonder dual-element bodies are considered genius-level—this power is nearly Yellow-Rank Intermediate! Though the energy consumption is high, it's still a decent martial art!"

After整理 his clothes, Luo Tian looked at the bright sky and strode out of the martial arts hall.

As he exited, he saw several people approaching—leading them was Gu Qianxue, the family's prodigy, and beside her stood the plump Gu Lei.

Luo Tian didn't know what had made Gu Lei so excited, but he wasn't one to meddle.

"Lu Tian! Here! Here!" Gu Lei's voice rang out, reaching Luo Tian's ears.

Hearing Gu Lei call him, Luo Tian had to stop and looked at the approaching Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue.

"What's wrong? What happened?" Luo Tian asked, puzzled.

"Isn't it Li Family's trash? They smashed one of our marketplaces and injured the disciples. My sister and I are going to check it out. Come with us!" Gu Lei explained.

"Uh!" Luo Tian was stunned by Gu Lei's words, but considering he was now a guest of the Gu family and hadn't done anything for them yet, and the enemy was Li Family, he nodded and stood beside Gu Lei.

Gu Qianxue saw Luo Tian stand by her brother but didn't stop him. In fact, she was curious to see what talent the head praised.

They quickly arrived at a Gu family market selling herbs, where several disciples lay on the ground, bruised and battered. The marketplace was in ruins.

Seeing this scene, Gu Qianxue's eyes turned cold. Though the Gu family had minor conflicts with Li Family before, they'd never injured disciples so severely.

Gu Qianxue ordered her people to treat the wounded and approached a lightly injured disciple.

"Li Family's people? Where did they go?" Gu Qianxue asked calmly.

Though her voice was calm, it was due to her nature. Those who knew Gu Qianxue understood that the calmer she was, the angrier she was.

The disciple, seeing it was Gu Qianxue, became excited and replied: "It's Li Xiuran. They headed toward the city outskirts!"

"Gu Lei, take the wounded and treat them. I'll go out of the city to see what Li Family is up to!" Gu Qianxue quickly arranged things and rushed out of the city.

Seeing his sister heading toward the city outskirts, Gu Lei's eyes showed concern. Though Gu Qianxue was a four-stage Body-Refining, dual-element wood-fire prodigy, this Li Family clearly had a scheme.

Gu Lei turned his gaze to Luo Tian. After a month of coexistence, he knew Luo Tian's strength far surpassed his own. His tone carried a request: "Luo Tian, can you help me save my sister?"

Luo Tian had been watching Gu Qianxue leave, feeling annoyed at the family's prodigy for being too impulsive. But since he wasn't close to them, he didn't say much. Upon hearing Gu Lei's request, and considering his goodwill toward Gu Lei, he nodded and vanished in a flash toward Gu Qianxue's direction.

Chapter Eight: The Battle Against Li Yuande

Gu Qianxue ran to the forest outside the city, stepping into it when she felt a dangerous sensation. But confident in her strength, she extended her spiritual sense and sneered: "Come out! Don't hide. I didn't expect Li Family to be so foolish, not knowing Gu family members have spiritual senses!"

Before her words ended, a wind sound echoed. Over ten Body-Refining Stage Three warriors emerged from the forest, one of them being Li Xiuran.

"Unexpectedly, I caught a beautiful fish. I thought Gu family would send only that fool Gu Lei!" Li Yuande licked his lips, eyes greedy as he gazed at Gu Qianxue.

"Hmph! Li Xiuran, do you think these Body-Refining Stage Three trash can defeat me?" Gu Qianxue said, disgusted by Li Xiuran's gaze.

"Ha! Have you forgotten what Li Family excels at?" Li Xiuran, seeing his guards had taken positions, revealed a sinister expression.

"Formation!" Gu Qianxue suddenly realized but was too late.

The Li Family guards had already taken their positions, their auras of various colors converging toward the center.

Gu Qianxue kicked off the ground and punched fiercely.

"Stomp stomp!" Gu Qianxue took a few steps back, her eyes sharp as she stared at the formation surrounding her. She murmured: "Xuanguang Jinjin Formation!"

The Xianguang Jinjin Formation was a simple trapping formation, extremely sturdy and difficult to break through. It was a basic second-tier Li Family formation.

Seeing Gu Qianxue trapped in the formation, Li Xiuran jumped with joy: "Hehe, little beauty, when my second uncle arrives, I'll let you go. I don't believe you, Gu Qianxue, can withstand my second uncle and these Body-Refining Stage Three warriors!"

While Gu Qianxue was thinking about breaking the formation, Li Xiuran's words made her feel a bad premonition. If what Li Xiuran said was true, she had no chance of victory.

Thinking this, Gu Qianxue felt regret for her overconfidence. Her only chance was to break the formation and escape, even if it left her with little energy. But if Li Yuande arrived, that would be a problem.

Determined, Gu Qianxue's hands moved rapidly, her aura rising steadily as energy flowed into them.

" Martial Art! Great Sun Palm!" Li Xiuran saw Gu Qianxue's forming martial art and shivered, but seeing the formation was in place, he felt reassured.

A red palm formed in Gu Qianxue's hands. Her long hair flowed as she roared: "Wood nurtures fire, Great Sun Palm! Go!"

The massive palm radiated intense heat, colliding with the formation's barrier.

"Boom... Crack..." A crisp sound echoed as cracks spread across the formation.

Li Xiuran was shocked to see the formation broken, never expecting Gu Qianxue's strength to be so terrifying. Yet when he saw Gu Qianxue, weakened and barely standing, his confidence returned.

Though Gu Qianxue had broken the formation, she was now extremely weak from the martial art's energy consumption. She felt her aura had dropped to less than a third of its full strength.

"Ha! Gu Qianxue, though my guards' formation consumed some energy, they're stronger than you. What are you waiting for? Go and capture this girl!" Li Xiuran's mouth almost drooled, imagining Gu Qianxue being taken by him.

"Hmph! Who dares?" Though weak, Gu Qianxue's aura was fierce. For a moment, it intimidated the surrounding guards into not advancing.

"Who captures her, I'll let them have a second round!" Li Xiuran saw the guards hesitate and became furious.

With great rewards, brave men would emerge. When the guards saw Gu Qianxue's beauty, they felt a fire in their stomachs and shouted as they attacked.

Gu Qianxue, truly a dual-element prodigy at Body-Refining Stage Four, used her remaining energy to charge toward the guards. The forest was soon filled with various colored auras.

Though Gu Qianxue was formidable, she eventually collapsed after defeating seven guards due to energy depletion.

Li Xiuran saw Gu Qianxue fall and laughed joyfully, stepping toward her.

Li Xiuran had coveted Gu Qianxue for days and was eager to reach out toward her face.

Seeing Li Xiuran approach, she knew what awaited her if captured.

Gu Qianxue closed her eyes in despair, trying to summon the last bit of energy for self-destruction. But her arms felt like they were filled with lead and wouldn't move.

"Ao..." A scream echoed, making Gu Qianxue open her eyes. A thin figure stood before her, and Li Xiuran spat blood, flying backward with his arm dangling.

"Lu Tian!" Gu Qianxue's heart leaped with joy upon seeing it was Luo Tian, but soon sorrow filled her.

Luo Tian's strength was Body-Refining Stage Three. Though these guards had exhausted themselves fighting him, they were no match for someone of his level.

Li Xiuran groaned, looking at Luo Tian standing before Gu Qianxue. His eyes burned with hatred, having hated Luo Tian for ruining his plans repeatedly.

"Kill him!" Li Xiuran's voice came from between his teeth.

Luo Tian turned, smiling at Gu Qianxue sitting on the ground: "Don't worry. I'll handle it from now on. Rest first!"

Seeing Luo Tian's smile, Gu Qianxue's despairing mood suddenly felt at ease. She took out a recovery pill and swallowed it, then closed her eyes to recover.

Luo Tian turned back, his face showing fierce battle intent. He rushed toward a guard, his fist wrapped in golden aura and slammed into the guard's chest.

"Crack..." The guard didn't react in time, and his chest cracked with a sound. His body flew backward.

Seeing he had easily knocked out the guard, Luo Tian's eyes glowed with joy and rushed toward the remaining guards.

The guards had already exhausted themselves after setting up the formation and attacking Gu Qianxue. They were no match for Luo Tian, who had a more formidable defense due to his Five Elements Body. They couldn't withstand his attacks.

Before long, Luo Tian had knocked out all the guards, leaving them unable to fight.

Li Xiuran was stunned by Luo Tian's ferocity, wondering how the man who had been helpless against his second uncle Li Yuande a short while ago could now be so powerful.

Luo Tian, having defeated the guards, didn't relax but shouted toward the surroundings: "Old dog! If you don't come out, your nephew will be left here!"

"Unexpectedly, this stinkfish still has some waves. Your spiritual sense is strong enough to find me. I underestimated you!" As the words echoed, Li Yuande slowly stepped out of the forest.

Seeing Li Yuande, Luo Tian's face showed no surprise. He had already sensed Li Yuande hiding nearby.

Li Yuande had sent so many people to deal with any changes but still felt uneasy about his nephew Li Xiuran. He had no children, and he regarded Li Xiuping and Li Xiuran as his sons. Li Xiuping was often in Feiyun Sect, leaving only Li Xiuran. Thus, Li Yuande's favor for Li Xiuran surpassed even his elder brother Li Feihong.

Seeing Li Xiuran in trouble, Li Yuande stepped out of the shadows with a cold smile: "I admit I underestimated you. But today, Gu Yun won't save you!"

Seeing Li Yuande's confident demeanor, Luo Tian couldn't help but laugh: "How? Since Gu Qianxue has no fighting ability, do you think you can take me down?"

Luo Tian's battle intent surged. He let out a roar and directly attacked Li Yuande with a palm strike.

Seeing Luo Tian show no fear and even attack him, Li Yuande's eyes flashed with coldness. A Body-Refining Stage Four warrior wouldn't fear a lowly Body-Refining Stage Three. He clenched his fists and charged at Luo Tian.

A thunderous sound echoed as both men retreated.

Luo Tian felt a surge of joy, confirming he could now match ordinary Body-Refining Stage Four warriors.

Thinking this, Luo Tian's spirit soared and clashed with Li Yuande in combat. They exchanged blows evenly, neither gaining an advantage.

"This annoying kid can fight me on equal terms. If he continues growing, he'll definitely become a threat to my family. I must kill him today!" Li Yuande decided and began channeling his aura, a golden light appearing on his fists.

"Flowing Cloud Golden Fist!"

Seeing Li Yuande use a martial art, Luo Tian quickly activated his aura and used the newly learned Blazing Dragon Hand.

But this time, Luo Tian didn't just use fire-elemental aura; he also added wood, water, gold, and earth elements in the order of Five Elements Mutual Generation. This was his research on enhancing martial arts through dual-element mutual generation, and it was the secret weapon he relied on to challenge Li Yuande alone.

"Five Elements Mutual Generation, Blazing Dragon Hand! Go!" The Five Elements Blazing Dragon Hand erupted, causing the sky and earth to change. The fire dragon came alive, roaring as it soared into the air toward Li Yuande.

Feeling the terrifying power of Luo Tian's martial art, Li Yuande's eye twitched. He immediately turned and ran. This martial art's power had exceeded his understanding, and he knew he couldn't withstand it.

Under the threat of death, Li Yuande pushed his speed to its limit but still couldn't match the Blazing Dragon Hand's speed. More terrifying was the dragon's agility, which locked onto Li Yuande and followed him no matter where he ran. This was because Luo Tian controlled the dragon with his powerful spiritual sense.

Seeing no escape, Li Yuande gritted his teeth and channeled all his aura, shouting: "Dustless Golden Shield."

Three golden auras formed in front of Li Yuande, and he prepared to endure Luo Tian's attack.

Chapter Nine: The First Alchemy Attempt

The Dustless Golden Shield was a defensive martial art of the Li Family. Li Yuande's ability to instantly use three Yellow-Rank Martial Arts proved his strength.

However, the Blazing Dragon Hand Luo Tian used was even more extraordinary. It incorporated five elements in a cycle, its power surpassing ordinary martial arts and even rivaling Yellow-Rank Advanced Martial Arts.

The fire dragon descended, accompanied by three clear sounds. In an instant, it shattered all three shields.

A scream echoed as Li Yuande was pushed ten meters away and lost consciousness, clearly dead.

Li Xiuran stood motionless, his legs trembling uncontrollably. His second uncle was a Body-Refining Stage Four warrior, one of the strongest in Tianyuan City. Yet he had been defeated so badly by Luo Tian.
