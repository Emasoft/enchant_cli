“Boy, I can't continue. I need to recover. The rest is up to you. Good luck!” The voice of the Yin Fish Artifact Spirit echoed in Luo Tian's mind. Though the Tortoise Shell had suffered no damage, the Yin Fish Artifact Spirit had exhausted itself after countless battles. Without it, the Yin Fish Tortoise Shell was merely an indestructible treasure, incapable of unleashing its full power.

“What should I do? Must I resort to my last card so soon?” Luo Tian's mind raced, desperately contemplating the dire situation. After much thought, he realized there was no alternative but to unleash Zhongli Tian's flesh body—otherwise, it would be a death trap. Even the Ancient Heaven Palace wouldn't help.

“Don’t waste words. I’ll send you off. Bring out the Epoch Book, and I'll join the others in their domains!” Ming Xiyan spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were a mere ant.

Indeed, in the later Epoch, Ming Xiyan was an invincible presence. Even the great sects with their deep roots could not compare to him. How much less so was Luo Tian, a genius on the verge of the Epoch?

Beyond the Yin Domain, Thunder Domain, and the Four Sacred Star Domains, seven others faced the same plight. The remaining seven had slaughtered their way to the gates of every sect and clan.

The sects were the core of each domain, protecting most cultivators and countless commoners within their realms.

In the Divine Beast Domain, the demons had no choice but to summon five mid-Epoch and one late-Epoch powerhouse—entirely exhausting their resources. This terrifying force countered a Yin Domain Nine Saints, also of late-Epoch cultivation.

The gods were no less ruthless. The Divine Beast Domain ranked second among the nine domains, and for good reason. Thus, the leader of the Yin Domain Nine Saints appeared before the Divine Clan's Sacred Mountain. His late-Epoch aura erupted, instantly overwhelming Sun Shengtian with despair. He knew even if he ascended to the early Epoch and unleashed the Divine Emperor Sword, he would still be no match for this Yin Domain elder.

Yet the Divine Clan was undeniably a dominant force, perhaps the strongest outside the Yin Domain. Their resources were profound, summoning one late-Epoch, one late-Epoch, and three mid-Epoch protectors to guard the Sacred Mountain.

Other domains mirrored this. The Beast Domain, Starfall Domain, and Chaos Domain all unleashed their resources—so overwhelming was the Yin Domain Nine Saints' power that despair gripped them.

"Great times have arrived!" The leader of the Yin Domain Nine Saints, Ming Haoyan, smiled faintly as he gazed at an old man.

"Old monster, I didn't expect you to still be alive!" Ming Haoyan smiled softly, his body radiating powerful waves as he addressed the Divine Clan's powerhouse.

Sun Hongyang, the Divine Clan's secret weapon and their greatest ace, was an undefeated force even in his prime. After years of self-imprisonment within the Sacred Mountain, he had been stirred from his slumber today.

"Times have changed? This Epoch has no Epoch Master. Who are you?" The aged Sun Hongyang bore a deep sense of dread.

"Ha! My identity is irrelevant. What matters is that I know who you are. Regretfully, no one can stop my path today. You chose to seal yourself away—why not become what you are now, dying!" Ming Haoyan smiled, extending his hands to admire the vibrant energy in them.

"You've chosen to massacre nine domains' people to nourish yourself!" Sun Hongyang's subordinates, their faces contorted with shock, glared at him with murderous intent. They knew well that to maintain their prime, they had to kill countless people.

"Ascendants seek immortality. What's a few deaths?" Ming Haoyan shrugged indifferently.

"Beast!" The Divine Clan's subordinates roared, their killing intent piercing through space as they unleashed a crushing aura toward Ming Haoyan.

"Enough. If you wish to protect your descendants, do as I say. Give me a chance—three days later, bring the Epoch Book to the Four Sacred Star Domains for the final battle. If you win, we'll vanish! You may continue your lives."

"Of course, if we win, you know the consequences!" Ming Haoyan ignored their furious aura, gazing at the Divine Clan's subordinates.

Hearing Ming Haoyan's words, Sun Hongyang furrowed his brow deeply. This proposal was advantageous for them. If the battle took place in the Divine Beast Domain, their resources would be overwhelmed—this domain could not endure such a trial. Sun Shengtian had already informed them that the Divine Beast Domain's population had lost eight out of ten, suffering heavy losses.

Yet if they accepted the challenge, three days would drain them significantly. Their lifespans were nearing their end, surviving only through powerful means. Once they emerged, it would be a death trap.

Ming Haoyan was at the peak of his power. If Sun Hongyang were in his prime, he would not fear him. But now, with his body on the brink of death, losing three days meant no chance of victory.

Other domains' subordinates received the same message. After weighing their options, they all decided to head for the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Ha! I'll await your arrival then!" Ming Haoyan smiled, tearing through space and vanishing from the Divine Clan's sight.

At Fire Domain's Tongtian Mountain, Luo Tian's face was grim. He glared at Ming Xiyan, preparing to unleash Zhongli Tian's flesh body—desperate for a way to kill this late-Epoch powerhouse.

"Die!" Ming Xiyan wasted no words, his gray hand pressing down toward Luo Tian. A fierce glint flashed in Luo Tian's eyes.

"Old fool! Who lives and who dies is uncertain!" Luo Tian chanted, his body radiating brilliant light. But this power did not belong to him.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian launched his attack, the Ancient Heaven Palace thundered. Glowing light spread across space, its emerald hue filling the cosmos with immense pressure.

"What is this?" Ming Xiyan's gaze darkened, recognizing the object as belonging to Meng Lingyun.

"Rebellious disciple!" A cold voice echoed from the Ancient Heaven Palace, like a divine decree. Thunder roared, exploding around Luo Tian and shattering Ming Xiyan's hand.

"Meng... Meng Lingyun!" Ming Xiyan's body trembled involuntarily. He ignored the shattered hand, his gaze fixed on the Ancient Heaven Palace.

He knew Meng Lingyun's strength—after all, he had once been his disciple. He'd schemed against Meng Lingyun for thousands of years before finally killing him.

A man's name and a tree's shadow—Meng Lingyun, even dead, terrified Ming Xiyan.

"Master Meng!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed. If Meng Lingyun had truly awakened, the Yin Domain Nine Saints would be nothing.

"Buzz..." From within the Ancient Heaven Palace, a green jade coffin emerged. Its aura was terrifying, making one instinctively kneel.

"Boom..." The massive jade coffin split the cosmos, pressing down toward Ming Xiyan. Even a late-Epoch cultivator like Ming Xiyan looked grim.

"Back then, you were unmatched. Now, you're just a dead man. Still arrogant before me! Get out!" Ming Xiyan roared, his body emitting a thunderous aura. He unleashed a colossal hand of Epoch power toward the coffin.

In Luo Tian's awe, the green jade coffin clashed with Ming Xiyan's hand.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound continued, splitting the cosmos.

Luo Tian took advantage of the moment to enter the Ancient Heaven Palace's protection. Otherwise, he would have been shattered and lost his cultivation.

"Crack..." The jade coffin shattered Ming Xiyan's hand, striking him in the back. His body crashed thousands of feet downward, his back riddled with cracks. Yet he recovered instantly.

"Meng Lingyun! Ha! Epoch Master, is this all you can do?" Ming Xiyan laughed, his eyes gleaming with joy. He felt Meng Lingyun's strength was less than ninety percent of its former self.

"But it's enough to deal with you. Are you sure you're my opponent after awakening the Ancient Heaven Palace?" Meng Lingyun's voice echoed through space. The coffin hovered without opening.

"Ha! Just this is not enough to make me retreat!" Ming Xiyan闪身, becoming a gray line. He appeared beside the coffin, his gray Epoch power swirling around him as he attacked.

"Go!" A cold voice echoed. The coffin's lid slowly opened, releasing immense pressure that made one submit. A crystalline fist extended from the coffin, clashing with Ming Xiyan's fist.

"Boom..." Ming Xiyan's fist turned to gray mist, floating in space. At the same time, his body retreated again, his gaze deepening.

Light flared as a verdant ancient tree rose from the jade coffin. Its vitality healed even the fractured cosmos.

"Immortal Tree!" Ming Xiyan's eyes flashed with divine light. He recognized the tree as Meng Lingyun's immortal herb.

What shocked Ming Xiyan was the flesh body, resembling a seated figure. Though seemingly dead, it radiated boundless power.

"Rebellious disciple! Since you don't want to leave, stay!" Meng Lingyun's flesh body slowly opened its eyes, vitality flowing.

"Half a body! Ha!" Ming Xiyan noticed Meng Lingyun had only half his body, his eyes gleaming with joy.

"Indeed, he hasn't recovered! I said his body was severed. How could he recover!" Ming Xiyan's eyes held mockery. Though Meng Lingyun remained powerful, Ming Xiyan was confident he could escape even with this half-body.

"Want to know what we did with the other half?" Ming Xiyan spoke, exposing Meng Lingyun's weakness.

Long ago, Meng Lingyun had been schemed against. His body was severed—half sent to the Ancient Heaven Palace by his last strength, and the other half captured by the Yin Domain Nine Saints. What they did with it was unknown.

"Ha! Such a low-level provocation, do you think it works on me?" Meng Lingyun's gaze was deep. He ignored Ming Xiyan's provocation, his hands moving with terrifying waves.

"Ruler of the World!" Meng Lingyun spoke softly. He knew his state and immediately launched an attack.

"Buzz..." Vast Epoch power emerged from Meng Lingyun's hands,凝聚 in space above him.

"What!" Ming Xiyan's eyes changed violently upon hearing Meng Lingyun's low cry.

"You can still use Ruler of the World!" Ming Xiyan gasped, his eyes filled with fear. As a former disciple of Meng Lingyun, he knew the latter's strongest techniques and martial arts.

Ruler of the World was Meng Lingyun's most cherished technique, a skill he'd cultivated after becoming an Epoch Master. It was incredibly powerful.

"Buzz..." Prolific Epoch power凝聚 in Ming Xiyan's awe, forming a human-shaped figure holding a long sword. It resembled an immortal king, radiating supreme aura.

"Hmph! Meng Lingyun, three days later, we nine will meet in the Four Sacred Star Domains to battle eight domains' resources. Hope you can come!" Ming Xiyan retreated, watching the figure solidify. He spoke to Meng Lingyun.

"Want to run?" Meng Lingyun's eyes flashed with coldness. He pointed his finger, the immortal king moving forward, holding a sword of destruction. It attacked Ming Xiyan with immense might.

"Go!" Ming Xiyan pressed his hands into the void, causing space to explode. Without hesitation, he leaped into the void.

The sword's aura did not let him go, following Ming Xiyan into the void. After entering, space tore like a black cloth, with the sword's path marking Ming Xiyan's escape route.

"Disperse!" Ming Xiyan, not wanting to fight Meng Lingyun, did not mean he couldn't withstand the sword's aura. While flying, gray mist surged, forming a gray long knife. It slashed downward, clashing with the sword's aura in space.

Space exploded like the end of days. Countless currents swept out, forming a vacuum within a hundred miles.

"Escaped!" Feeling Ming Xiyan had fled far enough, Meng Lingyun sighed deeply. The immortal king figure vanished into space. Meanwhile, the half-body seated on the Immortal Tree also closed its eyes, its ethereal soul drifting out.

"Master!" Luo Tian wiped blood from his lips, rushing to Meng Lingyun's side. He felt Meng Lingyun's soul had weakened further.

"I'm fine, but be careful. I'm not as strong as I seem. I was injured too much. If Ming Xiyan hadn't seen my peak Ruler of the World and felt its power, he wouldn't have retreated. He was just scared away. If we truly fought, I might not be his match!" Meng Lingyun spoke bitterly.

Hearing Meng Lingyun's words, Luo Tian's heart tightened. He realized Meng Lingyun was already dead. Without the Immortal Tree and other elements, he might not have existed at all. How could he have his former power? The previous strength was just a facade. If Ming Xiyan had persisted longer, he would have noticed the flaw.

"During the final battle, bring me along. Some things must be resolved!" Meng Lingyun spoke again, waving his hand. His soul returned to the half-body, resuming its state of nearing ascension.

"Alas!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He bowed to Meng Lingyun in the jade coffin, his eyes filled with gratitude.

As Meng Lingyun and the Immortal Tree entered the jade coffin, faint purple mist slowly drifted out. Luo Tian's eyes lit up with joy.

"Luo Tian!" Cao Yuanshan's aged body stepped out of the jade coffin. His aura was stable, still at early Epoch cultivation. Luo Tian also felt Cao Yuanshan's cultivation had improved slightly, obviously benefiting from Meng Lingyun's body and the Immortal Tree.

"Congratulations, Master!" Luo Tian bowed to Cao Yuanshan, his eyes filled with respect.

"How is it going?" As soon as he appeared, Cao Yuanshan asked about the nine domains' situation. He knew something big had happened during his time in the jade coffin. He'd seen the battle clearly, and Ming Xiyan's strength had made even a early Epoch cultivator like him feel despair.

Hearing Cao Yuanshan's question, Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. Though he didn't know how other domains were doing, he knew they weren't much better than Fire Domain. Luo Tian then recounted the events of these days to Cao Yuanshan.

"How is the Beast Domain?" Cao Yuanshan's gaze deepened, looking toward the Beast Domain. His heart was full of worry.

"It should be fine... but the Beast Domain's resources have emerged!" Luo Tian said, reassuring Cao Yuanshan not to worry.

"Buzz..." As soon as Luo Tian's words finished, a golden light flew from the void. Golden characters appeared in Luo Tian and Cao Yuanshan's sight.

"Divine Clan, Sun Hongyang. Hope everyone comes to the Divine Beast Domain!" The golden characters were strong and powerful, radiating immense pressure. Luo Tian and Cao Yuanshan's faces slightly changed.

"Who is Sun Hongyang?" Luo Tian was puzzled. Even Cao Yuanshan's gaze was confused, not knowing who this Sun Hongyang was.

"Go. I didn't expect Sun Hongyang to still be alive!" A voice echoed from the jade coffin. The green jade coffin flew into the Ancient Heaven Palace.

Chapter 1201: Farewell

In Fire Domain, golden palaces echoed with buzzes. Figures appeared in Luo Tian's sight.

"Luo Tian!" The figures moved swiftly, surrounding Luo Tian. Their eyes carried concern. Though they were all in the Ancient Heaven Palace, they could feel how intense the battle outside was. Even within the palace, they felt the thunderous sounds. The strength of the Yin Domain's Ming Xiyan had made them feel despair.

"I'm fine!" Luo Tian smiled, looking at the familiar faces. His heart secretly vowed to protect his family and friends no matter the cost.

"Tomorrow, meet in the Divine Beast Domain!" Cao Yuanshan spoke to Luo Tian. He needed to return, check on the Beast Domain's situation, and had some matters to discuss. Luo Tian also needed to say goodbye to his family and friends, for this journey was uncertain.

"Yes, Master. See you in the Divine Beast Domain!" Luo Tian bowed, watching Cao Yuanshan step onto the teleportation array.

"How is it? Luo Tian? Has it ended? Did that Yin Domain powerhouse get driven away or killed?" People surrounded Luo Tian, asking about the battle's result. Fire Domain was too devastated, making people feel deep sorrow and longing for peace.

"Not yet. Or perhaps it's just beginning!" Luo Tian's gaze softened, looking at everyone with a mix of reluctance.

"But I'll handle the rest!" Luo Tian spoke to them, explaining the situation ahead.

"Did the sects and clans agree to a battle in the Four Sacred Star Domains?" Hearing Luo Tian's explanation, people gasped.

"Since all sects and clans have emerged, it should be fine. Why do you need to go? Be a cannon fodder?" Lu Xiong, Lu Nantian, and Long Jian among other elders looked at Luo Tian with confusion.

"Ha! The Yin Domain Nine Saints specifically asked for the Epoch Book, so I must go!" Luo Tian shook his head gently.

Epoch Book? Hearing Luo Tian's words, people's faces changed. That Luo Tian had the Epoch Book was no secret in the nine domains. Though it hadn't shown its power much, just being an artifact of the Epoch Master made it a priceless treasure.

"Can't you hand over the Epoch Book?" Luo Tian's mother, Zhang Qiuyue, loved her son and didn't want him to join the big battle. She believed they should die together as a family.

"Yes, who cares about this big battle? If those old men come, we'll fight. Besides, I don't like the Divine Clan's people. Maybe when you go to the Divine Clan, they'll attack you!" Gu Lei and Zheng Xin also advised him, their eyes full of concern.

They couldn't help now. This was an Epoch-level battle. Even a half-Epoch cultivator was cannon fodder, let alone those at the saint level—no chance to be cannon fodder.

"I won't hand over the Epoch Book. I have a feeling if I do, I'll die!" Luo Tian's gaze was deep. He felt the Epoch Book didn't obey him, but it had become one with him, inseparable.

"Ah..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, people gasped. Their gazes became even more serious.

"Relax. I have a secret weapon! Killing me isn't that easy. Maybe I'll play an unexpected role!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. With Zhongli Tian's flesh body, his confidence had increased.

"Fine. You decide your own fate!" Finally, Lu Xiong frowned and decided the matter. After all, Luo Tian was now fully capable of standing alone—domain master level and had never disappointed them.

"Take care of your wife and children!" Lu Xiong sighed, walking into Tongtian Mountain.

After Ming Xiyan's chaos, Fire Domain was in ruins. Most of the star domain's land had vanished, but Tongtian Continent still remained.

Luo Tian sighed deeply. He looked at his wives and didn't accompany Gu Qianxue, but chose to follow Lu Xiong into Tongtian Continent. He knew his grandparents and parents needed him more. Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and others naturally understood.

Gu Lei and Zheng Xin also accompanied their families. They didn't know what the future would bring, so they cherished these two days of peace.

Luo Tian talked with his parents and grandfather Lu Xiong for a while. Then he met with many friends, returning to his residence.

Looking at the spacious room, Luo Tian's eyes softened. His son Luo Li, though young, seemed more mature now. He sat quietly there. As soon as Luo Tian entered, he clung to his father's body.

"You've gotten heavier!" Luo Tian kissed Luo Li's plump face, his eyes filled with regret. He smiled at Gu Qianxue and the others.

"I wonder how Ting'er is doing. What about Grandpa Gu?" Luo Tian thought to himself, placing Luo Li down.

"You're back!" Seeing the four women, Luo Tian's heart relaxed. He spoke to them with regret and deep affection.

"I'm sorry! If I wasn't here, you..." Luo Tian spoke softly but stopped halfway.

"You won't die. You can't die!" Gu Qianxue's gaze was calm, her voice filled with determination.

Leng Qiuchan, Jiang Suxi, and Sun Mengru also gazed at Luo Tian with deep affection. They clearly agreed with Gu Qianxue's words.

"Reluctant!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He had so much reluctance, but the Yin Domain's nine people were too powerful—so powerful he felt despair.

"Husband, let's go to bed!" Gu Qianxue blushed, the first time she spoke so boldly. But she slowly approached Luo Tian.

The three women did the same, as if releasing their strong shyness. They stood beside Luo Tian and helped him onto the bed.

Luo Li was sent back to the void. The room filled with endless springtime.

That night, the four women were unusually passionate. Even Luo Tian couldn't resist and surrendered, speaking endless words of love.

In the morning, sunlight fell. Luo Tian slowly got up. The four women had already disappeared, like a devoted wife, busily preparing breakfast for Luo Tian. His heart felt even more reluctant. He knew the four wives endured what pain, but he had no choice. If he didn't go, the sects and clans would also force him to separate from the Epoch Book.

After eating the meal prepared by his four wives, Luo Tian led them to Lu Xiong's courtyard. He bowed to Lu Xiong and his wife.

"Go, remember you are Luo Tian. You will always be the pride of Tianyuan Continent and the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Lu Xiong's gaze was full of affection. He waved but didn't leave the courtyard.

On Tongtian Mountain, four statues stood at the peak. Luo Tian walked to their side, his eyes filled with reverence.

Beneath the statues were Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen. They sat cross-legged beneath the statues, their faces showing a faint smile.

"You're still considerate. You didn't forget your master!" Lei Yong's eyes were moist, gazing at his little brother. His gaze held pity—this was their youngest brother, now a domain master level cultivator who had fought for them.

"How is your master?" Luo Tian's eyes held a faint smile. He bowed before the statues of Xiang Ming, Beast Master, and others.

"Not well. Since the Four Sacred Star Domains were destroyed, these statues have been silent!" Zhang Ziping sighed and spoke.

"Hmm." Luo Tian furrowed his brow slightly. Since he had discovered a slight fluctuation in these statues, he had ordered the Four Sacred Star Domains' people to protect them. Though he didn't know what changes had occurred with Zhang Daotian and the others' statues, it was definitely not a bad phenomenon. He even thought they might revive.

Luo Tian shared his guess with Zhang Ziping and the others. From then on, they personally guarded Zhang Daotian's statues, never leaving their side.

"Make sure you come back alive!" Zhang Ziping spoke to Luo Tian, his voice full of concern. His gaze was gentle.

"Master, I have some confidence!" Luo Tian bid farewell to the three and stepped out of Tongtian Mountain, appearing at Fire Domain's domain.

"Buzz..." As soon as Luo Tian appeared, figures emerged from Tongtian Mountain. Their gazes carried respect.

"Brother, take care!" Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi, and others appeared before Luo Tian. They called out to him.

"Brother, Qingqing has already agreed to marry me! So for my happiness, you must come back!" Xu Liyi spoke. Luo Tian was speechless.

"Yes, Luo Tian, hurry back! My son Tianyao and Xiting are grown up. They're waiting for you to give your daughter away!" Zheng Xin spoke shamelessly.

"Go to hell..." Luo Tian kicked Zheng Xin away. That foolish son of Tianyao wanted to marry his Xiting. Luo Tian was quite against it.

"Enough, everyone. Don't look so sad. I'm not going to die!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, a light smile on his face.

"I'm leaving!" He comforted everyone and stepped into the teleportation array, signaling Wan Lingkong to activate it.

Teleportation power acted on Luo Tian's body. He vanished from people's sight. The previous light atmosphere gradually became heavy. They knew the battle that decided the fate of the nine domains was about to begin.

Chapter 1202: Domain Resources

The hum echoed. Luo Tian appeared in the Divine Beast Domain through the teleportation array. His face showed a faint smile. As soon as he appeared, he released his spiritual sense to assess the Divine Beast Domain's situation.

The domain was no better than Fire Domain. The cosmos were filled with a deathly aura, blood and violence spreading across the stars.

"Even the mighty Divine Beast Domain is like this!" Luo Tian sighed. Then he saw several figures standing nearby, his heart immediately tensing.

"Luo Tian!" A call came. His heart relaxed. Purple light spread, and Cao Yuanshan appeared before him.

"Master Cao!" Luo Tian bowed to Cao Yuanshan. Then he looked at the eight old men behind him. He didn't need to think to know these eight people with immense power who made him feel no resistance were the Beast Domain's resources.

"Come, I'll introduce you to our Beast Domain's resources!" Cao Yuanshan led Luo Tian to the eight old men, his gaze also showing respect.

"Little Cao, this is the Luo Tian you mentioned? He's indeed a prodigy!" One old man in purple robes smiled, looking at Luo Tian.

"Respectful greetings to all masters!" Luo Tian bowed to the eight old men, his voice filled with respect.

"Yes. We've heard about your situation. Now that the Yin Domain is in chaos, we'll overlook it. However, after this disaster passes, hope you don't continue like this!" One old man with dragon energy spoke. His aura was terrifying, and he was the leader of the eight resources—Long Clan's powerful resource, Long Xin Yuan.

"Yes!" Luo Tian spoke. His voice was still respectful, but he sighed inwardly: "We'll have to wait until this disaster passes!"

"Did you say the Epoch Book is in your possession?" Before Long Xin Yuan could speak again, an old man stepped out from behind him. His gaze was unkind toward Luo Tian but didn't act immediately.

"This is Feng Feichen from the Phoenix Clan. Be careful with your words!" Cao Yuanshan's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his brow furrow slightly.

"Indeed!" Luo Tian's heart tensed. Though he felt some irritation, he remained respectful and answered.

"Show us the Epoch Book!" Feng Feichen's eyes flashed. He looked at Cao Yuanshan, having heard his transmission.

"Not out of respect, but the Epoch Book is in my mind and not under my control!" Luo Tian spoke. He had some irritation.

"Then I'll take it myself. I want to see what's so special about this Epoch Master's artifact!" Feng Feichen spoke again. Before he finished, he reached for Luo Tian.

"Overstepping!" Luo Tian's eyes turned cold. This person treated him like a piece of meat, wanting to take the Epoch Book from his mind.

What was the spiritual sea? It was a cultivator's sanctuary for their soul. If someone entered it, they would be like having their soul searched—there was no secret left. Feng Feichen's actions had greatly angered Luo Tian.

"Forgive me, I can't comply!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He felt an invisible hand instantly grabbing him, pulling him toward Feng Feichen.

Divine patterns spread. Divine power was everywhere on Luo Tian's body, resisting the immense pulling force. But it had no effect—only slowing the pull slightly.

"Indeed a genius!" The eight resources saw Luo Tian resisting the pulling force. Their faces changed slightly, their gazes different.

"Feng Ancestral!" Cao Yuanshan moved swiftly, appearing before Luo Tian. Purple mist surged from his hands, pulling Luo Tian and slowing him down.

"Ha! Interesting!" Feng Feichen smiled. He was late Epoch, so powerful. Even with Cao Yuanshan's help, it wouldn't change Luo Tian's fate. In an instant, Luo Tian's body was at Feng Feichen's side.

"Don't force me!" Luo Tian's face turned dark. Since they didn't respect him, he had no need to be respectful.

"Brave. I admire your courage. But youth, remember this is a world of strength. Without strength, even the most talented you are still an ant before powerful cultivators!" Feng Feichen smiled, reaching for Luo Tian's head.

"Strength!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed. His gaze met Feng Feichen's, his voice turning icy.

"Enough! It's already this time. Don't waste more time!" Long Xin Yuan appeared beside Feng Feichen, grabbing the hand about to fall on Luo Tian's head.

"Master, it's the Epoch Book!" Feng Feichen looked at Long Xin Yuan, transmitting secretly.

"We're all going to die. What use is the Epoch Book? Fighting over it on a young man's body is losing our dignity!" Long Xin Yuan frowned, transmitting to Feng Feichen.

"Master, you're now at late Epoch. Maybe with the Epoch Book, you could become an Epoch Master. This is the best chance!" Feng Feibai spoke, his voice filled with regret.
