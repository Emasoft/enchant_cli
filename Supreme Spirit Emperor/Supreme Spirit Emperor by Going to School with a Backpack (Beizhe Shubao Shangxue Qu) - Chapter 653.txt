On the other side, a black spear directly pierced through Luo Tian's palm and exited from his shoulder, stained red with his blood before plunging into the ground. Eight.

Huang Luo Bao, at this critical moment, Luo Tian decided to take a desperate risk and use Huang Luo Bao to change the spear's trajectory. As long as he avoided the heart, Luo Tian would not die.

A powerful immortal king at the late stage of his cultivation, Ying Li's death was quite frustrating. After all, Luo Tian was only at the early stage of an immortal king; under normal circumstances, he would have been crushed by a late-stage immortal king.

"Ahh..." A piercing scream rose from behind Luo Tian. Three figures, their faces filled with madness, rushed toward him. It was these three who had thrown the spear in an attempt to save Ying Li, but they never expected Luo Tian to risk his life just to kill Ying Li.

"Relieved!" Fu Hong looked at Ying Li's death, his eyes revealing a hint of satisfaction. No matter what, Ying Li was dead, and the serpent clan would be safe. The serpent clan also had an immortal king at the middle stage, fully capable of countering the attack from the eagle clan.

"Little friend, you should run!" Fu Hong shouted at Luo Tian. He could not move, but Luo Tian still could. Killing Ying Li was enough in Fu Hong's eyes; whether Luo Tian lived or died didn't matter much. This place was a death trap, and anyone who entered would be doomed.

"I wish I could!" Luo Tian's lips twitched. His gaze turned toward the three immortal kings at the middle stage who had now reached him.

They didn't want to waste words. Three terrifying martial techniques rushed toward Luo Tian, aiming to kill him first and then Fu Hong. They believed that if they could kill Luo Tian here, they would still have a chance to eliminate Fu Hong. If Luo Tian could kill Ying Li here, then they too would be able to kill Fu Hong here, and the eagle clan would still remain strong.

"Ten Thousand Demon Body Break!" The demon patterns appeared on Luo Tian's body, and his power instantly surged to the middle stage of an immortal king. This was something Luo Tian had prepared long ago; he had been preparing for this since being chased by three middle-stage immortal kings, fearing any unexpected events.

Crackling sounds echoed as the Ten Thousand Demon Body Break took effect. The first of three earth-shattering martial techniques struck Luo Tian immediately.

Luo Tian's lips twitched. He raised his hands, but there was no time to perform any other techniques; he could only rely on the power granted by Ten Thousand Demon Body Break to withstand the attack.

"Ahh..." The first technique was a golden seal that pushed Luo Tian's body forward, directly sending him into the red region. As he entered this area, a powerful pressure pressed down on his body, making his face grimace. At the same time, the second technique attacked him—a black snake that struck against his body.

Pain...

Luo Tian had only one feeling, which was pain. He felt like his arm was being ground away and that his cultivation power started to be suppressed.

Blood spewed from Luo Tian's mouth as if it were free money, and his entire body was covered with wounds of various sizes.

The third attack came in the form of a black mountain that thunderously descended upon him.

"Let me open!" Luo Tian raised both hands to the sky and met the overwhelming black mountain. A deafening roar echoed above Luo Tian's head, and he fell to the ground, his blood staining it.

"Still not dead?" The three eagle clan's immortal kings looked at Luo Tian with shock, sensing his remaining vitality and spoke in disbelief.

"Crack..." As the three prepared to continue their attack, ending Luo Tian and Fu Hong's lives, the red earth trembled.

Chapter 2450: The Dead Enemy of Long Que

A scorching atmosphere spread, and Luo Tian fell to the ground in a messy manner. His gaze turned toward the three middle-stage immortal kings not far away.

"Did I really have to die here today?" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, but his eyes held a sense of resentment. He struggled to stand up.

Luo Tian knew that if he could withstand their attacks, he would live. Because Yin Yitian and Liu Cheng were coming toward this place; they were getting closer.

Thunderous sounds... As Luo Tian prepared to fight with all his might, the earth trembled. Cracks appeared on the ground, and white mist rose, emitting a scorching atmosphere from the fissures.

"Crack..." The mountain in the distance kept cracking, and a terrifying aura burst forth, pressing upon Luo Tian and others. As soon as Luo Tian stood up, he was immediately suppressed.

Not only Luo Tian but also the three eagle clan's immortal kings' techniques were shattered. That aura was impossible to resist, even if they had upheld the domain, they could not withstand it. It seemed to surpass the level of an immortal king.

A solemn and authoritative call echoed, and red flames surged forth, burning the sky and earth. From the cracks in the ground, a terrifying temperature made Luo Tian's face change.

"This fire!" Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief.

"Little one, lend me your nine-color flame; I need to seal my dead enemy!" A solemn voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, causing his spirit to tremble.

"Magpie!"

"No, it's Master Long Que!" Luo Tian's eyes showed joy as he looked at the mountain that was cracking open, finally recalling who it resembled.

"Don't be surprised. Hurry up and lend me the nine-color flame, or else when my enemy comes out, both of us will die!" As Luo Tian was surprised, Long Que's voice echoed in his mind.

"Okay!" Without hesitation, the flame mark on Luo Tian's forehead flickered with nine-color flames. Following Long Que's instructions, he poured the flame into the ground through the cracks.

"This..." The nine-color flames surged forward. As they continued to be poured in, Luo Tian finally realized that the underground was a great formation, one composed of Long Que's red flame.

"Follow the pattern of the formation and pour in the nine-color flames!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him not dare to be careless. He continuously sent the nine-color flames into it.

"Roar..." A continuous roar echoed, and Luo Tian felt that beneath the red earth was a terrifying fluctuation. It was an overwhelming pressure from the soul.

The king beast had special suppression over ordinary fierce beasts, but Luo Tian could feel that this thing beneath the earth had a special suppression over him. It felt as if it was beyond his level. This feeling was something Luo Tian had never experienced before, like the absolute suppression of his soul.

"An absolutely terrifying existence!" Luo Tian instantly defined this being beneath the ground. He started to pour in the nine-color flames with all his might.

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian could feel Xiao Qi's weakness. The nine-color flames finally filled the formation.

"Long Que, do you think you can seal me? One day I will devour you!" A cold voice echoed, making Luo Tian and others shiver.

"Stay here quietly. I'll go out first. As long as you have the barrier, my nine-color flame will burn you!" Long Que's authoritative voice echoed. As the nine-color flames filled the formation, the cracked ground began to heal. The mountain crashed and broke apart, a red light shooting out and landing on Luo Tian's shoulder.

Gray feathers, dull and lifeless, like a small sparrow with tiny eyes half-closed.

"Master, it's really you!" Luo Tian's eyes showed joy and he couldn't help but speak.

"It's me. You really did it, reaching the immortal king stage!" The sparrow's lazy voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind. However, Luo Tian could sense Long Que's weakness.

The earth returned to calmness, and the scorching atmosphere still remained. However, Luo Tian and Fu Hong were no longer suppressed by that aura but returned to normal. Their cultivation power also resumed.

"Regained!" Fu Hong's eyes showed great joy as he soared into the air and landed beside Luo Tian. Seeing the sparrow on Luo Tian's shoulder, Fu Hong's eyes slightly narrowed.

Fu Hong felt that his cultivation power had returned because of Luo Tian. It was likely due to the sparrow on Luo Tian's shoulder.

Moreover, Fu Hong had a late-stage immortal king cultivation. This sparrow may seem unimpressive but Fu Hong felt an immense danger from it, a natural fear.

"Master, you still need to deal with these three!" Luo Tian spoke to Fu Hong and looked at the three middle-stage immortal kings of the eagle clan who had also recovered.

"Okay!" Fu Hong nodded, his eyes showing coldness. If it weren't for Luo Tian, he would have already died. Now that his cultivation power had returned, Fu Hong could easily deal with these three.

"Little one, how did you end up here? You don't know this is a forbidden place in the immortal realm?" The sparrow's weak voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"I was looking for the ancient heavenly court ruins, Master. It's been a long time since we last met; you look like you're not doing well!" Luo Tian smiled lightly. With Long Que's presence, Luo Tian had more resources than ever before. He would never forget the terror of the world-destroying red lotus.

"This is my dead enemy beneath here. When I left, I felt he followed me. I didn't want to involve you, so I retreated into the Immortal Mountain and he followed me. We fought all the way to this place in the Immortal Mountain!"

"We fought for a month, and finally I sealed him with my red lotus nine-color flame. However, I also sacrificed myself, becoming the formation's eye to suppress this being!"

"I didn't expect you to come. Your blood awakened me from my slumber, and I recognized you. You used your nine-color flame to complete the formation, and my red lotus nine-color flame replaced me as the eye of the formation. That's how I was able to come out!"

"I've been suppressing him for so long, and now I'm tired. Let me sleep; don't disturb me!" Long Que's lazy voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"By the way, you're looking for the ancient heavenly court, right? Go deeper into this place; there should be an ancient transmission array. If I'm not mistaken, it's there! However, it's not a place for people to stay. You'd better not go in!" Before Luo Tian could respond, Long Que's voice echoed again and then went silent.

While Luo Tian was talking with Long Que, Fu Hong started to kill the eagle clan's immortal kings. His hands kept slapping, directly turning them into blood mist that scattered on the ground.

Fu Hong had just killed three of them when Yin Yitian and Liu Cheng arrived. Seeing Fu Hong kill the three eagle clan's immortal kings, their eyes showed joy.

"It's finally over!" Liu Cheng laughed. The remaining people of the eagle clan didn't need Fu Hong to act; they could eliminate them themselves.

Yin Yitian approached Luo Tian, who was severely injured and had difficulty standing up.

"It's okay; after some rest, you'll be fine!" Luo Tian smiled and was supported by Yin Yitian. Together with Fu Hong and others, they returned to the serpent clan.

Seeing Fu Hong and Luo Tian return, the people of the serpent clan cheered, their eyes filled with excitement as they looked at Fu Hong.

"Unite and destroy the eagle clan!" Fu Hong shouted loudly. Liu Cheng and another middle-stage immortal king led the attack on the eagle clan.

"From now on, Luo Tian will be my serpent clan's eternal friend. Please accept this drop of blood; from now on, any serpents who see you will not attack. This is something left by the queen of my serpent clan!" Fu Hong smiled and handed Luo Tian a jade bottle.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. In his courtyard, he started to recover from his injuries, while Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo guarded him. He didn't want to let the incident with Chen Zhong happen again.

Time passed slowly, and after being nourished by elixirs, Luo Tian recovered to about seventy or eighty percent.

In the following days, Luo Tian had Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian accompany the serpent clan to attack the eagle clan. It was more like a plundering mission, as they hadn't obtained anything good in the Immortal Mountain. The eagle clan must have had many treasures.

Fu Hong and Liu Cheng all agreed, as Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo had contributed a lot. It was what they deserved.

After another seven days, Luo Tian didn't waste time and started to refine elixirs. He wanted to enter the ancient heavenly court transmission array alone because he didn't want Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo to accompany him. He didn't know what dangers lay inside, but he had Long Que's protection. However, Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo didn't have that.

Luo Tian knew he would be in danger, but Long Que would probably save him. Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo, however, were uncertain.

The serpent clan had completely destroyed the eagle clan. Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo returned to the serpent clan with considerable gains, quite satisfied.

"These elixirs are for you. Although they're only seventh-grade elixirs, they can restore your lost years of life. From today on, you are free to choose whether to go out or join the Tianyuan Sect in the Central Three Heavens. You can also continue to be a wandering immortal!" Luo Tian called them over and told them he would leave alone.

"Yes!" Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo didn't say anything but bowed to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian said goodbye to Fu Hong and then left the serpent clan, heading toward the ancient heavenly court transmission array that Long Que had indicated.

"Little one, make sure. Although the heavenly court has been destroyed, to enter the ancient heavenly court ruins, you must go through a trial. It's the strongest trial in history. Only the most outstanding talents of ancient times could pass it. It doesn't matter about your cultivation level; only the most extraordinary people have a chance!" Long Que reminded Luo Tian.

Chapter 2451: The Ancient Heavenly Court Trial

"The heavenly court's talent selection is extremely harsh, and the cost you pay doesn't need me to explain; you understand!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Master, won't you help me? What level are you at now?" Luo Tian smiled and replied to Long Que.

"Help? I can't help much right now. After fighting with that bastard and sealing him, I've consumed a lot!" Long Que replied.

"What level were you before? If you fight, would an immortal king peak be your opponent?" Luo Tian walked and continued to chat with Long Que.

It seemed that Long Que hadn't spoken to anyone for a long time and started chatting with Luo Tian.

"I can now produce the power of an immortal king peak. If I recover for a hundred years, maybe I can reach half-step emperor level. That was my previous state!" Long Que said lazily.

"Again, half-step emperor level!" Luo Tian heard Long Que's words and showed admiration. However, he didn't ask further; hearing that Long Que could reach the power of an immortal king peak made him very happy.

"Don't get too excited," Long Que said, "I won't help you. Even if I do, I can't stay for long. If I do, my recovery will be delayed!" Long Que's words made Luo Tian feel a bit sad.

"The heavenly court trial is indeed a good place to train people. You can go in and see; if necessary, I'll save your life!" Long Que said.

"Master knows about the heavenly court trial?" Luo Tian replied, not too disappointed. He felt it was better to focus on improving his own strength.

"Power is the only requirement. As long as you have enough power, you can go up step by step!" Long Que replied, making Luo Tian feel much better. He was quite confident in his power.

"Don't get too excited,"

"The heavenly court trial is beyond your imagination!" Long Que felt Luo Tian's confidence and immediately doused his excitement, but he didn't explain how the trial would be.

Luo Tian wasn't slow. He quickly flew to the place where Long Que had sealed his enemy.

"Ha ha, I never thought fate would finally subdue you!" Long Que laughed and guided Luo Tian to leave this place, heading toward the direction he remembered.

After passing through two mountains, an ancient transmission array appeared before Luo Tian's eyes. His lips twitched.

"Is this transmission array broken?" Luo Tian had a deep fear of transmission arrays. He had experienced problems even with a well-functioning one before. Now, this transmission array was so old that it was hard to notice unless you looked closely. Even the runes were unclear, and Luo Tian really worried about what would happen if he stepped on it.

"Go quickly! This is a rune set by a great immortal. Don't worry!" Long Que transmitted his voice to Luo Tian, calming him slightly.

"Never mind; there's no time!" Luo Tian said softly and stepped into the ancient transmission array.

Boom...

At the moment Luo Tian stepped on it, the formation activated. A violent wind surged around him, and complex runes flowed. Dust was kicked up, revealing the massive transmission array.

A column of light shot into the sky, directly piercing through the heavens. With a thunderous roar, it flew like a meteor into the void.

"The heavenly court..." A whisper echoed in the depths of the Immortal Mountain. A black and white figure stood between heaven and earth, gazing at the flowing light that had entered the sky.

Thunderous sounds echoed. Luo Tian felt a sound of thunder in his ears, and everything around him turned pitch black.

Time passed. After a quarter of an hour, Luo Tian finally escaped the transmission and found himself in a desolate place.

A towering mountain appeared before Luo Tian's eyes. Its peaks were barren, with no signs of life. However, he could feel that this mountain had once been magnificent and even saw scenes of ancient geniuses fighting on it.

"The heavenly court trial has begun. If you pass, you can become a disciple of the heavenly court!" A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. He was stunned.

"So quickly?" Luo Tian muttered, but his heart sighed deeply. The heavenly court must have been very powerful back then. However, the trial path was still ahead, and the heavenly court had already disappeared, no longer as powerful as before.

On the mountain's peak sat a figure in meditation. He held a golden sword and radiated an ethereal aura.

Dressed in white robes, his long hair flowed like a celestial being. At the moment Luo Tian appeared, the figure slowly stood up.

"Go on, young man! Let me see your progress these years!" Long Que's voice filled with anticipation echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian's eyes showed determination. He leaped into the air and landed on the mountain peak, standing before the figure.

Upon close inspection, Luo Tian realized that this figure was not a person but had been formed by someone using special methods.

"Strong!" Luo Tian immediately felt the power radiating from him.

"Not bad, young man. It's been a long time since anyone came to take the trial!" The figure smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Do you know who he is?" Long Que's voice carried a nostalgic tone, as if recalling something and became serious.

"Human Emperor Fuxi!" Luo Tian's heart suddenly tightened, his eyes looking at the young man before him.

"Yes, this trial is to confront the great beings of the ancient heavenly court. Therefore, you can meet many people from that time and understand how terrifying the ancient heavenly court was!" Long Que spoke.

"This is even older than Guiguzi!"

"I heard that Fuxi was the first emperor of the human race, right?" Luo Tian's heart trembled. This was a legendary figure.

"Approximately," Long Que said, "I had some connection with him. However, he eventually perished!"

"As to how he died, I don't know. That memory was erased. All I know is that after this catastrophe, there were no emperors in the world!" Long Que spoke softly and fell silent.

"Come on. Although it's just a fragment of my will, it should be enough!" The figure smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." As he spoke, Fuxi wielded his golden sword and launched a simple but overwhelming strike toward Luo Tian.

"Is this playing with me?" Luo Tian's lips twitched. Longyuan appeared and met Fuxi's golden sword.

"However, I can also pass this trial path like the ancient ancestors!" Luo Tian's eyes then showed determination.

"Crack..." Thunderous sounds echoed on the mountain peak. Luo Tian took a few steps back, and Fuxi's body also retreated two steps, his eyes showing surprise.

"Very impressive. Come again!" Fuxi laughed and raised his golden sword, which burst into thousands of sword shadows, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Fast!" Luo Tian exclaimed but didn't waste time. His Longyuan sword continuously moved, fighting against Fuxi.

...

While Luo Tian was battling Fuxi, the ancient ruins exuded a decaying atmosphere. There were 108 peaks, and on each peak sat one person, radiating powerful energy. The sky trembled, and some chaotic skies became pure. The scene of Luo Tian and Fuxi's battle appeared in the sky.

"Another person has entered the trial path!" The 108 people, both men and women, showed interest in watching Luo Tian's battle with Fuxi.

"This luck is unmatched. He just entered and met the human emperor!"

"Back then, even the first one was no different!" An old man sitting on a mountain peak spoke. His aura radiated an ancient and weathered feeling.

"This kid, I've seen him before. He's a reincarnation body, from the Nine Domains!" A white-cloaked woman smiled and looked at the scene.

"The Nine Domains?" Upon hearing the woman's words, several people on the peaks showed interest and looked at the scene in the sky.

"What do you eat to grow up so strong? This kid isn't weak either!" A one-eyed old man spoke, his other eye covered by a black eye patch.

A middle-aged man smiled and looked at the figure continuously battling against the human emperor Fuxi.

"However, many people have accidentally entered the trial and failed. The human emperor's stage is difficult for many to pass. This kid is really unlucky!" People whispered among themselves without much concern.

"He will succeed!" The middle-aged man spoke, and the woman also showed a hint of confidence.

The middle-aged man wore white robes. His gaze was fixed on the scene in the sky, and he was at one of the 18 peaks of the ancient heavenly court.

"Because he is a reincarnation body!" The woman spoke, looking at Luo Tian's figure in the scene and whispering.

If people from the Nine Domains saw these individuals, they would be terrified because many of them were only seen in portraits.

...Crack...

The sword light exploded. A black and golden clash continued, with Luo Tian constantly retreating under the human emperor's pressure. His heart was amazed at how impressive the human emperor truly was. His sword techniques were exquisite, and they had exchanged thousands of strikes in a short time. Luo Tian had expended great effort to withstand it, but the human emperor seemed to still have energy left.

"Forming the World!" With a thunderous roar, Luo Tian activated Forming the World. The massive foot fell down, and he used the蛮七踏 (Seven Stomps of the Barbarian) to stomp toward the human emperor.

"Is this a technique from Xiao Gu?"

"This is a barbarian's martial art!" The ruins had people exclaiming, their eyes filled with disbelief. They then looked toward Gu Tian Shu's position.

"Are these still the techniques from the Nine Domains?" Gu Tian Shu muttered to himself, his eyes fixed on Luo Tian, wanting to see what progress he had made.

"Buzz..." The golden sword light rose from the human emperor's hand, clashing against Luo Tian's descending foot.

"Boom..." A deafening roar echoed. Luo Tian's massive body retreated, and blood spewed from his thigh.

Chapter 2452: The Power of Strength

Luo Tian's face was grim. He looked at the human emperor Fuxi, who stood with his hands behind his back and did not continue to attack but instead looked at Luo Tian.

"Come on, again!" Fuxi spoke softly. His golden sword radiated a radiant light.

"Barbarian God's Seven Stomps..." Luo Tian's eyes also showed battle spirit. This formidable opponent was definitely a good opportunity to train himself.

His massive foot took another step forward, still rushing toward Fuxi. This made Fuxi's face show interest.

"Buzz..." The golden sword light rose again, expanding in power. It clashed against Luo Tian's massive foot.

The sky roared, and the winds reversed. Luo Tian took another step back, blood flowing from his mouth. The golden sword light exploded before him.

"Again!" Luo Tian roared, and the seventh stomp was suddenly unleashed. Three leg shadows, carrying a terrifying fluctuation, merged together and descended upon the human emperor.

But what Luo Tian received was still a single strike. His body kept retreating again and again.

Fourth stomp... Fifth stomp...

Luo Tian continued to take steps forward, each step producing a more terrifying sound. His thick foot shattered the void and kept landing on the human emperor's head, clashing with the sword light he had thrown.

Boom... Boom...

A continuous sound of thunder echoed on the mountain peak. After six stomps, they were all shattered by the human emperor Fuxi's single strike. Luo Tian's massive body almost fell off the mountain peak.

"变态, no wonder he was a human emperor!" Luo Tian's lips twitched. He took the seventh step, which was the Seven Stomps of the Barbarian God to Shatter Eternity.

"This kid, he even knows my martial arts and has made some changes. He fused the same method of enhancing strength together!" A tall, strong old man spoke, his eyes looking at the scene in the sky.

"It should be almost there. If he passes this human emperor stage, maybe he can go further!" A strong person spoke.

Seven leg shadows made the world change. The human emperor's face showed a touch of admiration, his eyes revealing appreciation. His golden sword emitted a sound like a dragon's cry.

"Imperial Sovereignty Over the World!" The human emperor no longer used a casual strike but instead activated his martial technique. A royal aura radiated from him, an aura that only a long-standing top-level strength could possess. It dominated all living beings and ruled over the heavens.

"Buzz..." The golden sword light, carrying a terrifying power, clashed with Luo Tian's foot that had shattered eternity.

Time seemed to freeze. The sky roared, and the laws of the world were destroyed. Luo Tian's divine body was shattered and exploded in the collision.

"Boom... Boom..." The mountain beneath them also collapsed, and dust filled the air, concealing both their figures.

"Ah, this kid really made the human emperor use his martial technique. It seems he has passed!" The 108 people showed surprise, watching the swirling dust in the sky.

The dust cleared. Luo Tian coughed blood and looked at the figure within the swirling dust, still standing proudly with a smile.

"So terrifying!" Luo Tian was shocked by the human emperor's strength. How could this be a person? He was confident that his Seven Stomps of the Barbarian God combined with his chaotic wind would be able to crush an early-stage immortal king, even possibly wounding a middle-stage one. But the human emperor was still standing there as if nothing had happened, while his two legs had lost all sensation and felt like they were broken.

"You did well. It seems you've passed!" The human emperor smiled and spoke. The mountain that had been shattered by the two of them was reformed, and the figure slowly flew up to the mountain peak. His eyes showed a touch of loneliness.

"Go on... Perhaps you won't be so lucky next time!" The human emperor spoke softly, his gaze looking into the distance. Luo Tian couldn't tell what the human emperor was thinking.

"Is this really just a fragment of his will?" Luo Tian muttered to himself, feeling that the human emperor was no different from a normal person.

"You did well. Although this guy is just a fragment of his will, he was once an immortal emperor and a top-tier one. His level is much higher than yours!" Long Que comforted Luo Tian.

"Are you not going to leave? Do you want me to fight with you again?" The human emperor Fuxi smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Master, I'm not unwilling to leave. My legs are numb!" Luo Tian's lips twitched. The seventh stomp of the Barbarian God was quite burdensome for him.

"Then stay here!" Fuxi didn't stop Luo Tian but instead continued to sit on the mountain peak, gazing into the distance.

Luo Tian showed reverence and sat cross-legged to recover his injuries.

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian's wounds gradually healed. However, Fuxi remained seated there, as if a statue.

After three hours, Luo Tian's wounds had finally healed. He stood up and looked at Fuxi who was still seated.

Upon seeing this, Luo Tian's body slightly trembled. At this moment, Fuxi radiated an ethereal aura. His entire body seemed like a celestial god, with royal power overflowing and making people feel the urge to worship.

"Worldly things are only illuminated by the sun. People are only as great as Fuxi!" A series of murmurs echoed from Fuxi's mouth. His arms continuously moved, and his aura fluctuated.

Luo Tian's heart was shocked. He looked at Fuxi standing on the mountain peak and felt a strange sensation, as if even the heavens would have to yield before such a powerful being.

"What is this technique?" Luo Tian's heart was terrified. The method Fuxi had manifested was something he couldn't comprehend. For Luo Tian, it was too difficult.

"Watch carefully. This is the Taihao Fuxi's technique. Although it seems simple, it contains the ultimate truth of the Dao. If you can understand it, then do so; if not, there's no need to worry. Very few people in the world can comprehend it!" Long Que spoke again, his voice filled with nostalgia.

Luo Tian had two advantages over ordinary people. The first was his unique and exceptional physique, and the second was his high level of comprehension. From how he could deduce the great trends of heaven and earth to understand the Dao of Heaven and Humanity, it was clear how high his comprehension was.

However, at this moment, Luo Tian could not comprehend even a fraction of Fuxi's manifested technique. It seemed simple but actually contained countless laws.

"Taihao Fuxi's Technique!" The 108 people watching the scene in the sky showed surprise.

"This is a technique created by the human emperor. Only those with the bloodline of the human emperor can cultivate it!" They then sighed and also couldn't understand.

"Bloodline?" Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed. Now he was an immortal king, and in the immortal realm, he could also see the problem.

Luo Tian suddenly thought of something. That was when the Eastern Emperor's Mountain had captured Fuxingyang but hadn't killed him, instead imprisoning him. They said it was a bloodline issue.

"The Eastern Emperor's Mountain claims to be descendants of the human emperor. They must have the Taihao Fuxi's technique. This technique is no worse than my Mind Demon Scripture. But why didn't anyone from the Eastern Emperor's Mountain know it?" Luo Tian muttered to himself, thinking about this issue.

"The current Eastern Emperor's Mountain is not the true descendant of the human emperor!" Luo Tian felt a shock in his heart, forming a bold guess.

"Star Moon Clan is the true descendant of the human emperor?" Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, thinking about this possibility. This was why the Eastern Emperor's Mountain wanted to study Fuxingyang's bloodline.

Luo Tian sighed deeply. How powerful the human emperor had been back then, and yet his descendants ended up in the Nine Domains.

Realizing he couldn't understand it, Luo Tian stood up and walked around the mountain peak toward another mountain.

"Good luck. I didn't kill you, don't be careless!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him cautious again.

"You've managed to make Fuxi use his Imperial Sovereignty Over the World. That shows your strength is very strong. Fuxi's peak power once swept away many forces and unified the human race!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Yes," Luo Tian nodded. He could also feel the power of that final strike and sensed that Fuxi hadn't used his full strength. It seemed he had held back a lot, otherwise that strike would have injured him.

"If they're all this strong, can I go back early?" Luo Tian's lips twitched. He walked through the forest and quickly reached the second mountain.

It was also a figure, but this one was unusually strong. Even sitting there, it gave Luo Tian a sense of pressure.

His muscular body slowly stood up, radiating explosive power. Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed.

"Stronger than Chen Zhanbao!" Luo Tian's lips curled. He never expected there to be someone stronger than Chen Zhanbao in the world.

"Fight!" A thunderous voice echoed from the mountain peak. His face was green, and his eyes were also green. His gaze showed excitement.

"Let me hit you three times; that's considered passing!" Seeing this figure, he held a green board axe and shouted.

"Master, can we negotiate? One hit is enough! You're so strong; how could I withstand your three hits!" Luo Tian shouted, trying to bargain.

"Kill!" However, the answer was a solemn voice. The green figure descended from the mountain peak and pressed down with his axe.

"Your grandfather!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath. A feeling of oppression instantly passed through his mind, getting closer and closer.

"Buzz..." Longyuan roared and appeared in Luo Tian's hand. The wide blade swung, sending a black sword light toward the green figure.

"Crash..." However, Luo Tian's powerful sword light didn't even stop the green figure for a moment. In an instant, the green axe landed on Luo Tian's front and collided with Longyuan's large sword.

"Crack..." A thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian's ears. The world roared, and his legs felt weak. Longyuan's large cold blade almost dislocated Luo Tian's shoulder, and blood flowed out continuously. The white bones were exposed.

Chapter 2453: The Power Used
