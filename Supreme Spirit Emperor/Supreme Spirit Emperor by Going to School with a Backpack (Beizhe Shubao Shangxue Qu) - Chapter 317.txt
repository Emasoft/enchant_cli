“Haha, Mengchen, this is truly a great honor for me!” Fu Xingyue laughed heartily as he approached Luo Tian, repeatedly patting his shoulder.

“How does the Reincarnation Heaven Art feel?” Fu Xingyue asked with a smile, drawing everyone’s attention to Luo Tian.

“Little one, do you remember what you said before—that after mastering it, you would pass it on to me!” Fu Xingchen’s face darkened as he approached Luo Tian, his eyes flashing a threatening glint. For years, he had struggled to grasp it, yet Luo Tian achieved success with a single insight—this ignited Fu Xingchen’s deep resentment.

Not only resentment, but intense hatred. Luo Tian’s success implied Fu Xingchen’s inferiority in comprehension.

“Third prince, I haven’t mastered it yet!” Luo Tian feigned innocence, gazing at Fu Xingchen with a slight shake of his head.

“What?” Fu Xingchen’s face flushed with anger, staring at Luo Tian in disbelief. He hadn’t expected such a tactic—Luo Tian flatly denied it.

“Elder third, go ahead. What’s not yours, don’t yearn for,” Fu Xingyue said with a triumphant smile, his words laced with mockery.

“Little one, do you think your brother’s support makes me hesitate to act?” Fu Xingchen’s eyes flashed a cold glint, transmitting his words telepathically to Luo Tian.

“Third prince, I truly haven’t mastered it!” Luo Tian adopted a defiant demeanor, refusing to admit it. Fu Xingchen could do nothing against him.

“Fine, you wait. This is my first loss—your regret will come!” Fu Xingchen replied before casting a meaningful glance at Luo Tian and leaving the crowd.

“Xingyue Guard Commander? Mengchen? Excellent!” After Fu Xingchen departed, Fu Xingyang smiled gently as he approached Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

“Danger!” Luo Tian’s heart tightened. This man, who appeared so gentle, sent a chill through him the moment he approached.

“Few people make me feel danger,” Luo Tian mused, then bowed respectfully to Fu Xingyang.

“During the Three Armies Competition, I hope you’ll show mercy,” Fu Xingyang chuckled lightly and, without further words, left with Kou Tiande.

“Did you sense it? My elder has murderous intent toward you,” Fu Xingyue never spoke to Fu Xingyang directly, transmitting this to Luo Tian.

“Your second prince means that the one who attacked you after falling from the spatial rift…,” Luo Tian transmitted back, only to see Fu Xingyue shake his head and point toward the sky.

“Great power watches over us!” Luo Tian’s heart tightened, his gaze turning to Fu Xingxuan approaching slowly.

“Initially, I hadn’t realized your talent was so good! Can this art be passed on?” Fu Xingxuan smiled radiantly, addressing Luo Tian.

“Is this a beauty trap?” Luo Tian gazed at the exquisite Fu Xingxuan, biting his tongue to stay alert. He smiled: “Princess, I truly haven’t mastered it!”

“Even if I gave it to you, you wouldn’t master it. This is my exclusive art!” Luo Tian inwardly sneered.

“Hmph, second brother, after the competition ends, have him find Xiao Ding. If he fails, have him crippled!” Fu Xingxuan sneered at Fu Xingyue.

“Xingxuan, don’t be foolish,” Fu Xingyue chuckled lightly, dismissing her words as jest.

“Everyone, disperse!” Fu Xingyue addressed the onlookers, leading Luo Tian toward the Xingyue Pavilion.

Throughout their journey, Fu Xingyue recounted all the commotion Luo Tian had caused. Luo Tian was secretly awestruck.

“Hmph, such a situation hasn’t even stirred the Xingyue Divine Emperor,” Luo Tian mused in quiet confusion.

“Still, your commotion is a good thing. Father intended to test our three subordinates’ abilities. You’ve demonstrated your talent. If you win the Three Armies Competition, I’m eight-tenths certain!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes gleamed with confidence.

“Rest today, and tomorrow, practice with the Xingyue Guards,” Fu Xingyue instructed Luo Tian.

“No time for practice!” Luo Tian’s gaze deepened, his voice carrying a hint of confidence.

“Hm?” Fu Xingyue was puzzled by Luo Tian’s words, gazing at him.

“Because I’m preparing to ascend to the Early Epoch!” Luo Tian chuckled, his voice laced with excitement.

“So soon?” Fu Xingyue’s body halted, his eyes wide in disbelief. He clearly remembered Luo Tian had only ascended to the Half-Epoch recently.

“Do you have a chance?” Fu Xingyue’s expression turned solemn, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian. He knew the Epoch Trial’s terror well.

“Yes, a little. Mastering Reincarnation Heaven Art brought great gains. However, if I had the Reincarnation Heaven Art’s stone tablet, my chance would be greater!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with anticipation.

“The Reincarnation Heaven Art’s stone tablet?” Fu Xingyue knew Luo Tian had indeed mastered it. If Luo Tian truly ascended to the Early Epoch, there was no need for the Three Armies Competition. Against an Early Epoch master, any strategy was futile.

“I’ll try to find a way. Wait for me one day!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes turned resolute, addressing Luo Tian.

“Thank you, Prince,” Luo Tian quickly expressed gratitude, bowing respectfully to Fu Xingyue.

“By the way, you can choose the Xinyun Pavilion for your trial. It’s a designated place for us to undergo trials, saving you the trouble of traveling elsewhere!” Fu Xingyue smiled, addressing Luo Tian before parting to find the stone tablet for him.

“Truly kind to me. I wonder if, when we meet on the battlefield, I’ll have the heart to kill you!” Luo Tian sighed longingly as Fu Xingyue departed. He knew obtaining the stone tablet would cost Fu Xingyue dearly.

Luo Tian sighed again, returning to his residence. As for the claim of entering the Epoch Realm, he was already in the Early Epoch—only pretending. As for how to feign it, Luo Tian wouldn’t go to the Xinyun Pavilion; who knew if someone was secretly watching there, risking exposure?

Fu Xingyue’s efficiency was unmatched. That very night, Luo Tian received the stone tablet.

This tablet was a treasure-level artifact, crafted by the Master of Severing Heaven. Naturally, it wasn’t ordinary. However, its aura was concealed by the Master of Severing Heaven, Lord Junmushang, making it appear as a common heritage tablet.

Luo Tian learned from Junmushang’s inscriptions that this tablet was the key to unlocking the Master of Severing Heaven’s true heritage site.

Luo Tian stored the tablet, a smile on his face. He spent the night in cultivation. The next morning, he vanished from his room, rushing to the Alchemy Hall.

Chapter 1301: The Wall of Pills

Luo Tian transformed back into Xiao Ding’s guise, entering the Alchemy Hall. It was eerily empty. He shook his head gently, gazing at Fu Tianqing, who sat behind the counter listlessly.

“Junior again disturbs you, Master!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, stating his purpose directly.

“Not in the Alchemy Hall? That won’t work. Your flame isn’t as effective as the Thunder-Defying Flame! Besides, I want to witness your alchemical skills!” Fu Tianqing rubbed his hands, excitement in his eyes. For days, the entire Divine City searched for Xiao Ding—such a young alchemist was rare. He wished to see Luo Tian’s techniques, perhaps gaining insight.

Yet the entire city had been scoured without success. Now that he’d finally caught Xiao Ding, he wouldn’t let him go easily.

“Hmph, if Xingxuan knew I saw this kid and didn’t tell her, she’d tear me apart!” Fu Tianqing mused, shaking his head at Luo Tian.

“Master, according to regulations, I can exchange merits for herbs. This time, I need to use the Thunder-Defying Flame!” Luo Tian asked respectfully.

“Normally, that’s true. But I set the rules of this Alchemy Hall. I decide how they go!” Fu Tianqing insisted.

“Old fox!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly, but smiled warmly. “Master, if you wish to watch my alchemy, I’ll open the array next time. But this time, it’s impossible. I can pay more merits!”

“Impossible! How about this: I won’t trouble you. I’ll accompany you out of the city, no others. You alchemize, and I’ll guard!” Fu Tianqing smiled.

Luo Tian said nothing. After much back-and-forth, Fu Tianqing refused to budge, frustrating Luo Tian.

“Hmph, I heard you’ve been making a name in Xingyue Divine City recently. My niece has been searching for you everywhere!” Fu Tianqing picked up a token, tapping it.

“Fine, I won’t alchemize!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, vanishing from the Alchemy Hall.

“Xiao Ding has returned!” Fu Tianqing smiled, tapping the token. His voice echoed into Fu Xingxuan’s ears.

“Xiao Ding! Have you finally returned?” Fu Xingxuan, seated in her palace, felt a chill.

“Xiao Ding has returned. Search the entire city thoroughly! Reward those who find him!” Fu Xingxuan’s face turned cold, instructing her attendants.

“Xiao Ding has returned?”

“That’s the one who ditched the princess!”

“Yes, that arrogant Sage-Level Alchemist! Daring to return!” As Fu Xingxuan’s order spread, the city stirred. Her admirers scoured every corner, seeking Luo Tian.

“Old fool!” Luo Tian, in a secluded spot, had just restored his commander’s form when he felt figures passing by.

“Huh? Strange. I saw a strange figure running here, but it vanished in an instant!” Two young figures looked puzzled, spotting Luo Tian emerging from the corner.

“Respect the Grand Commander!” They bowed immediately upon seeing him.

“What are you two doing here?” Luo Tian glanced at the youths, noting their Xingyue Guard uniforms. He felt irritation.

“We’re searching for Xiao Ding!” One youth replied, eyes respectful. Recently, two figures had dominated Xingyue Divine City: Xiao Ding, hailed as the youngest Sage-Level Alchemist, surpassing Princess Xingxuan and even rejecting her recruitment. The other was their Grand Commander, more terrifying still—he’d mastered the Reincarnation Heaven Art that Third Prince Fu Xingchen had failed to grasp for years. He’d summoned an Epoch Rain, elevating the city’s strength. Even now, many still struggled with the rampant growth of plants from the Epoch Rain.

“Xiao Ding? You’re searching for Xiao Ding too? Remember, you are Xingyue Guards—brothers. Yet you follow the crowd and betray your own kin!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his gaze stern.

“Grand Commander, it’s not just us. Four-fifths of the rotating shifts are searching!” A young guard replied, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s heart ached. He raged at the two guards.

“You’re bored, aren’t you? Good! Since my actions caused so much plant growth, go and pull weeds for me!” Luo Tian kicked them far away.

“Damn it, Fu Xingxuan, you little bitch. One day I’ll deal with you! And that old bastard, even more stingy than Nan Gongfu!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly, his face dark as he returned to his residence.

The first thing Luo Tian did upon returning was summon Deputy Commander Fu Zhiming. For an hour, the Xingyue Guards heard roaring and curses from Luo Tian’s residence.

When Fu Zhiming emerged, his face was red, eyes dark, and his aura fierce.

Then, one by one, Xingyue Guard sub-commanders entered Fu Zhiming’s residence. He scolded them out, and they left like whipped dogs, rushing to the military field.

“First squad, return immediately! You’re bored, aren’t you!”

“Second squad assemble. You, who missed one breath, go pull weeds from Grandma Li’s house!”

Each sub-commander barked orders at the Xingyue Guards. The guards dared not breathe, knowing their sub-commanders had been scolded like dogs.

Instantly, the Xingyue Guards became a striking sight in Xingyue Divine City. Wherever weeds grew, there they were, puzzling the city’s people.

Luo Tian smiled in satisfaction at the bustling Guards. He then stopped worrying, turning his thoughts elsewhere.

“Fu Tianqing’s old fool—apparently he wants to watch me alchemize. I don’t have enough herbs for the Severing Heaven Pills!” Luo Tian mused, thinking of how to obtain herbs.

“I, a Sage-Level Alchemist, won’t be defeated by a few herbs!” Luo Tian declared aloud.

“Wall of Pills!” Suddenly, an idea struck him. His eyes brightened.

“Old fool! You won’t let me exchange herbs, so I’ll earn them myself!” Luo Tian smiled, his form flickering as he headed toward the Alchemy Hall again.

This time, he didn’t transform into Xiao Ding but adopted another guise, entering the Alchemy Hall.

“Hm?” It was dusk. Fu Tianqing studied a scroll, surprised to see Luo Tian.

“What’s different today?” Fu Tianqing mused. He hadn’t expected anyone to come at this hour.

“What do you need?” Fu Tianqing asked, setting the scroll aside. His gaze was lazy as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Junior wishes to see the Wall of Pills!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his face respectful.

“Oh? Few young people want to learn alchemy now!” Fu Tianqing smiled, his gaze encouraging.

“Junior only understands a little. I study it occasionally during cultivation. However, our royal clan finds alchemy difficult. Junior just wants to try!” Luo Tian replied quickly.

“Hm, if all were like you, our Xingyue Divine Clan’s alchemists wouldn’t be so rare!” Fu Tianqing felt relieved.

Luo Tian understood. He produced a token with ten thousand merits, handing it to Fu Tianqing.

“Hm!” Fu Tianqing was satisfied with Luo Tian’s tact. He effortlessly allocated ten thousand merits without asking his name, assuming he was just a novice.

Luo Tian took the token and entered the Alchemy Hall’s back, heading toward the Wall of Pills.

Along the way, he saw no one. He was glad; too many people wasn’t good.

Soon, Luo Tian rounded the mountain and reached the Wall of Pills. No one was around—those who should have感悟 it had already done so, like Fu Xingxuan and Fu Tianqing.

Chapter 1302: Breaking Records

The Wall of Pills was known to all in Xingyue Divine City, yet few came. Alchemy had declined; few wished to learn its secrets.

The Wall of Pills was a mountain carved into a flat plane. It held countless methods for identifying herbs and alchemical formulas. Those wishing to learn could感悟 it, mastering many herb properties.

Another feature was earning merits: one could carve herbs not recorded on the Wall. Upon reaching a certain number, merits were awarded.

Many had come to exchange merits, but over time, the Wall’s herb varieties grew. Since Fu Tianqing took charge of the Alchemy Hall ten years ago, no one had carved herbs onto it.

Carving herbs earned both merits and herbs. Luo Tian gazed at the mountain wall, smiling.

The wall bore countless names. The first was Fu Tianqing, with thirty million herbs recorded—meaning he had carved thirty million previously unrecorded herbs.

“Bestowed a Sage Herb!” Luo Tian’s eyes sparkled, watching Fu Tianqing’s reward after carving thirty million herbs.

Luo Tian was confident in his herb identification. The Nine Realms’ alchemy preserved more thoroughly than the Origin Realm. In the Nine Realms, several opportunities had allowed Luo Tian to recognize an astonishing number of herbs.

“Let me see how many I can carve!”

“But first, master all the herbs and formulas on the Wall!” Luo Tian smiled, sitting cross-legged before the wall to感悟 its herbs and formulas.

As his consciousness touched the Wall, he felt himself in another realm. Herbs appeared constantly in his perception.

“Dragon-Form Grass… Soul-Stealing Flower…” Luo Tian immersed himself in the herb world, his already formidable knowledge expanding further. Herbs he recognized were skipped.

Time passed slowly. When Luo Tian opened his eyes again, it was midnight.

“Over three million—too few!” Luo Tian shook his head, sighing at the decline of the Ancient King Clan’s alchemy. In the Tianyuan Continent, he had once recognized a terrifying one hundred and fifty million herbs.

“Alright, let’s begin!” Luo Tian gazed at the wall, pointing his finger. His hands moved swiftly, carving herbs he knew onto the Wall.

“Buzz…” After carving the first herb, a faint light appeared beneath his feet, like fireflies.

Luo Tian smiled. He knew this light signified an herb not recorded on the Wall.

As the light glowed, the herb’s name vanished into the wall, out of his sight.

“Need to speed up!” Luo Tian smiled, his hands moving faster. Golden light flew from his fingers, imprinting herb names onto the wall.

Time passed slowly. The number of herbs carved grew, and the light beneath him accumulated, rising toward the sky.

“Hundred… thousand… ten thousand…”

“Ten zhang… hundred zhang… thousand zhang…” After an hour, Luo Tian took a deep breath, gazing at the shimmering column beside him. His brows furrowed.

“Need to hurry. I don’t know how long it’ll take to craft the Severing Heaven Pills. Need to gather herbs quickly!” Luo Tian murmured, no longer using one hand but both. Golden light flew from his hands, imprinting herbs onto the wall.

The column beside him grew rapidly, rising visibly.

“Thirty million!” Soon after, Luo Tian reached Fu Tianqing’s record.

As he carved the thirty-millionth herb onto the Wall, a column of light erupted, striking black skies. A deep drumbeat echoed beneath the dark sky.

“Boom…” The heavy drumbeat awakened the night, shaking Xingyue Divine City. People looked toward the Alchemy Hall.

“Alchemy Hall—someone is carving herbs! Has the old Divine Emperor found another herb classic?” People watched the rising column, murmuring.

“Haha, thanks to Fu Elder. We’ve learned thirty million more herbs!” Five Alchemy Hall elders stood in their homes, laughing aloud, gazing at the Wall.

“How? It’s formed the Moon Drum!” Fu Tianqing’s face bore disbelief, his eyes filled with confusion as he gazed at the Wall. He appeared outside it, seeing Luo Tian still carving.

“It’s him! How did he know so many herbs!” Fu Tianqing had guessed it was this youth. Today, the Alchemy Hall had only two visitors: the alchemical genius Xiao Ding and this overlooked youth.

“Is it Grandpa?” Fu Xingxuan stood in her palace, smiling.

“Hmph. How could Xiao Ding surpass Grandpa! His herb knowledge alone leaves him far behind!” Fu Xingxuan didn’t know why she thought of the alchemist who had surpassed her—Xiao Ding.

“Still continuing!” Fu Tianqing stood outside the Wall, not disturbing Luo Tian. He wanted to see how many herbs this youth could carve.

Luo Tian felt Fu Tianqing’s arrival but sneered inwardly: “Old fool, let me shock you thoroughly!”

Golden light never ceased. Another column rose beneath Luo Tian, its ascent growing faster.

“Ten thousand… twenty thousand… thirty thousand…” Fu Tianqing’s eyes widened, counting herbs with intense shock—more than when he’d seen Luo Tian craft a Sage-Level Middle-Grade Pill.

“Boom…” The green drumbeat formed again, echoing over the Wall. It spread across Xingyue Divine City.

“What’s going on? One drumbeat means thirty thousand herbs. Two mean sixty thousand! I remember Fu Elder’s record was thirty thousand. Has Fu Elder found another great achievement?” The five elders finally couldn’t sit still, rising to head toward the Wall.

“Old Divine Emperor truly is the top alchemist in the city!” Xingyue Divine City buzzed with excitement. They naturally knew what the second drumbeat meant.

“Is he a monster!” Fu Tianqing stared at Luo Tian still carving, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“Boom…” An hour later, the third column rose over Xingyue Divine City. The heavy drumbeat echoed in people’s ears.

With this third drumbeat, the city erupted. People gazed at the Wall with fervor, shouting Fu Tianqing’s name.

This third drumbeat struck Fu Tianqing’s heart like a hammer, making his breath quicken.

“Ninety thousand!” Fu Tianqing stared at Luo Tian, waiting for him to continue. He wanted to know this youth’s limit.

“Enough. When Fu Elder achieved thirty thousand, he was given a Sage Herb. I’ve three times that—should at least get three Sage Herbs!” Luo Tian muttered, stopping carving. He felt Fu Tianqing’s gaze had changed.

Three columns of golden light stood beside Luo Tian, piercing the sky like bridges to heaven.

“Should I imprint my name?” A wave of thoughts echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Wang Ding!” He quickly carved a name into the wall.

“Wang Ding, who carved ninety thousand herbs. Award: one drop of Immortal Herb Liquid, two Sage Herbs! One hundred thousand merits!” A solemn voice echoed across Xingyue Divine City.

“Buzz…” The buzzing sound spread through the columns. Vitality flooded Luo Tian’s mind.

“Immortal Herb Liquid!” Luo Tian’s heart leaped. With this drop and two Sage Herbs, his chances improved.

“Boom…” The golden column shattered. Two green herbs appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, bathed in gold light.

Even more exciting was the single drop of milky liquid—exuding Immortal Herb properties. Luo Tian’s heart surged with joy.

Without hesitation, he collected the three treasures, exhaling deeply: “Finally done!”

As the solemn voice echoed, Xingyue Divine City paused briefly before erupting in chatter.

“Not Fu Elder! Who is Wang Ding? Why have I never heard of him!” People exclaimed.

“Not Fu Elder!” The five elders entered the Wall’s range, witnessing Luo Tian collecting herbs. They saw Fu Tianqing staring in disbelief.

Chapter 1303: Cornered

In the Alchemy Hall, Luo Tian stood with joy. Six elders stared at him from a hundred zhang away.

Fu Tianqing hadn’t expected Luo Tian to know so many herbs. The other five elders hadn’t anticipated the herb-carver was a stranger.

“What’s happening these days? First Xiao Ding, now Wang Ding. Are young people rising?” One elder spoke, his voice aged.

“Wang Ding! Who is he!” Fu Xingxuan stood in her residence, puzzled. She flew toward the Alchemy Hall, disbelieving anyone could surpass her.

“First Xiao Ding, then Wang Ding. Are they connected!” Fu Xingxuan pondered, wanting to know this Wang Ding’s identity. Two consecutive defeats filled her with resentment.

“Master, I’ll return now,” Luo Tian approached Fu Tianqing respectfully.

“Do you have a master?” Fu Tianqing asked, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were a rare treasure. Mastering so many herbs—polish him slightly, and his alchemical skills would be the eighth Sage-Level Alchemist in Xingyue Divine City.

“No yet,” Luo Tian replied quickly, his mind stirring.

“Haha! Will you be my disciple?” One elder heard Luo Tian’s words and rushed to him.

“Get lost, kid. We’re destined! I’ve searched for years for a disciple like you!” Another elder scolded the first, then smiled gently at Luo Tian.

“Don’t be shameless! He’s my disciple!” Before they could continue, another elder spoke abruptly.

“My… my…” Five elders quarreled before Luo Tian, their faces red and necks swollen.

“Enough. He was my first choice—none of you!” Fu Tianqing sneered, waving his hand. A storm of Epoch Power swept the five quarreling elders away.

“Fu Elder, you…” The five elders started to speak but vanished instantly.

“Will you be my disciple?” Fu Tianqing’s eyes gleamed, scrutinizing Luo Tian carefully.

“Doubting me now!” Luo Tian mused. Seeing Fu Tianqing’s scrutinizing gaze, he bowed respectfully.

“Disciple willing!” Luo Tian quickly knelt, bowing to Fu Tianqing with excitement.

“Who is Xiao Ding?” Fu Tianqing asked, his voice authoritative. He didn’t rush to accept Luo Tian.

“Xiao Ding… he’s like a half-teacher. All my herb knowledge comes from him! However, I once asked to be his disciple, and he said he couldn’t teach me!” Luo Tian pondered briefly, bowing respectfully.

“Hm.” Fu Tianqing mused then spoke again: “Kneel three times. From now on, you are my second disciple!”

“Second disciple? I have an elder brother?” Luo Tian was puzzled but didn’t delay. He knelt and bowed three times.

“Good, good, good!” Fu Tianqing lifted Luo Tian, feeling their relationship had grown closer. His eyes glowed with joy.

“Master, these herbs I obtained just now—give them to you!” Luo Tian smiled slyly, handing Fu Tianqing the two Sage Herbs and the drop of Immortal Herb Liquid.

“Haha, you’re mocking me!” Fu Tianqing didn’t take them. He took out a storage bag and tossed it to Luo Tian.

“Keep these. It’s a拜师 gift!” Fu Tianqing chuckled, addressing Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was delighted. He took the bag, probed it with his consciousness, and his eyes lit up: “Complete!”

The storage bag contained mostly common herbs but had two Sage Herbs, thrilling Luo Tian. He inwardly marveled at Fu Tianqing’s kindness toward his newly accepted disciple.

“Use the common herbs freely, but don’t touch the high-grade herbs and Sage Herbs yet. Wait until you truly engage in alchemy to try crafting them!” Fu Tianqing instructed.

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian bowed again, gratitude in his eyes. He then asked: “Master, I’m your second disciple. Who is your first? Do I have an elder brother?”

“Me!” As Luo Tian’s words finished, a cold voice echoed. Fu Xingxuan descended like a celestial maiden from the heavens, landing before Luo Tian. Her purple eyes scrutinized him.

“Sister… Senior Sister…” Luo Tian stared at Fu Xingxuan, speechless, his face stunned.

“Where’s Xiao Ding?” Fu Xingxuan heard every word between Fu Tianqing and Luo Tian. She hadn’t expected Xiao Ding to teach someone who could surpass her.

“Senior Sister, I truly don’t know where Xiao Ding is!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, inwardly sighing his future would be tough.

“Hmph!” Fu Xingxuan sneered. For some reason, seeing Luo Tian reminded her of that Xiao Ding—annoying.

“Grandpa, expel him from the sect!” Fu Xingxuan turned, acting like a different person. She approached Fu Tianqing, playing the role of a娇 girl, stunning Luo Tian.

“Such a demon!” Luo Tian inwardly sighed. Fu Xingxuan was an exquisite beauty—no man could resist her. Luo Tian, despite his strong will, was always stunned by her beauty, losing himself.

“Why do so many admirers exist? I’m still like this. Imagine what others would feel!” Luo Tian mused, feeling if people knew he was Fu Xingxuan’s younger brother, they’d surely envy those admirers.

“Xingxuan, stop fooling around. The Alchemy Hall is declining. This kid is a promising talent!” Fu Tianqing sighed deeply.
