Luo Tian took a deep breath and glanced at Li Xiu Ran, his eyes filled with mockery: "Next is you!"

"Ah! You can't kill me, my father is the head of the Li family. If you kill me, the Li family will never forgive you!"

"By now, do you still think I fear your Li family's retaliation?" Luo Tian said with a playful smile as he watched Li Xiu Ran.

"I made a mistake, you're too magnanimous to hold grudges. Please spare me! I'll repay your kindness!" Li Xiu Ran, realizing the danger, pleaded.

"How will you repay me? Speak up. If your plan impresses me, I might grant you a path to survival!" Luo Tian flashed what he believed was an amiable smile, but it made Li Xiu Ran tremble.

As Luo Tian's smile met his eyes, Li Xiu Ran felt as if a demon were smiling at him. He trembled silently, unable to utter a word.

"Fine, I'll let you go this time! But it's not for any reason—it's to deliver a message to your dead father. Tell him Luo Tian will come for you soon!" Before Li Xiu Ran could respond, Luo Tian spoke with a show of magnanimity.

"Yes, yes!" Li Xiu Ran longed to flee immediately. Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, he quickly turned and left.

"By the way!" As Li Xiu Ran just turned around, Luo Tian's cold voice echoed.

"Ah?" Li Xiu Ran, who had just felt relieved, heard Luo Tian's voice and turned back instantly, fearing he'd changed his mind. His legs shook, and he fell to his knees, a yellow liquid trickling down his pants.

"Don't let me see you again! You've stolen men and women, if I catch you again, you'll share the same fate as your fat attendant! Go!" Luo Tian waved his hand dismissively.

"Yes, yes! I'm leaving now, leaving now!" Li Xiu Ran trembled as he looked at Luo Tian before fleeing. His speed surprised even Luo Tian.

After sensing Li Xiu Ran had left, Luo Tian's legs weakened, his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed.

Gu Qianxue opened her eyes. After regaining her energy with the elixir, she gazed at Li Yuande and Luo Tian lying on the ground, her eyes filled with shock.

Though she had divided part of her spiritual awareness to observe outside while regaining energy, when she heard Li Yuande's arrival, she had already felt despair. Gu Qianxue never expected Luo Tian to have defeated Li Yuande.

Looking at the chaos around her, Gu Qianxue was still awestruck by Luo Tian's martial arts.

When her gaze fell on Li Yuande's corpse, Gu Qianxue's eyes narrowed. She sighed inwardly—this city would surely change hands. She knew Li Yuande's status within the Li family, and if Li Jiahu could still hold back, it would be strange.

Gu Qianxue glanced at the surrounding guards, her eyes flashing coldly. She decisively shattered their dantian and erased their cultivation. If she didn't, they would surely join the Li family's retaliation later.

She sighed lightly, her gaze complex as she looked at Luo Tian lying unconscious on the ground. She took a recovery elixir and placed it in his mouth.

After taking the elixir, Luo Tian's complexion improved slightly but he still showed no sign of waking. Gu Qianxue bit her lip, hesitating before lifting Luo Tian onto her back.

Never having been so close to a man before, Gu Qianxue's face turned red. But fearing the Li family would retaliate if she delayed, she forced herself to carry Luo Tian back to the Gu family.

After placing Luo Tian on his bed, Gu Qianxue was drenched in sweat. She sighed and headed toward her father's courtyard. After all, with Li Yuande dead, she didn't know what疯狂 retaliation the Li family would unleash. She needed to inform her father early so the Gu family could prepare.

The next morning, Luo Tian stretched lazily, yawned, and felt more at ease than ever. Remembering yesterday's events, he was invigorated. As for how he had returned, he guessed the answer—only Gu Qianxue had remained unscathed.

He stopped thinking and began his first alchemy session. Previously, Luo Tian had only studied the theory but couldn't practice it—alchemy wasn't something ordinary people could afford. It required massive resources.

His first alchemy session was both nervous and excited, but the results were disappointing. Luo Tian exploded three cauldrons in a row without success.

"Why? I followed the steps exactly," Luo Tian frowned, recovering his energy while pondering.

After regaining his energy, Luo Tian entered a frenzied alchemy mode. He didn't leave his courtyard for seven days, exploding countless cauldrons and wasting numerous herbs without success. The only consolation was that his cultivation had improved significantly, even his spiritual awareness had grown.

That morning, Luo Tian stared at the cauldron with a serious expression. This was his last batch of herbs. If he failed again, he'd have to temporarily halt his alchemy plan. Continuing would likely make Gu Yun want to kill him.

Luo Tian steadied his mind, took a deep breath, and skillfully placed the main herbs into the cauldron. He pressed his palm against the fire mouth, and flames formed, entering the cauldron.

He recalled the elixir formula from the Epoch Book, and the spiritual herbs trembled slightly. A Star Grass flew into the cauldron.

After a while, the essence of Star Grass was extracted, followed by Purple Yuan Grass and凝血枝 (Blood-Clotting Branch), each extracted in turn.

The flames in the cauldron illuminated Luo Tian's serious face, and he watched intently as the fire roared within. His face was slightly pale.

The herbs in the cauldron gradually melted into medicinal essence, gathering together and emitting a faint fragrance.

Luo Tian carefully controlled the fire's intensity. When he felt the timing was right, he roared: "Condense!"

A dull sound echoed. The cauldron's lid flew into the air, releasing a faint fragrance.

Luo Tian leaned down to look inside and found several red elixirs lying within.

"Success! Finally!" Luo Tian's heart surged with joy, opening a jade bottle to store the elixirs.

The elixir Luo Tian had crafted was called "One Qi Body-Building Elixir." Though it was a first-tier elixir, its potency far exceeded ordinary body-building elixirs. Luo Tian attributed his seven days of failure to the elixir's uniqueness, unaware that others had taken months to fail at basic elixirs.

If Luo Tian's thoughts were known, he'd be surprised.

Gazing at the fruits of his month-long labor, Luo Tian's excitement lingered. It felt as if a new door had opened before him.

"With this elixir, my strength can finally rise again!"

Chapter Ten: Dragon Tiger Qi ()

Luo Tian swallowed all the elixirs at once, then began circulating his energy to fully refine the medicinal power.

The One Qi Body-Building Elixir was far more potent than ordinary body-building elixirs. As soon as it entered his mouth, it transformed into medicinal power, surging uncontrollably throughout his body.

Luo Tian was startled—this One Qi Body-Building Elixir was so fierce, one misstep could result in his body exploding.

Fortunately, the Five Elements Transformation Technique was incredibly profound, allowing it to refine elixirs far faster than ordinary techniques. Soon, the medicinal power transformed into pure energy, gathering in Luo Tian's dantian.

This enhancement took two days. When Luo Tian opened his eyes, his cultivation had reached the peak of Body-Building Stage Three.

"I've killed Li Yuande; the Li family will surely retaliate. With my current strength, even with the Five Elements Mutual Generation martial arts as a secret weapon, I can't match Li Jiahu. I must break through to Body-Building Stage Four to threaten Li Jiahu!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He clenched his teeth and swallowed the Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir.

A medicinal power ten times fiercer than the One Qi Body-Building Elixir erupted, like a mountain-descending tiger rushing into Luo Tian's body. This Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir contained a trace of tiger power.

Luo Tian was startled and desperately activated the Five Elements Transformation Technique to barely stabilize this tiger power.

But before he could catch his breath, another more violent medicinal power erupted from the elixir. A faint dragon roar echoed, and this elixir contained a trace of true dragon power as well.

The Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir was a second-tier elixir, but due to the inclusion of a drop of true dragon and tiger blood, its potency rivaled third-tier elixirs. Hence the name "Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir."

However, few knew that the true Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir contained both true dragon and tiger blood.

But ordinary people couldn't even trigger the tiger power when consuming this elixir, let alone the true dragon power. Yet Luo Tian had triggered both—this was an astronomical chance, leaving him bewildered whether to be grateful or annoyed.

Since both tiger and dragon power were so fierce, even triggering one was beyond the capacity of a Body-Building Stage Three.

At this moment, both true dragon and tiger power were triggered—Luo Tian could explode at any moment.

"Am I going to die from an elixir? No! I can't die like this! If my technique can't refine it, I'll refine it with my body!" With this thought, Luo Tian ignored the trace of true dragon energy and focused solely on refining the tiger power. He left only a small part of his attention to protect his meridians and internal organs from the true dragon energy's destruction.

But Luo Tian had clearly underestimated the destructive power of this trace of true dragon energy. When the true dragon power surged through his body, he nearly fainted from pain.

If he lost consciousness, it would mean the end!

Just as Luo Tian was about to give up, the Epoch Book in his mind seemed to sense his peril and emitted a golden light.

The moment the golden light appeared, the defiant true dragon power immediately calmed down and obediently entered Luo Tian's dantian.

Luo Tian sighed in relief, marveling at the Epoch Book's miracle. Without it, he would have died twice already.

While Luo Tian was refining the Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir, Li Jiahu's face was dark as he listened to Li Xiu Ran recounting the fight between Luo Tian and Li Yuande.

When he heard that Luo Tian had killed Li Yuande in one move, Li Jiahu spat blood and roared: "Yuande! I've only been in seclusion for a few days, yet we're already separated by the afterlife. I'll make the entire Gu family pay for your death!"

In a rage, Li Jiahu immediately gathered his clan and marched toward the Gu family.

Over these days, Gu Yun had also felt uneasy. On one hand, he was shocked by Luo Tian's rapid cultivation growth; on the other, he awaited the Li family's retaliation. However, the Li family had remained inactive for days, deepening Gu Yun's unease.

Today, Gu Yun sat in his study with a furrowed brow, deep in thought. Suddenly, his eyes brightened: "They've come?"

He set down his tea cup and walked toward the Gu family's front gate.

...

Seeing his old enemy Li Jiahu leading his clan with a fierce presence at the Gu family's gate, Gu Yun called out: "Li Jiahu, with this formation, are you trying to start a war with the Gu family?"

"Gu Yun, stop talking nonsense. My brother Li Yuande was killed by Luo Tian. I demand you hand over that boy, or there will be no peace!" Li Jiahu roared with fury.

"Li Jiahu, I won't hand him over. But I can offer some compensation!" Gu Yun replied loudly.

"It seems you're determined to protect that boy. Then prepare for war!" Li Jiahu's face darkened, surprised by Gu Yun's direct refusal.

"If you want to fight, then fight! The Gu family is ready!" Gu Yun replied loudly, his aura matching Li Jiahu's.

Seeing no resolution, Li Jiahu's energy flowed smoothly. He kicked the ground and transformed into a blur, instantly appearing before Gu Yun. His golden fist smashed down fiercely.

Gu Yun had long dealt with Li Jiahu. Seeing the blur, he had already prepared his martial arts. A massive red hand appeared and met Li Jiahu's golden fist.

"Boom..." The explosion echoed, shaking the ears of both sides' disciples and forcing them back a few steps.

Li Jiahu, like a madman, attacked Gu Yun relentlessly. The two fought for half an hour.

Suddenly, Li Jiahu retreated to his original position and sneered at Gu Yun: "Li family disciples, form the Golden Metal Luo Yuan Array!"

Hearing Li Jiahu's words, the Li family disciples immediately acted. Golden light flashed beneath their feet, quickly gathering into a golden barrier that surrounded the Gu family.

From afar, it looked like a large bowl covering the entire Gu family courtyard.

The Gu family disciples fought desperately to break free but were all repelled.

Li Jiahu watched, coldly laughing: "Gu Yun, you should have felt my breakthrough already. I'll give you a month. If you don't hand over that boy, wait for my breakthrough to destroy the Gu family!"

Chapter Eleven: Gu Yun's Decision ()

The Golden Metal Luo Yuan Array was a third-tier formation, the strongest Li family could deploy. It was a gold-element formation with weak attack but capable of trapping people and isolating them from external energy.

Body-Building stage warriors relied most on energy. Without it, they were just strong ordinary people.

Seeing the Golden Metal Luo Yuan Array, Gu Yun's face darkened. If trapped long-term, the Gu family would be helpless.

Gu Yun could temporarily reach Body-Building Stage Six with elixirs, breaking through the formation. But it would be a huge cost. Even if he broke through, he'd be weak and vulnerable. Li Jiahu would surely seize the opportunity to destroy the Gu family.

Seeing Li Jiahu's back, Gu Yun's face was dark. He ordered those behind: "Gather all family members to the council hall!"

While the Gu family struggled with the Golden Metal Luo Yuan Array, Luo Tian remained unaware, still focused on refining the Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir.

...

In the Gu family council hall, Gu Yun sat on the main seat. Important elders were seated on both sides. The atmosphere was tense, with everyone frowning.

"Master, it's almost half a month now. Maybe we should hand over the boy," Gu Qianxue's third elder suggested cautiously.

"No!" Gu Yun coldly glanced at the third elder but saw others remained silent, not opposing the elder's suggestion.

"Third Grandfather, if we hand over the boy whenever Li family demands, what prestige does our Gu family have?" Gu Qianxue's voice rang out.

Though young, none dared to underestimate her. Gu Qianxue had reached Body-Building Stage Four and was stronger than many elders. With dual-element energy talent, she had a promising future. Most Gu family members respected her, but this third elder was an exception.

The third elder ignored Gu Qianxue and stared at Gu Yun: "This boy doesn't even bear the Gu name. Why should we risk so much to protect him? By his talent? Remember, talent doesn't equal strength. To become a strong person, one must first ensure survival!"

The third elder's words were harsh, even implying Gu Qianxue. Gu Yun frowned but remained composed.

"Others, what suggestions do you have?" he asked the other elders.

After several elders spoke, arguments erupted. Some suggested protecting Luo Tian to preserve Gu family prestige; others advised handing him over to avoid conflict with the Li family.

Seeing arguments turn into factional disputes, Gu Yun frowned and slammed his hand on the table: "Stop arguing! I hope you all understand one thing. Our Gu family's current status wasn't gained through compromise. So I've decided to wait three more days. If no solution, I'll take the Explosive Body Elixir to break through the formation and fight Li family!"

Seeing Gu Yun's decision, the Gu family fell silent. They knew there was no turning back and began preparing.

Three days passed quickly. Some low-level Gu family disciples felt weak, clearly sensing their energy had dropped to less than a tenth.

Gu Yun stood in the courtyard with his family behind him. Three days had passed, but no solution to break through the formation. He held a brown elixir and made up his mind. Just as he was about to put it in his mouth, a tiger roar echoed, stopping him.

"A trace of tiger power!" Gu Yun looked at Luo Tian's courtyard, his face shocked. Others also turned their heads.

"Dad, what is tiger power?" Gu Lei asked confusedly.

"Did you think the Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir was given by me? Though I'm confident I could make it, adding a trace of true dragon and tiger power is beyond my ability. True dragons and tigers are top-tier beasts; I'm far from that level," Gu Yun sighed, admiring the elder who had entrusted him with the elixir. His cultivation must have reached the Tongxuan level.

"What's the difference if this Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir contains a trace of true dragon and tiger power?" Gu Lei asked again.

"Difference? Huge! Ordinary Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixirs are slightly more potent but manageable. But adding these two drops of blood, it's ten times stronger—only those with exceptional luck can survive. If you took it, you'd explode within a breath!" Gu Yun sighed.

Hearing Gu Yun's explanation, Gu Lei shivered and secretly thanked that he had lost to Luo Tian. If he had won, he couldn't imagine the consequences.

Gu Yun hadn't expected this Dragon Tiger Body-Building Elixir to contain a trace of true dragon and tiger power. If he had known, he wouldn't have let Luo Tian take it now. He also hadn't expected Luo Tian to withstand such power.

Gu Yun was right—without the Epoch Book, Luo Tian would already be dead.

Though Luo Tian had withstood the power with the Epoch Book, he couldn't refine it quickly.

Luo Tian had no choice but to compress most of the power into his body, waiting to refine it later.

The Five Elements Transformation Technique activated as Luo Tian absorbed the Gu family's energy. He didn't know that the Gu family, trapped by the formation, had almost no energy left. After his absorption, there was none remaining.

Feeling the Gu family's energy depletion, elders who had previously supported handing over Luo Tian became restless and demanded Gu Yun act quickly. But he silenced them all.

Gu Yun didn't rush to take the elixir but told everyone to wait patiently. The Gu family wouldn't fall, for he knew Luo Tian's breakthrough would bring an unimaginable enhancement. Perhaps even surpassing himself.

Then, Gu Yun wouldn't fear Li Jiahu anymore.

After absorbing the energy, Luo Tian felt the Gu family's thinness but had no choice. After all, breakthrough was imminent; missing this chance would mean waiting for years.

Finally, after absorbing the Gu family's remaining energy, Luo Tian's dantian felt like a full jar of water. The final drop pushed against the dantian barrier.

Luo Tian endured the pain in his meridians, roaring: "Body-Building Stage Four! Break through, break through, break through!"

Chapter Twelve: Five Elements Cycle Seal ()

With the sound of dragon roars and tiger cries, Luo Tian's meridians expanded several times. His internal energy suddenly became abundant.

"Success!" Luo Tian's heart surged with joy. He swung his arm, feeling stronger than Body-Building Stage Three by countless times. If he faced Li Yuande now, his body refined by the true dragon would easily defeat him.

Breaking into Body-Building Stage Four, Luo Tian's spiritual awareness also increased significantly. It had spread hundreds of meters. He decided to contact the Epoch Book again with his spiritual awareness, seeing what changes would occur.

"Boom!" Spiritual awareness surged like waves toward the Epoch Book. As it opened the third page, Luo Tian felt as if he had entered another world. He quickly saw a figure standing on a mountain peak, hands changing constantly. A massive seal formed from the figure's hands. The figure pushed forward, and the seal disappeared from his hands, appearing on a mountain peak moments later. The massive seal smashed down.

"Boom..."

A shocking scene appeared—the mountain shattered before the seal even touched it. The seal followed, as if to pierce through the ground, forming a dark hole.

"Five Elements Cycle Seal!" The words appeared in Luo Tian's mind, followed by countless images flooding his thoughts.

Gu Yun watched Luo Tian still meditating and personally stood in front of him to guard.

Seeing the family head guarding that boy, some Gu family members who had been discontent sneered and became even more upset. But under Gu Yun's authority, they didn't dare speak.

Not long after, Luo Tian opened his eyes. A wave of energy spread from his hands, forming a golden seal. The ancient patterns on it carried an aged aura.

"What is this martial art? Even the energy waves are enough to make me feel trembling! It's almost impossible to resist!" The third elder looked terrified, stepping back several steps to steady himself.

Luo Tian's eyes glowed with joy—his first attempt had succeeded. He glanced at the formation above and pushed his hands upward.

"Boom!"

The seal vanished instantly, followed by a strong collision sound that made everyone's ears ring.

"Crack!"

A clear sound echoed, and the formation shattered at an observable speed.

The Gu family's people showed joy as they felt energy seeping through the cracks into their home. They believed it would fully break within a quarter of an hour.

"Good boy!" Gu Yun laughed and patted Luo Tian's shoulder, his eyes filled with relief. These days had been tough for Gu Yun, who had endured family pressure to protect Luo Tian. For him, it was a torment. But Luo Tian hadn't disappointed him.

Gu Qianxue watched Luo Tian, her eyes complex. Seeing the mysterious martial art he had displayed, she wondered about his true identity.

Feeling the long-lost energy, some elders who had wanted to hand over Luo Tian felt ashamed and lowered their heads. With the power Luo Tian had just shown, even Gu Yun might not be his match. In such a short time, this genius would be cherished by any family.

Not even allowing Luo Tian to catch his breath, Gu Yun led him to the council hall and told him about Li family's visit.

Luo Tian sat on a chair, listened to Gu Yun's words, and his face darkened: "It's time for the Li family a visit!"

...

Tianyuan City had long been controlled by three major families: Li, Gu, and Wang. Peace had prevailed until now. Today, however, the city was unusually quiet. The once bustling city had all doors closed.

People noticed that Gu family members, who hadn't gone out for a long time, had now come out. The leader was Gu Yun, followed by Gu Qianxue and some elders. Seeing this, everyone knew something big was about to happen in Tianyuan City.

As Gu Yun's group approached the Li family, Li Jiahu was deep in meditation within the ancestral hall.

Li Jiahu's eyes were closed, his expression calm. His aura changed constantly. Soon, a clear sound echoed from his body. His powerful aura formed around him, growing stronger and stronger!

After a while, Li Jiahu suddenly opened his eyes, filled with joy. He laughed loudly: "Hmph! Body-Building Stage Six! Today is the day your family will be destroyed!"

At the same time, Gu Yun's group had arrived at the Li family's gate. They shouted loudly: "Li Jiahu! Come out and face me!"

The Gu family's people, who had been trapped by the formation earlier, were all holding their breath. They growled lowly, forming a fierce battle spirit that rose into the sky.

The Li family's gate guards saw this formation and were so scared their legs trembled, fleeing inside.

Li Xiu Ran had been in a good mood recently. All Gu family members, including that demon Luo Tian, were trapped inside. He no longer had to worry about meeting the demon. And when his father emerged from seclusion, he would destroy the Gu family. Then he wouldn't let Luo Tian escape either. Perhaps he'd even capture Gu Qianxue to play with.

Seeing the guards who often flattered him fleeing in panic, Li Xiu Ran frowned: "What's wrong? Hurry up! You don't know how to stay calm?"

"Master, it's bad news. The Gu family has come!" The guard panted and said.

"Rubbish! The Gu family is trapped in the formation, how can they come out? I'll break your legs if you lie again!" Li Xiu Ran slapped the guard, showing he wouldn't be deceived.

"Yes... yes..." The guard quickly explained.

"Boom!" Before Chen Er finished speaking, a dull sound echoed.

"Hmph! Who dares to come into my Li family? Take me to see!" Li Xiu Ran, showing his authority, patted Chen Er's shoulder.

"Li Jiahu! If you don't come out, I'll tear down your Li family!" Gu Yun's loud voice echoed throughout the entire Li family!

Li Xiu Ran, who had previously shown authority, heard Gu Yun's voice and staggered. If it weren't for Chen Er supporting him, he would have fallen to the ground.

"Damn! They really came!" Li Xiu Ran cursed, then ran toward the ancestral hall.

Li Xiu Ran rushed all the way to the Li family's ancestral hall and shouted: "Father, father! Bad news!"

Li Jiahu, who had just broken through and was in a good mood, heard Li Xiu Ran's loud call. He ran to his father's side and slapped him: "How did I teach you? You should stay calm! If I had been in the middle of breaking through, your shout would have made me lose control!"

Li Xiu Ran knew he had been reckless and lowered his head, muttering: "It's really your father; you talk to me like that!"

Li Jiahu coldly nodded and walked toward the Li family's gate.

At the Li family's gate, two families were already facing off. Seeing Li Jiahu step out of the door, everyone's eyes turned to him.

Li Jiahu saw Gu Yun and coldly snorted: "Gu Yun, I didn't expect you to come here yourself. Since you're here, don't go back!"

Chapter Thirteen: Li Family's Demise ()

As the war between Gu and Li families was about to ignite, a gentle voice suddenly echoed: "Today is so lively!"

"Hmph! I didn't expect you to bring the Wang family too. Gu Yun, this is your support? Wang Pengtian, are you also getting involved in this mess?" Hearing the voice, Li Jiahu's face darkened.

"Wang Pengtian, I know your situation. I'm sure today if the Gu family loses, it'll be your turn!" Wang Pengtian wore a scholar's robe and walked toward Gu Yun.

"Since you've come, let the two families deal with it together!" Li Jiahu nodded nonchalantly. His aura burst out, and his Body-Building Stage Six power surged toward Gu Yun and Wang Pengtian.

"Body-Building Stage Six! I didn't expect you to break through!" Gu Yun and Wang Pengtian looked at Li Jiahu's Body-Building Stage Six with grim faces.

"Hmph! It's too late to regret now!" The three were contemporaries, and now the other two were under Li Jiahu's control. He was in a good mood.

After speaking, Li Jiahu turned his gaze to Luo Tian: "You're Luo Tian? You do have some strength. That's why you dared to come here and provoke us! After I finish these two old men, I'll make you wish for death!"

Li Jiahu spoke and immediately attacked Gu Yun and Wang Pengtian, clearly not taking Luo Tian seriously.

Seeing Li Jiahu attack him, Gu Yun and Wang Pengtian's faces darkened. They knew today was complicated.

Gu Yun held a pill and swallowed it, his aura suddenly surging to Body-Building Stage Six.

Wang Pengtian also bit his finger, spilling a drop of blood onto a talisman. After absorbing the blood, the talisman came alive, forming a golden monkey's figure.

Wang Pengtian didn't throw the talisman but pressed it against his chest. Soon, the monkey's image merged with Wang Pengtian, and his aura surged to Body-Building Stage Six.

"Kill!" After enhancing their strength, the two attacked Li Jiahu.

"Kill!" Seeing their family head charge first, the three families' disciples all roared and fought fiercely.

Gu Qianxue activated her Great Sun Palm, rushing toward a Li family Body-Building Stage Four elder. Gu Lei also howled and rushed toward Li Xiu Ran.

"Explosive Body Elixir, Golden Metal Body Protection Talisman!" Li Jiahu saw the two fighting desperately and sneered.

"Did you think these things could match me? Today I'll show you the difference between entering Body-Building Stage Six with external means and true Body-Building Stage Six!" Li Jiahu attacked fiercely, and the three quickly fought together.

Luo Tian watched the four fighting and saw that even after Gu Yun and Wang Pengtian used special means to reach Body-Building Stage Six, they couldn't defeat Li Jiahu. His eyes were serious—Luo Tian knew the real battle was between these three.

Thinking this, Luo Tian also took out an Explosive Body Elixir. After swallowing it, he felt a strong medicinal power flow into his dantian. He couldn't help but roar and attack Li Jiahu fiercely.

With Luo Tian's addition, the three combined their strength to temporarily suppress Li Jiahu. However, they felt no relief but more pressure. They knew their current state was due to special means; once time passed, they would be like meat on a chopping block.

Li Jiahu also understood this and only defended without attacking, creating a stalemate.

"This won't work! I need to try that move—just gamble!" Luo Tian thought and shouted at Gu Yun: "Master, hold on a bit!"

Luo Tian didn't wait for their approval and jumped out. His hands formed waves, and a series of vibrations gradually formed from his hands.

Luo Tian channeled his five elements energy to its peak, quickly gathering it into his hands. A terrifying pressure from the forming seal spread out.

Under this terrifying pressure, low-level disciples of the three families stopped fighting and looked at Luo Tian's forming seal with fear.

Luo Tian was also drenched in sweat, his energy feeling drained. He had thought that after reaching Body-Building Stage Four, his energy would double, but he underestimated the Cycle Seal. Though he had used it before in the Gu family, this time he was using an enhanced version with Five Elements Mutual Generation. The consumption was terrifying.

"Haha! Boy, you're out of energy, aren't you?" Seeing Luo Tian's state, Li Jiahu laughed. Though he felt the seal's terror, he could also sense Luo Tian's energy was running out and couldn't sustain the seal.

Luo Tian's eyes turned red, his expression showing strong resentment. He knew in this situation, he might be drained to death.

Just as Luo Tian was about to give up, the last page of the Epoch Book secretly opened a crack. A streak of crimson energy flowed out from the book.

Luo Tian, who had already been desperate, was surprised to find this new force. As the red energy joined in, the seal finally formed.

Luo Tian roared: "Five Elements Cycle Seal, First Seal—King's Seal! Go!"
