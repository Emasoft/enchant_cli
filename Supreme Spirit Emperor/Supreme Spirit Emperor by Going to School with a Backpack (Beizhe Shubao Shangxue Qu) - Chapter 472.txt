The disciples of Dan Peak were enraged, and soon the conflict spread to other major peaks. After all, how many cultivators didn't need medicinal pills? With so few alchemists, it was natural to flatter these inner disciples of Dan Peak.

In an instant, the crowd's fury surged. Disciples from other peaks emerged from their respective mountains, gathering at the outer gate. The first target of these inner disciples was Zhu Youde, the head of the outer gate.

"Zhu Youde! Release that Dan Luo for me, or you'll regret it today!" Standing outside the head's office, disciples demanded Zhu Youde to hand over Dan Luo.

"Everyone, please listen! I'm investigating, I'm investigating..." Zhu Youde was stunned. He hadn't expected the situation to escalate so quickly. Upon receiving the news, he immediately dispatched people to search for Dan Luo. However, after thoroughly checking all registered outer disciples, they found no trace of a person named Dan Luo.

"Damn it, if I find out who you are, I'll kill you!" Zhu Youde cursed inwardly but smiled politely at the elders.

At that moment, Luo Tian and Sun Kemin were leisurely refining pills. They had no idea that merely scolding a few inner disciples of Dan Peak had caused such a massive uproar.

If they knew, Luo Tian would have admired his own foresight and changed his identity. Otherwise, a large number of people would be surrounding them now. Even if the three were strong, they wouldn't stand a chance against so many.

This was the first major uprising in Tianlong Sect for a long time. The name Dan Luo spread throughout the sect, even overshadowing Luo Tian.

However, after searching for three or four days, the inner disciples couldn't find Dan Luo. After beating Zhu Youde, they eventually calmed down.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian's face was serious. The Tianji Flame Vessel beside him radiated intense heat, and seven-colored flames danced within the cauldron. A cluster of emerald medicinal liquid hovered there, continuously condensing.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed. Black storm clouds loomed over the Tianlong Cemetery, covering it completely.

"Fourth-grade medicinal pill—Unlimited Breaking Immortal Pill!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with excitement. He carefully observed the condensation of the medicinal liquid, sweat trickling down his face.

In recent days, Luo Tian's alchemical skills had improved dramatically. He had plundered over a dozen inner disciples' storage rings, earning a fortune and finally gathering the ingredients for a fourth-grade medicinal pill.

The Unlimited Breaking Immortal Pill was far superior to the ordinary Breaking Immortal Pill. It could grant a six in ten chance of advancing from Heavenly Immortal Initial to Heavenly Immortal Full. More importantly, it contained an "Unlimited Power" that could refine the user's dantian. This was the most precious aspect, but it wasn't easy to succeed—more difficult than advancing to Heavenly Immortal Initial.

"Open..." After an hour, Luo Tian slapped the cauldron's lid. Golden divine light surged upward from the Tianji Flame Vessel, and a golden vortex emerged from the cauldron, with a single medicinal pill at its center.

"Crack..." A bolt of golden lightning descended but twisted within the vortex, as if absorbed by it. It vanished silently from Luo Tian's sight.

"Is that all?" Luo Tian's lips twitched as he watched the formidable immortal lightning, seemingly devoured by the pill.

"Crack..." Before Luo Tian could recover from his astonishment, another black lightning bolt descended. The overwhelming aura made even Luo Tian feel threatened.

Yet, as if naturally repelled, the black lightning didn't stir any chaos. It was directly absorbed by the vortex. However, the golden vortex turned into a striking gold-black hue.

Thunderous roars echoed as two more lightning bolts fell, absorbed by the golden vortex. The black storm clouds completely dissipated.

"Buzz..." The golden medicinal pill emitted a continuous hum. The vortex suddenly contracted, being absorbed into the pill.

"Come..." Luo Tian extended his hand, his powerful spiritual awareness enveloping the pill and bringing it into his grasp.

"Excellent!" Luo Tian nodded, observing the black patterns on the pill—resembling a Taijitu.

Chapter 1827: Discovery

"With this pill, our advancement to Heavenly Immortal Intermediate is certain!" Sun Kemin drooled, gazing at the Unlimited Breaking Immortal Pill in Luo Tian's hand.

"Alchemy—I once dabbled in it back in our world, but I admit I'm no match for Luo Xian's understanding of alchemy," Yu Changtian said, admiration in his eyes as he looked at Luo Tian. He had once been a conqueror of the world, but in the Immortal Realm, he'd suffered repeated setbacks. If not for Luo Tian's encouragement, he might have succumbed to despair as rumors suggested.

"Enough. Let's refine three more batches and give each of you one," Luo Tian said softly, also giving Gu Qianxue a pill.

Thunderous roars echoed until nightfall. After distributing one pill to Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian, the three resumed their cultivation of ghost qi.

At midnight, Luo Tian slowly removed the golden seal from his head. His face was filled with joy as he gazed at the black, ink-like Ghost-Controlling Seal hovering above him.

"Mid-level. Time to reap a harvest!" Luo Tian murmured, and Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian also opened their eyes.

"Buzz..." A black shadow appeared outside the hut, gazing at Luo Tian's dwelling. As usual, it was wrapped in black qi, moving toward the depths of the Tianlong Cemetery.

But as Gu Qianxue took her first step, a streak of light shot out from the hut toward her.

"Hmm?" Gu Qianxue's gaze sharpened. She caught the streak with her hand, revealing a jade bottle in her palm.

"What is this?" Gu Qianxue frowned. Her expressionless eyes flickered slightly, sensing the intense herbal energy within.

"Fourth-grade medicinal pill!" Gu Qianxue whispered. She recognized the pill immediately—this was a true immortal breakthrough pill.

Gu Qianxue's eyes changed, but threads of black qi spread from her body. An invisible killing intent also凝聚 in her eyes.

"This is the second time you've disturbed my cultivation path!" Gu Qianxue spoke solemnly. Her killing intent faded, but her mind was puzzled. According to logic, she should be emotionless. Why did this youth's actions unsettle her cultivation path?

"I can't let him live. Once I retrieve the item from the cemetery, I'll kill him!" Gu Qianxue thought, stepping back into the endless ghosts. Her mind had already made a decision.

"What is he after?" Luo Tian's eyes showed pain. He could feel Gu Qianxue's genuine intent to kill him.

"Don't worry, maybe she has her reasons!" Sun Kemin comforted.

"Shut up, you bachelor!" Luo Tian slapped away Sun Kemin's hand reaching for his storage ring, cursing.

"…" Yu Changtian was speechless. He hadn't expected Sun Kemin to still try to grab things at this moment.

But Yu Changtian didn't know that Sun Kemin's actions were for Luo Tian. If he had pleaded gently, Luo Tian might have become more stubborn.

Sun Kemin's actions were understood by Luo Tian, but he didn't speak out. After calming himself, he turned his gaze to the Ghost-Controlling Seal.

"From today on, all ghosts below Heavenly Immortal Intermediate in Tianlong Cemetery are mine!" Luo Tian boasted. With countless ghosts, he was certain that even a Heavenly Immortal Late would perish before him in the night.

"Yu..." Luo Tian roared, then unleashed a stream of spiritual energy from his hands, continuously infusing it into the Ghost-Controlling Seal above their heads.

Suddenly, waves of black qi erupted from the seal, filling the thatched hut. They burst out and spread in all directions.

Luo Tian bit his tongue, spitting blood onto the seal. The澎湃 black qi filled the sky.

"Roar..." Howls echoed as ghosts howled at the sky's swirling black qi, emitting wild excitement. They began to devour the black qi emanating from the seal.

"Ten... a hundred... a thousand..." Unknowable connections flooded Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian could clearly feel that after each ghost devoured the black qi, their fates were now in his hands.

"This is truly astonishing!" Luo Tian marveled at Guigu Zi's power. He was even more eager to see what would happen if he perfected the "Ghost-Controlling Seal." The entire Immortal Realm would be his to conquer.

"With this technique, I can have a chance against the Eternal Life Mountain!" Luo Tian murmured, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

Sun Kemin and Yu Changtian instinctively shivered. They also marveled at the power of Luo Tian's Ghost-Controlling Seal.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian's face remained smiling. All ghosts of Heavenly Immortal Intermediate and Initial in the Tianlong Cemetery were completely subdued by the Ghost-Controlling Seal.

"Eight thousand!" Luo Tian murmured, his face filled with excitement. Adding the dozens of Heavenly Immortal Initial ghosts he had subdued before, it totaled eight thousand—five thousand Heavenly Immortal Initial and three thousand Heavenly Immortal Intermediate. This was an abnormal number, though not comparable to the vast Tianlong Sect. But if used properly, it was enough for Luo Tian to negotiate with the Tianlong Sect.

"Smile..." Luo Tian spoke solemnly. As he finished speaking, all ghosts surrounding the thatched hut and the Tianlong Cemetery smiled with open mouths.

"What's going on?" Gu Qianxue was walking among the ghosts. She had felt the previous incident, thinking it was something changing in the cemetery's depths.

But when Gu Qianxue saw the ghosts smiling at her, she broke out in cold sweat. Imagine a midnight scene deep within the cemetery—around her were strange-shaped ghosts, all smiling at her. What kind of feeling was that? Even with Gu Qianxue's transcendent nature, she was terrified. She even felt the urge to retreat.

But the smile lasted only a moment. The ghosts quickly returned to their usual state, making Gu Qianxue think she had hallucinated.

"Truly a ghost!" Gu Qianxue rubbed her eyes, watching the ghosts return to normal. She bit her teeth and continued toward the cemetery's depths.

"You, what is in the cemetery's depths?" Luo Tian asked softly, concern in his eyes. After so many days, Gu Qianxue hadn't succeeded yet—this must be something complicated.

"It's definitely related to ghosts. Maybe it's even a ghost king!" Sun Kemin said softly. A ghost king was beyond the realm of ghosts, capable of cultivation like humans. In the middle and upper three realms, there was a sect called the Ghost King Sect, entirely composed of ghost cultivators. They also controlled a sacred mountain known as the Ghost King Mountain.

"Quickly strengthen your power and subdue all these ghosts. Then no one in the lower three realms can harm me!" Luo Tian murmured, then reapplied the seal to his head.

Time passed slowly. Gu Qianxue emerged from the cemetery's depths again, her body still battered.

"Damn it, so close..." Gu Qianxue thought. Luo Tian waited at the path.

"How's it going? Still not successful? Need help?" Luo Tian asked softly, seeing Gu Qianxue's battered appearance. His heart ached.

"No need... just do your part, let me in. Don't interfere with anything else; you can't handle it!" Gu Qianxue coldly replied.

"You don't know, your smile is really beautiful. Before, when you smiled, it was truly breathtaking!" Luo Tian watched Gu Qianxue walk past him toward the distance.

"I don't care what I was before or our connection. I am Gu Qianxue, and I like who I am now!" Gu Qianxue coldly replied. Her elegant figure disappeared from Luo Tian's sight.

"Truly... there's still a trace of Qianxue!" Luo Tian lightly shook his head, then walked out of the courtyard toward the market. He planned to deliver this last batch of pills before focusing on cultivation, waiting for the Grand Alchemy Competition.

Walking along the road, Luo Tian naturally wore his illusion mask. When he heard people talking, especially two outer disciples' conversation, it caught his attention.

"Did you hear? Dan Luo still hasn't appeared. The inner disciples of Dan Peak are almost crazy. So many people, yet no one found him," a cleaning disciple said with admiration.

"Yes, I heard. This incident even caught the attention of inner disciples' elders. Even Master Zhao Ritian knows about it. After all, the Alchemy Master has announced that whoever wins the competition one month later will be his disciple!" a young man said with admiration.

"I hope Dan Luo Master wins the competition. That would be a great honor for us outer disciples!" Their conversation made Luo Tian touch his nose and quickly change his appearance.

"Is it really that serious? He just beat a few of your disciples. Why are you so relentless!" Luo Tian thought, his face showing disdain as he strode toward the market.

The market was still bustling. People gathered in groups, but outer disciples wore worried faces. Dan Luo's disappearance meant their herbs were wasted. Now it wasn't just inner disciples searching for Luo Tian, but even outer disciples were looking for Dan Luo.

"Blame those inner disciples. If they hadn't done that, Dan Luo Master wouldn't have been afraid to come out!" an outer disciple said angrily.

Chapter 1829: A Good Blade

Under the black night, in the eerie cemetery, Luo Tian and his companions walked through the Tianlong Cemetery with serious expressions. Though the ghosts posed no real threat, the cemetery was filled with an evil aura, making them cautious.

"Should we dig up these graves to see if there are any good burial items?" Sun Kemin looked at the towering mounds, rubbing his hands. His old habit was coming back.

"Don't mess around. These graves can't be disturbed; if they are, the elders will know!" Luo Tian stopped him again. He had already warned Sun Kemin multiple times on this journey.

"Roar..." After walking for nearly an hour, they reached the cemetery's depths. The ghosts' level had risen to Heavenly Immortal Late.

Seeing Luo Tian and his companions, the Heavenly Immortal Late ghosts let out warning growls, stopping them in their tracks.

"So many Heavenly Immortal Lates!" The three were stunned by the sight of over a hundred strange-shaped ghosts before them, some already forming human shapes.

"My god, over a hundred Heavenly Immortal Lates! This is truly a terrifying force!" Sun Kemin exclaimed, his eyes wide with awe.

"Luo Tian, we must elevate the Ghost-Controlling Seal one level or quickly reach Heavenly Immortal Intermediate to subdue these ghosts. With them, no one in the lower three realms can harm me!" Sun Kemin's eyes shone with excitement, imagining a scene of countless ghosts attacking.

"Terrifying..." Luo Tian's eyes also showed awe. Though he had prepared, he was still stunned. Over a hundred Heavenly Immortal Lates could destroy a sect without any true immortal. Even a Heavenly Immortal Peak would be exhausted to death.

Even the vast Tianlong Sect had only a few Heavenly Immortal Lates, no more than one hundred. Left Qiu Ming and the eight elders were only Heavenly Immortal Lates, about to reach Heavenly Immortal Peak.

"Use spiritual energy protection. These guys probably won't bother us," Sun Kemin said softly, then surrounded himself with spiritual energy.

Luo Tian and Yu Changtian did the same. After this, Sun Kemin felt uneasy again and took out three seals to stick on their bodies.

Sure enough, after doing this, the Heavenly Immortal Lates stopped moving and let out growls but no longer viewed Luo Tian with hostility.

"Phew..." The three sighed, then continued deeper into the cemetery. But they remained cautious.

"You wife how did she do it?" As they walked, Sun Kemin asked again. After all, Gu Qianxue hadn't prepared anything before entering.

"Unknown. Maybe it's related to her changed nature," Luo Tian sighed deeply.

Time passed slowly. After walking another hour, they finally reached the cemetery's end and saw Gu Qianxue in black robes.

In their view, a massive tomb stood out from the others. Its size was dozens of times larger than regular tombs, entirely black with faint black qi seeping out.

A black ghost-headed sword hovered above the tomb, radiating an eerie aura. The fierce ghost head seemed to have slain countless lives. Even from a distance, it made Luo Tian feel cold.

Around the ghost-headed sword stood four massive creatures, as if guarding it. A silhouette stood beneath the sword, with four black threads emanating from Gu Qianxue's body and wrapping around the four massive creatures.

"Ten Thousand Immortal Peak!" The next moment, Diao Dezhu's eyes burst with shock. He felt the aura of the four massive creatures, making him feel suffocated.

But those four massive ghosts were now slightly stunned, as if controlled by Gu Qianxue.

"How did your wife manage it? She's even subdued these four big guys!" Sun Kemin looked at her in disbelief.

"That sword isn't ordinary. It must be a secret treasure; it's definitely not a low-grade immortal artifact!" Yu Changtian also looked serious, feeling the strong pressure from the ghost-headed sword.

"How come Tianlong Sect has such things!" Luo Tian frowned, deepening his thoughts. This Tianlong Cemetery felt unusually complex.

"You..." As Luo Tian was observing Gu Qianxue, she noticed their presence. Her eyes showed surprise—she hadn't expected Luo Tian and his companions to appear here.

"Roar..." But as Gu Qianxue's attention was diverted, the four massive ghosts began to struggle violently.

"Damn it!" As the four ghosts struggled, Gu Qianxue's face turned pale. She cursed softly and then fought against the four ghosts as if playing tug-of-war.

But it was too late. It seemed to have disrupted some balance, and the four ghosts' black eyes gradually glowed with eerie light. They began to struggle fiercely.

"Need help?" Luo Tian's face changed slightly. If the four ghosts broke free, they would all be crushed by them. These were Ten Thousand Immortal Peaks. Though ghosts' combat power was weaker than human Ten Thousand Immortal Peaks, one human could match three or four of the same level. But these four were beyond their ability to resist.

"Yes!" Gu Qianxue replied, her eyes filled with hostility toward Luo Tian and his companions. She had come here for the ghost-headed sword, but any movement of it would make the four ghosts attack her. She had tried many times to find a way, but now her plan was ruined by Luo Tian's arrival.

"How can I help..." Luo Tian's eyes showed anxiety as the four ghosts struggled more fiercely.

"I need ghost qi, a lot of it. If you don't have any, then all of you will be fed to the ghosts!" Gu Qianxue shouted at Luo Tian and his companions, filled with hostility. She had found a way to control the four ghosts, but Luo Tian's arrival ruined it.

But Gu Qianxue had a way out here. Luo Tian and his companions didn't.

"Okay!" Luo Tian nodded, knowing this wasn't the time to be picky. He formed a hand seal and the Ghost-Controlling Seal flew out from his body.

At the moment the seal left, it brought a powerful pressure to the four Ten Thousand Immortal Peak ghosts. It was an instinctive fear.

"What?" Gu Qianxue's eyes were also serious. She had deep knowledge of ghosts and could feel the four Ten Thousand Immortal Peak ghosts' intense fear at the sight of the seal.

"Buzz..."澎湃 ghost qi spread from the seal, then poured into Gu Qianxue's body.

"Boom..." As the powerful ghost qi rushed into her body, a strong explosion echoed. It felt like a great supplement, instantly restoring Gu Qianxue's complexion and making it rosy.

"Crackling..." The four black threads connecting Gu Qianxue and the four ghosts suddenly expanded.

"Roar..." The four Ten Thousand Immortal Peak ghosts let out a roar and stopped struggling, like statues. They stood there motionless.

"Finally done!" Gu Qianxue sighed deeply, then looked at Luo Tian and asked: "How did you get here?"

"Nothing much. I just felt a bit bored in the thatched hut, so I came out for some fresh air!" Luo Tian said, retrieving the Ghost-Controlling Seal and speaking casually. His eyes looked at the ghost-headed sword hovering above them.

"What is this thing?" Luo Tian asked in return. He felt something was off.

"A ghost artifact, a middle-grade ghost artifact!" Gu Qianxue's face changed as she looked at the ghost-headed sword.

"Haha, Luo Tian, you can't let your wife have it. This thing is mine!" As Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue were talking, Sun Kemin sneaked up to the ghost-headed sword without their notice. He didn't hesitate and grabbed the hilt of the sword.

"Stop!" Gu Qianxue's face changed immediately. She shouted at Sun Kemin, trying to stop him, but she hadn't yet untied the black threads.

"Idiot!" Luo Tian also cursed softly. At this moment, he finally remembered what was missing—that Sun Kemin himself.

"How could it be? If you marry Luo Tian, I'll give this sword to you!" Sun Kemin looked disdainful and grabbed the ghost-headed sword, holding it in his hand.

"Good sword!" Sun Kemin laughed and swung the ghost-headed sword. A dark blade's aura flew out from his hand, slicing a Ten Thousand Immortal Peak ghost. A black wound appeared instantly, making Luo Tian's face slightly change.

"Buzz..." But as Sun Kemin swung the sword, the fierce ghost head on the hilt glowed with intense light. The massive tomb also emitted a crackling sound, and wisps of gray qi flowed out from it. Luo Tian's face changed instantly.

"Haha, good sword! Good sword..." On the other hand, Sun Kemin's eyes flashed with black qi. He swung the ghost-headed sword wildly, sending dark blade auras flying in all directions.

Chapter 1830: Ghost King

"Sun Kemin!" Luo Tian roared, dodging the dark blade auras. He didn't know what Sun Kemin was doing.

"You're coming to die! This sword isn't that easy to obtain!" Gu Qianxue shouted, dodging the dark blade auras.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue spoke, the ground of the tomb slowly cracked open. A black hand emerged from the tomb, making Luo Tian and Yu Changtian's faces change slightly.

"What is this?" They both leapt into action, rushing toward Sun Kemin to subdue him first.

But Sun Kemin was unusually brave. He swung the ghost-headed sword with fierce momentum, each strike bringing immense pressure to Luo Tian and Yu Changtian.

Meanwhile, a black figure also crawled out of the tomb, appearing in Luo Tian's view. A powerful aura spread through the world, even making the four Ten Thousand Immortal Peak ghosts Gu Qianxue had briefly subdued tremble.

"True Immortal's power!" Luo Tian punched Sun Kemin back, his lips twitching. He looked at the black humanoid ghost.

"This is a Ghost King, but it hasn't fully evolved. Its power is at the threshold of True Immortal, but only one step away from reaching True Immortal. Thus, it can unleash part of True Immortal's power!" Gu Qianxue explained to Luo Tian.

"What the hell is this thing!" Luo Tian trembled. That True Immortal aura made him feel terrified.

"This sword is a suppressant for this Ghost King. You idiot friend grabbed it directly, releasing this Ghost King!" Gu Qianxue shouted loudly. She was finally worried now. A Threshold True Immortal Ghost King, she couldn't handle it. They would all die.

"An idiot teammate! When will this fool fix his habit!" Luo Tian cursed, slapping Sun Kemin's face hard and sending him flying back.

The next moment, the Threshold True Immortal Ghost King moved. Its black hand was clenched as if holding a sword.

"Clang..." As the Ghost King clenched its hand, Sun Kemin's ghost-headed sword also trembled. The iron rings on the blade continuously collided with the back, as if trying to break free from Sun Kemin's grip.

"Don't let this sword fall into the Ghost King's hands. If he gets it, this Ghost King will break through to True Immortal and gain sentience. Then we'll all die!" Gu Qianxue shouted.

"You help Sun Kemin, I'll disrupt this one!" Luo Tian had already made a plan before Gu Qianxue finished speaking, addressing Yu Changtian.

"Good!" Yu Changtian wasn't an ordinary person. Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, he moved his hands, and two water dragons emerged from his hands. They wrapped around Sun Kemin and the ghost-headed sword.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian's lips twitched as he rushed toward the Ghost King. His foot stepped forward with his signature "Seven Stomps."

"Roar..." The Ghost King, though not fully intelligent, conveyed a sense of disdain. Its black fist swung and met Luo Tian's foot.

"Crack..." Next, a breaking sound rose from Luo Tian's leg. His golden leg image collapsed instantly. Luo Tian flew backward like an arrow, colliding with multiple tombs and flying out a hundred feet before finally landing on the ground in a messy heap.

"My leg is broken... my internal organs are also severely injured. The gap is too big!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly. It was only because of his thick skin that he survived. A Heavenly Immortal Initial or even Intermediate would have been killed by this Ghost King's punch.

"Roar..." The Ghost King, seeing Luo Tian still alive, roared angrily. It was angry at not killing this weak ant.

"Buzz..." Next, the Ghost King raised its hand high and made a sword gesture. However, the ghost-headed sword still trembled but was trapped with Yu Changtian and Sun Kemin.

Even without this sword, it still sent a blade aura from the Ghost King's hand. It was more accurately described as a sword intent, overwhelming and terrifying.

"This is really over!" Luo Tian looked at the blade shadow coming toward him. He smiled bitterly, feeling that no matter how many methods he had, they were useless against absolute power.

"Despair. I haven't felt this in thousands of years, but the gap is too big!" Luo Tian's face showed a bitter smile.

As Luo Tian smiled, that overwhelming sword intent sliced through the black sky and appeared before him. Even Luo Tian didn't react in time, instinctively raising his arm. But he knew it was useless; he would become the Ghost King's victim.

"Done..." Yu Changtian's face showed a bitter smile. Gu Qianxue's eyes flickered slightly, cutting the four black threads and preparing to flee.

"Crack..." But suddenly, a thunderous sound echoed. It sounded like something had broken. There was no sight of Luo Tian being split in two.

"Cough... cough..." Luo Tian coughed blood, his eyes filled with disbelief. His entire arm was broken but had blocked the Ghost King's attack.

"Clang..." Next, a clear sound echoed. Luo Tian instantly knew what had saved him—the Hell's Three-Headed Dog collar, sealed since the three-headed dog was imprisoned. It had always been in his hand.

"Black!" Luo Tian roared, as the collar was closely related to the three-headed dog. He truly worried about it breaking and causing problems for the three-headed dog.

"Roar..." But soon, Luo Tian realized his worry was unnecessary. A low roar echoed beneath him, shaking the earth.

Next, black qi spread. Lightning intertwined within it. A massive black creature appeared before Luo Tian, with three enormous heads. Its cold fangs glowed with an icy light, illuminating the darkness.

The three heads howled at the sky. A thunderous aura spread from its massive body, more terrifyingly, when this creature appeared, all ghosts in the Tianlong Cemetery trembled. This included four Heavenly Immortal Peak ghosts and even the Ghost King that had almost killed Luo Tian.

"Black!" Luo Tian looked at this massive creature, his aura even making him cautious.

"Woof..." The three-headed dog heard Luo Tian's call and barked three times. Then it licked Luo Tian's body with its tongue.

"Take them and run quickly!" Luo Tian grabbed a pill, putting it in his mouth to support himself. He told the three-headed dog, though he was certain the three-headed dog wasn't a match for the Ghost King.

"Roar..." But the three-headed dog growled, seeing Luo Tian's broken leg and arm. Its three massive heads glared at the Ghost King and roared again.

"Buzz..." An invisible vortex emerged from the three heads of the three-headed dog, spreading outward.

"Ahh..." As the three-headed dog roared, the Threshold True Immortal Ghost King trembled. Black qi spread from it, attracted by the invisible vortex. The four Heavenly Immortal Peak ghosts also trembled, their power weakening and showing submission.

"Enemy! Compared to the Ghost-Controlling Seal, black is the greatest enemy of these ghosts!" Luo Tian's mind was shaken. He hadn't expected such a reversal.

"Hell's Three-Headed Dog, the ruler of hell, feeding on countless evil ghosts!" Gu Qianxue's eyes were also shocked. She hadn't expected Luo Tian to have such a creature.

"Black..." Luo Tian's eyes glowed slightly. He quickly stopped the three-headed dog. It was a Threshold True Immortal—there were few in the lower realms. If used properly, it would be a powerful ally.

"Roar..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, the three-headed dog's silver eyes glowed with confusion. But it stopped anyway and growled at the Ghost King.

The Ghost King obviously had some intelligence. The four Heavenly Immortal Peak ghosts also knelt before the three-headed dog, showing submission.

"Let them go back!" Luo Tian saw this scene and told the three-headed dog.

With the three-headed dog present, a Ghost King and four Heavenly Immortal Peak ghosts stood up slowly. They were slightly stunned but exhaled black qi, which was absorbed into the Ghost-Controlling Seal. A mysterious connection instantly passed through Luo Tian's mind, making his face show joy. After those black qi entered the Ghost-Controlling Seal, it directly expanded to a high-level.

"If I had known you were so变态, I would have awakened you directly!" Luo Tian smiled.

The three-headed dog opened its mouth again. The ghost-headed sword, restrained by Yu Changtian, was finally freed from Sun Kemin's grip. Black qi flew out of Sun Kemin's body, forming a black shadow.

"Artifact Spirit!" Gu Qianxue's face showed excitement. Once this artifact spirit was subdued, it would naturally become the owner of the ghost-headed sword.
