"Boom..." The late-stage Soul-Annihilation stone statue was cleaved by a long blade, striking Leng Qiuchan's black robes, causing people to gasp in alarm.

Yet instead of the stone statue shattering as expected, Leng Qiuchan's figure gradually dissipated.

"Shadow!" Luo Tian roared, his eyes filled with disbelief as he watched Leng Qiuchan reappear before the second stone statue.

"Unexpectedly, she's mastered the Seventh Step of Sealing Heaven!" Jin Wulong said with admiration, watching Leng Qiuchan's shadow disperse once more.

Luo Tian also marveled at Leng Qiuchan's progress. The Seventh Step of Sealing Heaven was a feat few in the Yuling Sect could achieve.

Ten copies of Leng Qiuchan appeared before the remaining stone statues, but all were mere shadows that dispersed upon contact.

"Ugh..." Leng Qiuchan's face showed a thin layer of sweat, clearly exhausted from unleashing the Seventh Step.

"Did you see?" Leng Qiuchan's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, accompanied by an imprint that revealed how she'd mastered the Seventh Step.

Luo Tian didn't hesitate, immediately sitting cross-legged on the ground and closing his eyes to digest the images transmitted by Leng Qiuchan.

Seeing Luo Tian sit cross-legged, others looked puzzled, unsure what he was doing.

"Good thing this statue isn't moving forward. It must be the effect of Xiu He Tian Luo," Jin Wulong sighed, then stepped back to test if he could break through. After all, others had tried but he hadn't.

"Boom..." However, Jin Wulong's poor footwork caused him to retreat after reaching the seventh statue, paying the price of another statue advancing to late-stage Soul-Annihilation.

"I'll go!" Zhou Ziyang sighed, rushing to the sixth. Chen Changsheng also reached the sixth.

Others tried but no one could break through, resulting in all twelve statues becoming late-stage Soul-Annihilation, radiating powerful fluctuations.

"We can't try anymore! If they shatter and enter the Soul-Consolidation realm, we'll be in big trouble. We have to rely on Xiu He Tian Luo and Leng Qiuchan," Jin Wulong said, his face grim.

But just then, Luo Tian who had been sitting cross-legged suddenly opened his eyes, a habitual smirk on his lips.

Chapter 666: Body-World Sovereign

Seeing Luo Tian open his eyes, Xu Liyi and others turned their attention to him. Though they didn't know what he was contemplating, they knew it must relate to passing through the twelve statues.

"Late-stage Soul-Annihilation!" Luo Tian looked at the twelve statues, his face puzzled as he scanned the eight people.

Xu Liyi and Jin Wulong's faces turned red, feeling awkward.

"Leave it to us. If you can't make it, retreat to the hall!" Luo Tian ignored them, smiling slightly.

"Cut the crap. Do you really think you can pass so easily?" Shangguan Hongtu sneered, disbelieving Luo Tian could clear the statues so quickly.

"If I make it, you'll submit. From now on, I'll respect you and give you a bow whenever we meet!" Shangguan Hongtu smirked, his eyes full of disdain.

"Good!" Luo Tian smiled again. "If I can't make it, I'll do the same as you said!" He smiled again, no longer wasting words.

Hearing Luo Tian's confidence, Shangguan Hongtu felt a pang of anxiety. But seeing the twelve statues all at late-stage Soul-Annihilation, ten times harder than before, he still didn't believe Luo Tian could pass through. His confidence returned.

"Kid, you're about to bow to Luo Tian!" Xu Liyi smirked, his voice full of confidence in Luo Tian.

"Take care, everyone!" Luo Tian bowed to Jin Wulong and others before his feet flashed with wind, vanishing instantly.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before the first statue, leaving a shadow.

"One... two..." In the blink of an eye, seven shadows of Luo Tian appeared before the first seven statues.

"Boom... boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed as the statues raised their weapons, slashing at Luo Tian. They missed, kicking up clouds of dust that obscured people's vision.

"One... two..." The group couldn't even track Luo Tian's speed, relying only on the sound of weapons hitting the ground to count how many statues he'd dodged.

"Eight... nine..." Shangguan Hongtu's face showed tension. His confident expression gradually turned uncertain. After the seventh sound, each impact on the ground felt like a hammer striking his heart.

"Boom... boom... boom..." Three powerful collisions echoed, making Chen Changsheng and Xu Liyi's faces light up with joy.

But Shangguan Hongtu's face turned pale, muttering "Impossible."

"Kid! You've been beaten so many times and still don't learn. You're really stupid!" Xu Liyi's sharp tongue began mocking, though he didn't curse Shangguan Hongtu directly, it was more painful than actual insults.

"Everyone, I'll go first. Take care of your safety!" Luo Tian spoke, his body flashing toward the cave entrance.

Luo Tian's face showed urgency. He didn't stop because he heard thunderous sounds and felt powerful fluctuations in his mind, forcing him to accelerate.

"100 zhang... 1000 zhang..." Luo Tian transformed into a rainbow of seven colors, flying three ten-thousand zhang before finally exiting the cave.

"Boom..." As soon as Luo Tian appeared, a powerful thunderous sound drew his attention.

In the distance, Tiantian and Leng Qiuchan were fighting a middle-aged man. Xiu's figure constantly appeared before the man, each strike cunningly precise.

"Powerful!" The moment Luo Tian saw the middle-aged man, he felt his power. His sword-like eyebrows were raised, wearing a blue silk robe. The man radiated immense pressure. Even Soul-Consolidation realm experts would dare not move under this aura - it was the pressure of one who had ruled for years, controlling many lives.

Though Tiantian and Leng Qiuchan were attacking the man, they gained no advantage. Instead, they were constantly pushed back.

"Haha! You three little brats still dare to fight me? Though I haven't fully succeeded, now I'm no longer someone you can defeat. When I fully possess this body, it'll be your end!" The man laughed loudly, his voice familiar to Luo Tian - the voice of the cave spirit.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing Luo Tian arrive, Tiantian and Leng Qiuchan showed relief. But in that moment of distraction, the man struck them both with a palm, causing them to cough blood.

Tiantian was better off, but Leng Qiuchan transformed into a meteor, her blood forming an arc as she flew backward toward the hall's wall.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian activated his footwork, becoming a shadow that vanished instantly. In the next moment, he caught Leng Qiuchan mid-air.

But Luo Tian had underestimated the man's strength. In catching Leng Qiuchan, he was also thrown backward.

"Boom..." Luo Tian crashed into the wall, his body unharmed but his face showing intense shock.

Luo Tian was stunned by the man's physical power - it completely crushed him. Even his current body wouldn't match the man.

"Buzz..." Xiu's figure emerged from the void, his face cold. His black sword pierced the man's back but only penetrated an inch without causing real damage.

"Kid, I'm giving you one last chance. Submit to me, and I'll let you live. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless. You should know how powerful I am now - you're no match!"

"Do you know who the body's owner is? You've probably guessed. Yes, it's my former master, a Sovereign-level powerhouse - Jiang Hongsheng's body!" The man smiled triumphantly, rubbing his fists as he looked at Luo Tian and the others.

Chapter 667: Cave Spirit

Unmatchable. At this moment, Luo Tian and his companions all felt the same thought - this man's body was too strong. Even Tiantian's attacks couldn't harm him. The four of them had no idea how to fight the man.

"Submit or die. Consider it for three breaths," the man said with a smile to Luo Tian and his companions.

"Also, that woman can be my concubine. I've never been a man before, so I really want to try what it's like!" The man ignored Luo Tian and continued speaking.

"Go to hell..." Luo Tian sneered, his aura suddenly surged as he activated the Seventh Soul.

Feeling Luo Tian's sudden power increase, Tiantian and Xiu, as well as Leng Qiuchan, showed surprise. But it was brief, not taking it too seriously. Though Luo Tian's aura was formidable, defeating the cave spirit fused with a Sovereign-level corpse was still difficult.

"Sky Wolf Transformation!" Leng Qiuchan roared, her little wolf emerging from her Nailing Bag. It howled, transforming into a blue light that entered Leng Qiuchan's body.

At the same time, Leng Qiuchan also entered Soul-Consolidation. Her aura was no less than Luo Tian's, while Xiu finally revealed his secret, entering the early Soul-Consolidation stage.

"Four Soul-Consolidations? Do you think that's a threat to me?" The cave spirit's eyes showed mockery. He kicked off the ground, flying toward Luo Tian.

Seeing the cave spirit rushing at him, Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination. His energy surged into his fist, veins bulging as he launched the Doom-Annihilation Fist.

"Boom..." Luo Tian and the cave spirit's fists collided, producing thunderous sounds.

In the collision, Luo Tian was thrown back. His fist cracked, blood trickled from his mouth as he crashed into the wall reinforced by a formation. He seemed embedded in it.

"Green Wood Emperor!" Leng Qiuchan sneered, the Green Wood Emperor Sword凝聚, radiating a suppressing aura as it slashed at the cave spirit.

The void was pierced by black light. Xiu's voice appeared behind the cave spirit, two swords fused together with intricate seals on them, emitting a tearing aura as they pierced the cave spirit's back.

"Ten Thousand Heaven Sword! Sword Determines Heaven and Earth!" Tiantian also attacked, a golden sword in hand. Golden sword shadows slashed at the cave spirit.

"Trivial tricks. If I fully fused with my master's body, you wouldn't even withstand my aura!" The cave spirit knocked Luo Tian away with a punch. He showed no fear at the three's attacks, standing there as if looking at fools.

The three's attacks arrived instantly. The cave spirit's surroundings were filled with dust, the void shattered, and the dust was sucked into it. Finally, the cave spirit remained calm.

"Don't waste your strength! You don't understand the power of a Sovereign-level powerhouse. My master has been dead for countless years, but this body remains strong and hasn't faded. A Sovereign-level body is immortal - it can be considered another form of eternal life!" The cave spirit stood still, speaking softly.

"So strong! We can't harm him at all!" Luo Tian fell from the wall, his face showing bitterness.

The others also showed disbelief. They sighed at the Sovereign-level powerhouse's strength, their eyes gradually filled with bitterness.

"He hasn't fully fused yet. We still have a chance. If he does, this cave will be his. With the domain unique to Sovereign-level power, we won't even have a chance to fight back!" Tiantian shouted loudly, ignoring his battered appearance as he flew toward the cave spirit.

Hearing Tiantian's words, Luo Tian and the others showed fierce determination. Their bodies flashed as they surrounded the cave spirit again.

Xiu no longer hid in the shadows, revealing his form. His dual-colored energy surrounded him as he rushed toward the cave spirit.

"Imperial Seal!" Luo Tian stood still, golden light filling his hands. The Yellow Pole Seal merged instantly with the Opening Heaven Seal that flew from the void. Three great seals slowly fused together.

"Three martial arts combined? Interesting. I've noticed you're the most talented among these people. If you were truly Soul-Consolidation, even late-stage Soul-Consolidation, I'd be wary. But now, you're still too weak!" The cave spirit showed a hint of fear upon seeing Luo Tian's three martial arts combined.

"Buzz..." A massive pressure formed on Luo Tian's hands. The characters "Heaven, Earth, and Man" appeared on the golden seal, radiating a terrifying aura as it pressed toward the cave spirit.

After completing the three seals, Luo Tian didn't stop. His hands quickly changed, not giving the cave spirit a moment to breathe.

"Boom..." Leng Qiuchan and the others retreated, fearing being caught in Luo Tian's martial arts. Their hands also flashed with shadows.

"Sky Wolf Demonic Slash!"

"Life-Annihilation Sword Qi!"

"Wave Upon Wave Kill!" Leng Qiuchan and the others showed wild expressions, revealing their secret techniques. Three sky-level martial arts flew out, radiating a furious aura as they attacked the cave spirit.

Feeling four overwhelming sky-level martial arts, the cave spirit's eyes finally showed concern. However, he could only rely on his Sovereign-level body without fully fusing, unable to use any energy. This was his only weakness.

A powerful fluctuation directly attacked the cave spirit, making the entire void change color. The powerful formation barrier cracked, showing signs of breaking. Invisible fluctuations made Luo Tian's group's clothes flutter.

A thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian's ears, shaking their minds as if they'd explode.

At this moment, Xu Liyi and the other eight were also in a fierce battle. They had retreated to the previous hall, not knowing why twelve statues had advanced to late-stage Soul-Annihilation. They were in a tough spot, not daring to move the statues for fear of them shattering and entering the Soul-Consolidation realm, which would be truly troublesome.

"This sound!" Xu Liyi and the others showed a serious expression. Their eyes revealed shock. The thunderous sound had even made their blood flow unstable, shaking them.

Chapter 668: Shattered Daoist Cliff

"This power... even Soul-Consolidation can't withstand it?" Xu Liyi's mouth twitched, feeling the powerful fluctuation with a hint of fear.

"Damn it, you still have time to care about others!" Shangguan Hongtu cursed, looking at the twelve statues with a face almost crying.

Luo Han and others showed a bitter expression. Their view, after the powerful fluctuation's impact, three statues had shattered and disappeared from sight. The other nine statues also had cracks, showing signs of breaking.

"Damn it!" Xu Liyi cursed and quickly moved away.

"Crack..." The shattered statues gathered instantly. As the statues regrouped, their power surged dramatically. Under Jin Wulong's eyes, it rapidly climbed to early Soul-Consolidation.

"This damn thing, we'll have to fight!" Xu Liyi roared, his body flashing as he dodged the statues' attacks.

Others also began to desperately dodge the statues. The eight were forced to jump around as twelve statues chased them.

...

Luo Tian and his companions, however, were unaware of this. Their spiritual awareness quickly penetrated the dust clouds, revealing a look of joy in their eyes.

"Hit!" Luo Tian and his companions trembled. Their spiritual awareness showed the cave spirit's face pale, breathing heavily with a torn robe.

"Again!" Luo Tian roared, golden mountains flying from the void. His face showed madness.

"Crushing Mountains Technique!" Luo Tian roared, not directly pressing the golden mountain toward the cave spirit. Instead, he released a thread of gray energy - the Primordial Power left by Sichuan Chen and Jin Emperor in Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian knew that强者 who had grasped a thread of Primordial Power could infuse it into martial arts, enhancing them. Though he didn't know why the Primordial Power fused with three seals and one to create that terrifying explosion, he guessed it was due to the martial arts fusion.

Seeing Luo Tian's actions, the other three, having inherited Primordial Power from the Twelve Emperors, also flashed cold light. They each released their martial arts with a thread of gray energy.

"Damn it! Primordial Power, the inheritance of the Twelve Emperors!" The cave spirit, who had just caught his breath, saw their attacks again with Primordial Power. His face finally changed, showing fear.

At this moment, the cave spirit was relying solely on his powerful Sovereign body. Without energy, martial arts with Primordial Power could penetrate the body and harm its essence. After all, he wasn't human. He had cultivated for countless years to gain consciousness and a semblance of human soul.

While the cave spirit was thinking, their martial arts had already gathered terrifying power and slowly converged toward the cave spirit.

"Boom..." The entire hall shook under their martial arts. The already unstable ninth-level formation barrier cracked, showing signs of breaking. The powerful fluctuation directly affected the cave.

The dust instantly enveloped the four and the cave spirit, spreading outward.

At that moment, Xu Liyi's group, who were fighting twelve statues, showed fear. The statues attacking them shattered instantly, and the explosion force swept them in.

Outside Daoist Cliff, Gu Qianxue and others showed anxious expressions watching the towering mountain of Daoist Cliff. It had been ten days since Luo Tian and others entered Daoist Cliff.

Ten days of worry for Gu Qianxue. Though she was confident in Luo Tian's strength, a Sovereign-level powerhouse's cave wasn't easy to enter. To people, Sovereign-level was like a god.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed from Daoist Cliff. Then, the formation barrier outside began to crack, terrifying fluctuations shaking people's minds.

"Retreat!" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei showed surprise, shouting to those behind them. Their figures burst out.

Others naturally felt something was wrong with Daoist Cliff. Hearing Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's words, they all burst out, thousands of people becoming streaks of light three ten-thousand zhang away.

"Why did that fluctuation make me feel a bit scared?" People showed admiration, looking toward Daoist Cliff.

In people's discussions, Daoist Cliff emitted a thunderous sound again. Under people's eyes, it shattered completely. The sky above Daoist Cliff began to collapse in large areas, the clear sky revealing vast darkness.

"Daoist Cliff exploded!" Gu Lei showed worry. The wild power, even from afar, made people tremble.

"Those Luo Tian... they..." People showed a sense of admiration but didn't believe Luo Tian and others could survive that explosion.

An hour passed, the dust slowly dispersed. A thousand-zhang deep pit appeared in Gu Qianxue's view, causing people to gasp.

Gu Qianxue flashed her body, showing anxiety. She instantly appeared at the center of the pit, her face showing anxiety. When she saw several black bodies, her heart finally relaxed.

"Still alive!" Gu Qianxue sighed lightly. She found Luo Tian's aura and instantly appeared before him, her wood-element energy pouring into his body.

"Cough... cough..." Luo Tian opened his eyes, showing a bitter smile. He looked at Gu Qianxue's face and smiled, revealing his white teeth.

At the same time, the others were awakened by Tianyuan Continent disciples. They showed a sense of admiration. Even the usually calm Xiu had an expression of surviving a disaster. They hadn't expected martial arts with Primordial Power to be so powerful.

At this moment, the twelve people were severely injured. Though they wouldn't die, they needed time to recover.

"They should be dead!" Luo Tian and his companions exchanged glances, looking around for the cave spirit's figure.

"Hey! Who are you? I don't recognize you!" A Tianyuan Continent genius asked the black figure being treated.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian and his companions cursed, showing shock.

Chapter 669: Leng Qiuchan's Demise

Seeing the black figure being treated by the Tianyuan Continent genius, Luo Tian and his companions cursed and tried to attack but couldn't move at all.

"Don't treat him. He's the enemy!" Tiantian spoke, his eyes again showing concern.

"Quickly kill him!" Before the disciple could react, Tiantian reminded everyone, his face showing anxiety.

Hearing Tiantian's words, the Tianyuan Continent genius immediately flew far away. His face showed fear. A person who could make Luo Tian and his companions so helpless was beyond his ability to deal with.

The cave spirit opened his eyes. His body's fine cracks slowly gathered. He looked at Luo Tian and the others with intense hatred.

"Just a little more, just a little more I would have died!" The cave spirit spoke, his voice also weak but he slowly stood up.

"I'll make you all die!" The cave spirit's face showed strong hatred. He was the cave spirit of Daoist Cliff. Now that Daoist Cliff had shattered, it was a fatal blow to him. His eyes were filled with killing intent toward Luo Tian and the others.

"Die!" The cave spirit transformed into a black line, rushing toward Luo Tian with wild killing intent.

"Qianxue, run!" Luo Tian pushed Gu Qianxue away but forgot his current state. He wasn't her match.

"I want to see what this guy can do!" Gu Qianxue felt the pressure from the cave spirit's body but couldn't escape because Luo Tian was behind her. She wouldn't let Luo Tian die.

Her sword made a sound of contention. Gu Qianxue's energy filled her body, her face showing madness as she waited for the cave spirit to approach.

"Late-stage Soul-Annihilation? You dare to block me?" The cave spirit sneered. His black fist radiated terrifying fluctuations. If Gu Qianxue was hit, she wouldn't survive, even if she didn't die, it would be no better.

Though Gu Qianxue was a genius, she was still inferior to Luo Tian and the others. Her body didn't have Primordial Power or any secret techniques to reach Soul-Consolidation.

After all, Luo Tian and the others had only reached Soul-Consolidation through secret techniques, barely forcing the cave spirit to this point. And now they were in such a state.

"Run!" Luo Tian's eyes turned blood-red, not wanting to see Gu Qianxue harmed. His spiritual awareness continuously transmitted messages to her.

But Gu Qianxue didn't move, showing a determined expression. She looked like a wife guarding her husband.

Though it seemed slow, this all happened in an instant. Others hadn't reacted when a black figure suddenly rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Big sister!" Gu Lei shouted, his purple energy filling him as he rushed toward Gu Qianxue.

"Boom..." But just as people were anxious, a black figure appeared before the cave spirit. Her beauty stunned everyone.

The cave spirit showed no mercy. In his eyes, these four all deserved to die. He didn't even think before punching directly at the black figure's chest.

"Crack..." The black figure flew backward, her body making a sound. Blood instantly stained the shadow.

"This!" At this moment, everyone had reached Luo Tian and his companions, protecting them.

"No!" Luo Tian's face showed madness. He watched the blood-stained figure flying backward and shouted loudly.

Gu Qianxue was also shocked. She looked at the falling figure, her face showing disbelief. Then she instantly appeared before the fallen body, her face showing care. Tears fell from Gu Qianxue's eyes.

"Take me to him!" Leng Qiuchan, her face showing weakness, her life rapidly fading, pointed to Luo Tian.

Gu Qianxue nodded gently. She carried Leng Qiuchan's thin body to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes turned blood-red. He looked at Leng Qiuchan, his heart feeling like it was being torn. His body had just recovered some strength but he gently held Leng Qiuchan in his arms.

"Why are you so foolish!" Luo Tian spoke softly, tears falling on Leng Qiuchan's face.

"Ha... I don't regret it. Using my life to save yours, I have no regrets!" Leng Qiuchan's face showed regret. She leaned her head into Luo Tian's chest, smiling with affection. This embrace, she had imagined countless times.

Luo Tian said nothing. His recovering energy was sent into Leng Qiuchan's body without regard for his life. Gu Qianxue also placed her hand on Leng Qiuchan's back, green energy surrounding it.

"Cough... cough..." Leng Qiuchan coughed lightly. She spat out more blood, but her face had a rosy flush like a final burst of vitality.

"Do you know what my happiest time was? It was when I was in the Locking Soul Tower, living like an ordinary person. That time had no great strength, no genius光环, but it made me remember forever!"

"Now I'm strong, even about to surpass my father. But I'm not happy! Because I know you can't accept me. Your heart has a barrier, it can't hold anyone else!" Leng Qiuchan's face showed peace as she spoke.

Luo Tian also showed a nostalgic expression. He thought of the time with the Tiger Clan in the Locking Soul Tower, of this woman who had been hurt by him time and again but still sacrificed her life for him.

"Qianxue, you two must be happy. I really hope you're both happy!" Leng Qiuchan smiled, finally closing her eyes on Luo Tian's chest.

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared to the sky. His eyes quickly turned blood-red, holding Leng Qiuchan's still warm body like a child, crying.

The sword made a sound. A figure appeared before Luo Tian, his eyes like lightning looking at Luo Tian with an icy expression.

"Go away..." Duan Xingchen swung his sword, its sharp tip pointing at Luo Tian. His eyes were blood-red. He kicked Luo Tian away.

"You're not worthy to hold her!" Duan Xingchen's voice was like a cold wind from the abyss, brushing over Luo Tian's heart. Luo Tian slowly raised his head.

"Old Duan..." Zheng Xin showed a complex expression looking at Duan Xingchen. He knew that over the years, Duan Xingchen had been devoted to Leng Qiuchan. Now that Leng Qiuchan was dead, the most heartbroken person was Duan Xingchen.

Chapter 670: Wretched One, Do You Remember Me?

Seeing Duan Xingchen's cold words without any emotion, Luo Tian was struck by lightning. His eyes showed bitterness: "I'm unworthy. Yes, I am. But I'll avenge Qiuchan!"

Luo Tian's eyes showed madness. The final page of the Chronological Scripture in his mind slowly opened again, his gaze filled with cold killing intent toward the cave spirit.

"Go back. No need for you!" Luo Tian sneered, his blood-colored energy flowing back into the Chronological Scripture.

"Everyone, help me hold them!" Luo Tian spoke to thousands around him, his voice filled with cold killing intent.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the people around showed a battle spirit and stood in front of Luo Tian and his companions.

"Let me refine it!" Luo Tian roared, the Five Elements Refining Energy directly acting on the golden energy ball placed in his dantian by Jin Emperor.

The golden ball contained Jin Emperor's entire energy. This pearl could elevate Luo Tian to late-stage Soul-Consolidation, even peak.

Jin Emperor's original plan was for Luo Tian to refine it gradually. But now, Luo Tian's mind was clouded by hatred. He didn't think twice and used his spiritual awareness as a blade of seals, fiercely slicing the golden ball.

"Boom..." A wild energy instantly filled Luo Tian's meridians. The Five Elements Refining Energy quickly operated, converting the dense golden energy into other six elements, rapidly flowing through Luo Tian's meridians.

"Hmph! You people also want to block me? It's a dream!" The cave spirit showed mockery.

It wasn't that the cave spirit was arrogant. These people's strongest were only late-stage Soul-Annihilation. Even Luo Tian and Tiantian couldn't harm this body. The cave spirit had no fear of these people who were even weaker than Luo Tian.

Although these people were numerous, at a certain level, even with numbers, it was useless. Like a group of body-refining realm warriors challenging an energy-soul realm powerhouse, they had no threat.

"Then let all of you die!" The cave spirit coldly spoke, like a ancient beast rushing toward Gu Qianxue and others.

"Kill him!" Gu Qianxue's face showed cold killing intent. Her sword hummed, transforming into a torrent of sword qi that rushed toward the cave spirit.

Others also showed concern. Their hands lit up with various lights, martial arts flying from their hands.

"Boom..." The combined martial arts of everyone, with terrifying power, flew toward the cave spirit.

"Go away..." The cave spirit sneered. These Tianyuan Continent geniuses' martial arts surprised him, but he didn't take them seriously. With confidence in his body, he stood there and let the martial arts hit him.

"Crack..." Countless martial arts made the sky change. The void collapsed, all with terrifying pressure, rushing toward the cave spirit.

Dust rose again. Terrifying fluctuations shattered people's spiritual awareness, forcing them to squint at the dust.

"Did he die this time?" Wang Tianxiang stood among the crowd, his face showing hope as he looked at the cave spirit enveloped in dust.

Others also looked toward the dust with admiration, secretly calculating whether the cave spirit had died.

"Ah... just you little shrimp to hurt me?" Cold and mocking voice echoed. The cave spirit slowly walked out of the dust, his body with fine cracks but recovering visibly fast.

"This..." Gu Lei and others showed great surprise, looking at the cave spirit walking out.
