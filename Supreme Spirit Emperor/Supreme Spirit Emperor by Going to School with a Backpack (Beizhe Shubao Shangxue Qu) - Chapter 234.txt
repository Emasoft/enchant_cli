“You all seem to have forgotten, my greatest reliance is not the Epoch Bell, nor this Spirit Transport Cauldron, but the Killing Heaven Bow!” Luo Tian’s face bore a faint smile as his resolve solidified. He intended to sacrifice one or two of them, then use the Heavenly Palace Seal to teleport directly into the Ancient Heaven Palace. As Master Ling Mengxiao had once said, this seal could transport him there instantly—this was Luo Tian’s greatest reliance.

After musing, Luo Tian slowly drew the Killing Heaven Bow. His gaze swept over the three men before settling on Feng Jiutian.

With bowstring taut, his eyes turned to the void. Seeing that the saintly peak powerhouses had yet to intervene, Luo Tian’s heart slightly steadied.

At the moment Luo Tian lifted the Killing Heaven Bow, Feng Jiutian and his companions turned pale. They had not expected Luo Tian to still be able to draw the bow in such a state.

“Another saintly heir is about to fall!” The crowd saw Luo Tian, drenched in blood, drawing the Killing Heaven Bow and knew another saintly heir would perish.

“You’ve provoked me repeatedly. I’ll start with you!” Luo Tian fixed his gaze on Feng Jiutian.

“Dragon Emperor Seal!” Feng Jiutian’s face turned ashen. Luo Tian had previously slain a saintly peak with the Killing Heaven Bow, forcing Feng Jiutian into tension.

“Roar…” The divine dragon qi erupted from the Dragon Emperor Seal, forming a golden dragon that coiled around Feng Jiutian.

“Nirvana Nine Transformations!” Realizing the divine dragon qi’s defense was insufficient, Feng Jiutian unleashed his Nirvana Nine Transformations, transforming into a crimson eggshell wrapped in the divine dragon qi.

“You’ll taste my suffering now!” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a grim smile. Blood trickled down his arms again, and the holy blood clung to the black demonic arrow as it shot forth from the Killing Heaven Bow.

The black demonic arrow, under the dark starry sky, moved at an unparalleled speed. It collided instantly with the divine dragon qi.

“Pfth…” The Dragon Emperor Seal, a pseudo-epoch relic of destruction, was not adept at defense. It barely held for a third of the demonic arrow’s power before being pierced through, rushing toward Feng Jiutian after his Nirvana transformation.

“Crack…” A brittle sound echoed. Though the crimson eggshell was formidable, Luo Tian possessed the梵天攻杀术 (Fotian Attack Techniques), the true nemesis of Nirvana Nine Transformations.

A mist of blood rose, and the eggshell shattered. Feng Jiutian’s half-body exploded in a cacophony of screams, appearing before the onlookers.

Chapter 1019: A Big Shot Steps In

At the entrance of the Demon Domain to the Fire Domain, Luo Tian held the Killing Heaven Bow, his face pale. He gazed at Feng Jiutian’s half-body explosion, frowning slightly—unlike expected, Feng Jiutian had only exploded a single half-body.

This was Luo Tian’s decisive shot. He felt somewhat dissatisfied, as his holy medicine’s potency had dwindled. The restoration of his body had consumed the holy medicine, and without it, his arms might not have regrown. Thus, he could only activate the Killing Heaven Bow three times; further use would demand his own holy energy.

Though his holy energy surpassed others, Luo Tian knew his true strength allowed him to draw two arrows at most.

“Luo Tian!” Feng Jiutian gritted his teeth. Though he possessed an almost immortal body, he quickly restored his flesh but was weak and desperate, his eyes burning with madness as they locked onto Luo Tian.

“I’ll fight you to the death!” Feng Jiutian showed no fear, knowing that his ancestral ancestor in the void would not let him die.

“Roar…” Golden light flared as Feng Jiutian poured his final strength into the Dragon Emperor Seal, pressing down toward Luo Tian.

At the same time, Li Tianyi’s face was pale as he activated the Heaven-Stilling Mallet toward Luo Tian.

Both had reached their limits. This effort burned their blood and essence; otherwise, they could not have activated the pseudo-epoch relics again.

This was their final attack. Whether successful or not, they had no strength left to fight further.

Yet Luo Tian fared little better. His gaze darkened as he watched the two pseudo-epoch relics above.

“I can’t block it! Even with the Killing Heaven Bow, blocking one is my limit!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Even with the Epoch Bell and Spirit Transport Cauldron, he could not withstand their collision.

“Roar…” But the next moment, a thunderous dragon roar stunned everyone. They turned their eyes to the two pseudo-epoch relics in the sky.

“What’s going on?” The crowd murmured, as the scene was bewildering. Even the three saintly peak powerhouses in the void opened their eyes, their aged faces showing disbelief.

Luo Tian, who had already grasped the Heavenly Palace Seal, was momentarily stunned by the scene.

In his vision, the golden Dragon Emperor Seal radiated brilliant light. Next, that seal, which had been pressing down toward Luo Tian, suddenly reversed and collided with the other pseudo-epoch relic, the Heaven-Stilling Mallet.

“Crack…” Thunder rumbled beneath the stars. The two pseudo-epoch relics collided with a terrifying surge, sweeping over Luo Tian and others but causing no real harm.

The Heaven-Stilling Mallet flew toward Li Tianyi, yet the Dragon Emperor Seal did not return to Feng Jiutian but slowly drifted toward Luo Tian.

“What’s going on? I’m a bit confused!” A large man in the crowd scratched his head, staring at the scene above. He could not fathom why the Dragon Emperor Seal and Heaven-Stilling Mallet would collide.

“Feng Jiutian, what do you mean by this?” Li Tianyi’s lips trembled white. His eyes brimmed with endless fury as he stared at Feng Jiutian, exhausted and unable to continue fighting. His body swayed dangerously.

“I don’t know either!” Feng Jiutian’s face was as pale as paper. His condition was no better than Li Tianyi’s.

Feng Jiutian gestured, attempting to reclaim the Dragon Emperor Seal. Yet his connection with it seemed severed by the seal itself.

Luo Tian was also stunned, watching the Dragon Emperor Seal slowly approach him, shrinking to palm size and emitting a gentle warmth.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian extended his hand, allowing the Dragon Emperor Seal to land on it. Instantly, it appeared in his palm.

Luo Tian felt no weight at all. The Dragon Emperor Seal now seemed like a docile child, radiating soft energy. Divine dragon qi naturally emerged from the seal and flowed into Luo Tian’s body, restoring his injuries.

Luo Tian carefully observed the Dragon Emperor Seal and soon discovered the issue: a single drop of golden holy blood was being absorbed by it.

“Things have returned to their rightful owner. I suppose I’m half a master now!” Luo Tian smiled, his heart elated. He had acquired another pseudo-epoch relic.

The logic was simple: the Dragon Emperor Seal originally belonged to Long Zhan Tian. Though ancient, it still remembered his aura. Luo Tian’s blood shared an inseparable bond with Long Jie’s; in essence, Luo Tian’s blood carried Long Jie’s lineage, and vice versa.

When Luo Tian’s blood-stained demonic arrow pierced the Dragon Emperor Seal earlier, it sensed Long Jie’s aura and thus would not attack someone bearing his blood.

“Haha, Feng Jiutian! You tried to steal but lost everything!” Luo Tian laughed, drawing another demonic arrow onto the bowstring.

“Damn Long Zhan Tian!” Feng Jiutian wanted to curse, but the cold demonic arrow aimed at him made his heart tremble.

“I’ll see if you die this time!” Luo Tian’s eyes held cold detachment, his voice sending a shiver down Feng Jiutian’s spine.

“Ancestral ancestor, save me!” Feng Jiutian finally could not endure, transmitting a mental call to the saintly peak powerhouse in the void. This was Feng Clan’s saintly peak ancestral ancestor, one of the eight in the Demon Domain.

No need for Feng Jiutian’s call. The old man extended his massive hand, a crimson one as vast as a continent, pressing down toward Luo Tian.

“Little scum, you must die today!” The old man’s cold voice echoed through the starry void, causing everyone to shiver instinctively.

Luo Tian was no exception. He had not yet released the demonic arrow but immediately retracted it, his eyes filled with madness.

“Endure this strike! I can then use the Heavenly Palace Seal to enter the Ancient Heaven Palace!” Luo Tian stared fiercely at the crimson hand, but cold sweat dripped from his forehead.

It was too strong. Luo Tian’s gap with a saintly peak powerhouse was insurmountable, entirely on another level. Blocking it was nearly impossible.

Worse still, two other saintly peak powerhouses had also attacked, sealing all his escape routes.

“Despicable old bastard!” Luo Tian’s face twisted with madness. He launched the Epoch Bell, Spirit Transport Cauldron, and Dragon Emperor Seal above his head.

“No use!” The cold voice echoed from the void, as if sentencing Luo Tian to death.

“Is a big shot involved? This overwhelming destruction aura is undoubtedly a saintly peak powerhouse. Which sect or clan’s power is it?” The crowd gasped, staring at the terrifying hand.

Yet they knew the three powerhouses would not reveal themselves. They must fear Diao Yuanshan’s previous threat. But now, anyone could guess these three saintly peak powerhouses were deeply connected to the saintly heirs.

“See but don’t speak!” The people knew this truth, yet no one dared to utter the three’s names.

“Hmph. You really took my words as nonsense!” As people believed Luo Tian was doomed, a cold pressure descended. A purple figure appeared before Luo Tian, its voice chilling the crowd.

“Hah…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, seeing the figure before him. He knew today he had no danger.

“Grandfather, you’ve finally arrived. If you hadn’t come, I might have died here!” Luo Tian smiled with a bitter expression, addressing the purple figure.

“Don’t worry. You won’t die. As long as there’s a life-threatening situation, I’ll sense it!” Diao Yuanshan smiled at Luo Tian.

“Damn!” Luo Tian mentally cursed but wore a respectful expression. After all, this old man could easily kill him.

“Diao Yuanshan!” The crowd’s faces lit up with excitement. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so valued by Diao Yuanshan, who had even left an imprint on him. If Luo Tian was in danger, he would arrive.

“From now on, who dares to touch Luo Tian in the Demon Domain!” The crowd sighed. Fortunately, they hadn’t attacked Luo Tian.

“Yet you did well, finding a chance in that dire situation. I’m truly impressed!” Diao Yuanshan’s face showed satisfaction, praising without hesitation.

“But it was a coincidence that the Mortal Domain’s old man entered the Epoch Realm!” Luo Tian sighed, recalling his karma. He cursed himself for not slapping himself.

“Don’t regret it. I also went there later. Even without you, that old man would have entered the Epoch Realm within a century!” Diao Yuanshan shook his head.

They communicated via mental senses, their exchange swift. As they spoke, the three saintly peak powerhouses’ attacks arrived instantly.

“I told you before. You really don’t take me seriously!” Diao Yuanshan’s eyes flashed with coldness. He didn’t reveal the three’s identities but struck his withered hand into the starry void.

“Boom…” The sea of stars churned. Though his purple hand seemed weak, it instantly neutralized the three’s attacks. Luo Tian remained untouched.

“Go!” The three saintly peak powerhouses in the void showed fear, knowing Diao Yuanshan might be furious. They grabbed four saintly heirs and tore through the void to escape.

“Fleeing won’t solve anything!” Diao Yuanshan’s aged voice echoed. His foot glowed purple, and he vanished from the spot. Even Luo Tian was stunned.

Chapter 1020: Return to the Fire Domain

At the entrance of the Demon Domain to the Fire Domain, Luo Tian stood still, exhaling deeply. His face bore a smile as he gazed at the sky, where thunderous roars echoed. Even Luo Tian could not see their movements.

Others also showed fear, staring at the void as vast starfields continuously exploded. Waves of suffocating pressure constantly emanated from the void, making people tremble.

“Rumors say Diao Yuanshan has entered the half-Epoch Realm. Now it’s confirmed! One man confronting three saintly peak powerhouses—such strength would be unmatched in the Nine Realms, except for a few living fossils. Few could match Diao Yuanshan’s strength!” The crowd murmured, watching the sky where blood from saintly peak powerhouses continuously fell. Even their holy blood made people shudder.

“Master, let them expel some of their essence. I have use for it!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the sky.

Gutianxiu needed essence to delay his life. Where else could he find such a rare elixir? It would definitely prolong Gutianxiu’s life!

“Good!” The sky only responded with Diao Yuanshan’s calm voice. Then it roared again.

“Diao Yuanshan, are you really going to finish us off? I am… Ah…” The voice didn’t finish before a pitiful scream echoed from the void. A drop of blue blood flew out, heading toward Luo Tian.

“Terrifying!” Luo Tian felt the immense power of the blue holy blood. Just one drop could pierce him completely.

“Take it!” Such terrifying blood couldn’t be contained in a regular vial. Luo Tian had no choice but to use the Spirit Transport Cauldron, opening its lid and catching the drop of blue holy blood.

As soon as Luo Tian collected the essence, another moment later, a crystalline arm flew from the void. After piercing through a continent, it was wrapped in purple energy and fully refined.

“Ah…” The battle lasted only a moment. Finally, a withered corpse flew from the void, lifeless and devoid of blood—evidently refined by someone. The withered skeleton scattered across the starry void.

“A saintly peak powerhouse has fallen!” People watched the crystalline skeleton, their faces finally showing fear.

“A saintly peak powerhouse! The most elite among the Nine Realms, a core member of major sects and clans. Yet he fell—because of a saintly heir who could only reach the early saintly peak!” People trembled, watching the skeleton fall.

Even in death, the saintly peak’s skeleton still pressed upon people with immense pressure. But it was merely pressure—vastly inferior to a living saintly peak.

People knew from now on, the Nine Realms would consider Diao Yuanshan’s backing before daring to touch Luo Tian. Only those sects capable of withstanding Diao Yuanshan’s wrath would dare to attack Luo Tian.

“Finding a saintly peak powerhouse’s bones can also refine top-tier saintly relics!” However, people soon showed greed. They guessed whose skeleton it was—since the other two clans’ ancestors were beasts, they would transform into their true forms even after death.

This human-shaped skeleton was clearly the one from the Thunder Domain’s saintly peak ancestor. People had no hesitation, rushing toward the skeleton and even starting a fight.

A pale figure of Li Tianyi appeared in the void, his eyes lifeless and trembling as he emerged into view.

Luo Tian’s face shifted. A saintly early peak, Diao Yuanshan wouldn’t even bother to fight—just threw him out.

“Your luck’s good. I won’t kill you, but I’ll imprison you. Perhaps there’s still use for you later!” Luo Tian smiled, drawing seals and sealing the Thunder Domain’s saintly heir. He placed him in the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. After all, the Spirit Transport Cauldron still held their Thunder Domain ancestor’s holy blood. He dared not place both together, unsure what might happen.

Accurately speaking, even the Thunder Domain’s ancestor hadn’t died. The holy blood in the Spirit Transport Cauldron could always revive him.

Luo Tian could seal ordinary things, but this saintly peak’s holy blood was beyond his current strength. He could only briefly seal it, waiting for Diao Yuanshan to resolve the situation and return to help.

The roaring continued. People kept fighting over the Thunder Domain’s ancestor’s bones. A saintly peak powerhouse had met such a fate, leaving Luo Tian contemplative.

“Go… If there’s another time, you know my temper!” Diao Yuanshan’s cold voice rose from the void. Instantly, the chaos ceased. Two sounds of breaking through the sky echoed as Diao Yuanshan appeared before people.

Seeing Diao Yuanshan, people naturally stopped fighting. Their faces bore reverence as they looked at him. Some still held crystalline bone sticks, gazing at Diao Yuanshan.

Diao Yuanshan ignored their reverent gazes. He approached Luo Tian, handing him three jade bottles.

“I don’t know what you need their holy blood for. I’ve already refined the old man’s holy blood, including three drops of heartblood. The two who escaped each left four drops!” Diao Yuanshan spoke calmly, his tone indifferent.

Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy. He opened the Spirit Transport Cauldron, letting the blue blood float out.

Diao Yuanshan naturally understood Luo Tian’s intent. He pointed his finger, releasing purple energy that flew into the blue holy blood. A green mist slowly emerged from the blood, wrapping around Diao Yuanshan’s finger before he crushed it.

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, taking the holy blood and addressing Diao Yuanshan.

“I’ve heard about your condition. Perhaps I have a way to restore you!” Diao Yuanshan smiled at Luo Tian.

“What!” Luo Tian was stunned. He had never expected even Diao Yuanshan, who hadn’t found a way to restore him using Meng Lingshao’s soul fragment, could have a solution.

“Don’t rush. I only have a slight chance. It’s just possible, so we can try. But it’ll take some time. Wait until Longzu’s bloodline awakens and becomes independent, then I’ll take you to the Dragon-Devouring Valley. It’s also when you need to pick the Immortal Life Bamboo!” Diao Yuanshan shook his head.

“Dragon-Devouring Valley!” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed. Now he had fully understood the Nine Realms.

Each realm contained a place of death, eternal and unchanging. Even in the era of Epoch Masters, legends spoke of several Epoch Masters entering the Nine Death Zones. Some found rare immortal metals to forge epoch relics, others discovered legendary medicinal herbs. There were even rumors that several Epoch Masters had perished within the Nine Death Zones.

The Dragon-Devouring Valley of the Demon Domain was one of these death zones. Luo Tian had also learned that the Four Sacred Star Realms’ death zone was the Broken God Cliff, which had terrified him. He secretly thanked himself for only reaching halfway up the mountain and not continuing.

The Fire Domain’s death zone was the barrier between the Fire Domain and the Four Sacred Star Realms’ fiery sea. Legends said that even Epoch Masters would be burned to ashes by the terrifying heat. When Luo Tian learned this, he was drenched in sweat—he had crossed the fiery sea to enter the Fire Domain.

Later, Zheng Xin and Gu Lei had used Wan Lingkong’s array to cross the void into the Fire Domain. At that time, Luo Tian had marveled at Wan Lingkong’s array mastery.

“Dragon-Devouring Valley?” Luo Tian’s face hardened. Whether for the Immortal Life Bamboo or this chance to break through the Heavenly Dao’s suppression, he would try.

“Master, I’ll first return to the Fire Domain and Four Sacred Star Realms to settle things. Once settled, I’ll come to the Demon Domain to join you in entering the Dragon-Devouring Valley!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Diao Yuanshan.

“Hmph. I can only send you this far. The Holy City’s side, Longzu’s place is tied up. The Eight Great Clans are stirring. I’ve been away too long; I fear something might happen to Longzu!” Diao Yuanshan spoke, his voice laced with coldness.

Luo Tian’s eyebrows twitched. He handed Diao Yuanshan the Dragon Emperor Seal and Killing Heaven Bow: “Long Jie’s place—please entrust it to you!”

Diao Yuanshan’s eyes showed approval. He took the Dragon Emperor Seal and returned the Killing Heaven Bow: “This bow is more useful for you. Once in the Fire Domain, I might not arrive quickly enough. Consider it a life-saving tool. Your friends have already left ahead of you! As for where they went, I don’t know!”

“Hmph. Then I’ll take my leave!” Luo Tian didn’t refuse. He truly needed the Killing Heaven Bow, slinging it over his back and heading toward the Fire Domain’s entrance.

Diao Yuanshan glanced at Luo Tian, confirming he had entered the Fire Domain. Under people’s trembling gazes, he vanished from the spot.

“Hah… The pressure of a half-Epoch Realm is too great. My heavens, even Master Diao Yuanshan didn’t release any pressure, but I still struggled to breathe!” People exhaled deeply, then continued fighting over the saintly peak’s bones.

Yet this battle spread throughout the Nine Realms. The death of a saintly peak powerhouse was a monumental event for any sect or clan. Luo Tian had finally ended this bloody journey.

Chapter 1021: Meeting Gutianxiu

In the Fire Domain, under a fiery starry sky, Luo Tian gazed at the familiar stars, smiling and exhaling deeply.

“Finally arrived!” Luo Tian looked into the starry void, recalling his bloody journey back from the Demon Domain. He had traversed countless corpses to return.

“Tired… I’ve finally reached my territory!” Luo Tian stretched, his body emitting thunderous sounds. His injuries had largely recovered. He changed into clean clothes, discarding the bloodstained ones and heading toward Tongtian Mountain.

“Ah… nothing has changed. I entered the Demon Domain as an early saintly peak, and now I’m still one. Damn it, I’m still under the Heavenly Dao’s suppression!” Luo Tian mused over his journey through the Demon Domain, feeling cheated. Though his combat power had improved by a level, being unable to cultivate was fatal for him.

“First see Gutianxiu. He must have a solution. After all, he’s been under the Heavenly Dao’s suppression for so long; he’s a veteran!” Luo Tian sighed, his body moving. He spread his vast spiritual sense—now he was a target, so someone might still seek trouble.

Luo Tian transformed into a meteor, flying at full speed. After four days, he reached the sky above Tongtian Mountain.

“I’m back!” Luo Tian smiled at the familiar Tongtian Mountain, shouting toward it.

“Who is it?” Two disciples of the Eight Source Immortals looked tense, gazing at Luo Tian and shouting back.

“Don’t recognize me?” Luo Tian smiled, watching the two guards who had gone on high alert. He wore a satisfied expression.

“Wang Xuanyang has done well; he manages Tongtian Sect so orderly!” Luo Tian watched as the two gatekeepers scolded, and immediately, an overlord-level elder flew out of the sect. His face bore tension as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Master Luo!” Two overlord-level elders saw Luo Tian and wore joy, shouting in surprise.

Their voices weren’t controlled. They echoed throughout Tongtian Sect, causing chaos immediately. Next moment, figures flashed in, familiar faces appearing before Luo Tian.

“Haha! I said Luo Tian would be fine!” A loud laugh echoed as Gu Lei and Zheng Xin appeared before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled at the figures, his heart relaxing slightly.

But as he relaxed, a crack suddenly appeared in the sky above Tongtian Mountain. A blood-red figure materialized before Luo Tian, stabbing toward his back.

Cold air instantly enveloped Luo Tian, filling his mind with death’s aura.

Luo Tian had fought countless battles. At the moment this cold air appeared, his body instinctively reacted, tensing and emitting waves of sound.

“Pfth…” The blood-red spear missed Luo Tian’s heart, instead piercing his shoulder. Blood splattered.

It retreated instantly, then the blood-red figure vanished through the void, disappearing from view at lightning speed.

Gu Lei and others were stunned. That blood-red figure was too fast; they would have been killed instantly.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Lei and others showed tension, looking at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s face paled slightly. His expression turned serious as he gazed at the void, wind rising beneath his feet before vanishing into it.

“Finally, they’ve struck. The Revenant Domain!” Luo Tian knew immediately where the blood-red figure came from.

Only someone who could bypass his spiritual sense and strike when he was vulnerable could do this. Such a method wasn’t achievable for an ordinary early saintly peak—anyone else would have been killed instantly.

“Too dangerous. The Revenant Domain’s people are too dangerous, like a venomous snake coiled around your back. If you relax even slightly, they’ll strike with a fatal blow!” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the blood-red figure disappearing from his spiritual sense.

Luo Tian didn’t chase. First, his body hadn’t fully recovered. Second, he didn’t know if the opponent had more ambushes.

“Ah… I need to think of a way,” Luo Tian frowned, his shoulder wound healed. He returned to Tongtian Sect.

Gu Lei and Zheng Xin were anxiously waiting for Luo Tian. Seeing him appear, they rushed forward, asking: “Luo Tian, who was that? Why is he so terrifying? Even you were wounded. His strength seems only early saintly peak!”

“Nothing, he escaped!” Luo Tian smiled and didn’t want them to worry. With their company, he entered Tongtian Mountain.

Wang Xuanyang recounted the current state of Tongtian Sect. It had now firmly become one of the three major sects in the Fire Domain, on good terms with Shanhai Pavilion and Lihuo Temple.

After Wang Xuanyang’s report, he led the elders away from the hall, leaving it for Luo Tian, Gu Lei, and others from the Four Sacred Star Realms.

Xu He Tianluo and Chen Zhanbiao went to explore together. Chen Zhanbiao was left by Diao Yuanshan in the Holy City, who said he could improve his strength.

The remaining people returned to the Fire Domain waiting for Luo Tian’s return. Only six remained now.

Luo Tian glanced at Nan Gong Yuching. Both had reached early saintly peak, fulfilling their initial agreement.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected to reach early saintly peak so quickly. It surprised him.

“Nan Gong Brother, I’ll take Gu Lei to meet Gutianxiu. Then we’ll return to Hu Lao Star and fetch the elder, going to the Divine Beast Domain!” Luo Tian smiled at Nan Gong Yuching.

“Finally returning to the Demon Clan?” Nan Gong Yuching and Li Tianzhi, along with Wan Lingkong, had gleaming eyes. Their expressions carried excitement.

Li Tianzhi was Nan Gong Yuching’s brother, naturally hoping for his return to the Demon Clan and restoring his father’s former glory. Wan Lingkong had now achieved a small mastery of arrays. If he deployed the Celestial Punishment Array, it could not kill saintly peak powerhouses but could definitely eliminate late saintly peaks. Among them, besides Luo Tian, Wan Lingkong was the most terrifying—provided he had time to set up the array.

“I still remember that terrifying chase!” Wan Lingkong smiled with a grim expression, recalling when he was hunted for not joining the Demon Clan.

“Alright, you all rest here. Gu Lei, I’ll take you to meet Gutianxiu!” Luo Tian frowned slightly at Gu Lei.

Luo Tian worried about Gutianxiu’s deadline. He urgently needed to deliver the holy blood of saintly peak powerhouses to Gutianxiu. Normally, Gu Lei would sense his arrival at Tongtian Mountain. Why hadn’t he appeared? Luo Tian felt a vague unease.

When he left the Fire Domain, Gutianxiu had said he had only a few years left. Now, having spent nearly two years in the Demon Domain, Gutianxiu should still be alive.

Gu Lei’s eyes showed excitement. He had heard of Gutianxiu before—Gutian Qing, the ancestor of the Gu Family. How could he not want to meet him?

But upon arriving at Tongtian Mountain, Gu Lei didn’t know where Gutianxiu was. Luo Tian had said Gutianxiu’s condition was poor, so he hadn’t rashly searched for him, fearing disturbing his meditation.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian grabbed Gu Lei and vanished from view. They instantly appeared beneath the dark ground, descending continuously until they reached the dark space where Luo Tian had first seen Gutianxiu.

Two years had passed. Gutianxiu looked even more emaciated, like a skeleton wrapped in skin. His eyes were closed, and weak breaths escaped his nose, making Luo Tian feel heartbroken.

Gu Lei’s heart pounded. He gazed at the withered old man, his face showing admiration. This was the ancestor of the Gu Family—once a legendary powerhouse, now reduced to this.

“Master!” Luo Tian’s voice trembled as he addressed Gutianxiu, speaking softly. He and Gu Lei knelt on the ground, waiting for Gutianxiu to open his eyes.

They remained respectfully kneeling. The space was eerily silent. After half a moment, Gutianxiu finally opened his eyes.

His murky eyes and withered face seemed ready to vanish at any moment. Seeing Luo Tian and Gu Lei, Gutianxiu’s aged voice echoed in their ears: “You’ve come.”

His weak voice made Luo Tian even more heartbroken. He quickly spoke: “Master, this is the Gu Family’s descendant—your youngest generation!”

“Gu Lei pays homage to Grandfather!” Gu Lei felt a lump in his throat, bowing three times.

“Rise. I can still endure for some time. No need for such reverence!” Gutianxiu smiled at Gu Lei and Luo Tian, speaking softly.

“Master, I have holy blood of saintly peak powerhouses and three sacred herbs. They can prolong your life!” Luo Tian stood up, handing the vial refined by Diao Yuanshan to Gutianxiu.

At the same time, Luo Tian waved his hand. Three rare sacred herbs appeared in his hands and were handed to Gutianxiu.

These were three sacred herbs taken by Meng Yunxiao from the Silk Cocoon of Heavenly Spiders, prepared for emergencies. They were all life-extending treasures.

Chapter 1022: A Solution

In the sealed space beneath Tongtian Mountain, thick vitality filled the underground. Three emerald sacred herbs floated there, making Gutianxiu’s expression show a hint of joy.

“Red Dragon Grass, Impermanence Wood, Blood Flame Flower!” Gutianxiu’s voice echoed. After being nourished by the intense vitality, his speech sounded stronger.

“You’ve had great fortune on this trip to the Demon Domain!” Gutianxiu smiled at Luo Tian, but his murky eyes narrowed. His withered body trembled.

“You’ve also been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao!” The entire space shook. Gutianxiu’s aged face turned grim, his eyes showing pity for Luo Tian.

Gu Lei’s face also changed. He hadn’t entered the Ancient Heaven Palace and didn’t know Luo Tian was suppressed by the Heavenly Dao. Even others in the Ancient Heaven Palace hadn’t known this news.

Later, they heard from Diao Yuanshan that Luo Tian had been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao. If he lacked opportunities, his life would be stuck at early saintly peak. They had been skeptical.
