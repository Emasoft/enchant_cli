After a hundred breaths, the group's barrier shattered with a thunderous crash. Yet many martial techniques still surged toward them. The Infernal Ghost Claw suddenly extended, striking the incoming attacks. Gu Qianxue and others also launched their assaults, another round of collisions erupting.

"Roar..." The barrier's collapse allowed the demon soldiers' flesh-and-blood might to charge forward, initiating a fresh wave of combat. Those who had previously unleashed martial techniques now recharged their attacks. The three thousand remaining demon soldiers also began to act, emitting a surging tide of black demonic energy that enveloped Luo Tian's group. Though it inflicted no tangible harm, the demon soldiers previously wounded by Luo Tian's group rapidly healed within the demonic aura.

"Damned, why are they more terrifying than a regular army!" Luo Tian's expression darkened as he continuously fought, clashing against the demon soldiers. Yet he knew this wasn't a sustainable strategy; eventually, these demons would kill him.

"Retreat to the previous hall!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, recalling the modest chamber that had only allowed two people to enter.

"There's none left!" Yin Xiu shouted, his body bearing wounds but glowing with green light as he instantly recovered.

"Buddha's compassion!" Jie Du chanted sutras, his body radiating divine light. Invulnerable to all techniques, he inflicted great damage on the demon soldiers but refrained from killing.

"Jie Du, what are you doing!" Luo Tian roared, watching another round of martial techniques and the domain of heavenly human law manifest. Black domains enveloped them.

In an instant, everyone formed a barrier again, retreating within it as the martial techniques roared.

"What if we're exhausted to death!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, watching Luo Tian uphold the barrier.

"Spit..." Luo Tian coughed up blood. This time, he only maintained it for ninety breaths.

"Give me a moment!" Luo Tian turned his body, sitting cross-legged behind the group. His hands moved swiftly, and a golden heart materialized in his grasp.

"What is this!" Seeing the golden heart, Zhou Zhiwen and others' expressions changed.

"Are they more numerous than us? I'll see who has the greater numbers!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his hands flowing with divine laws etched onto the golden heart.

"Thump..." Under Luo Tian's incitement, the golden heart emitted a heartbeat sound. This sound shook heaven and earth. The sound grew louder, heavy energy sweeping across the eight directions. The entire world seemed to tremble in rhythm with the heart's beat.

Golden divine light swept across, forming a golden barrier that enveloped them. No matter how the martial techniques and demon soldiers collided, they could not budge it.

The golden heart slowly rose from Luo Tian's hands. Intense divine light blazed, like the suns of myriad realms. Even Luo Tian's group had to squint their eyes, yet they could not discern the heart's true form. They only heard a more profound heartbeat.

A golden vortex appeared in Luo Tian's group's vision, and Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang of the Star Domain also saw this golden vortex rising in the starry sky.

"Bring out ten thousand True Immortals!" Luo Tian shouted at the golden vortex.

"Is that Luo Tian?" Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang had been waiting for Luo Tian to rescue them.

"Ten thousand True Immortals!" Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang's bodies paused slightly, then swiftly organized. Moments later, ten thousand True Immortals stood behind them.

"Go..." Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang's faces bore anticipation, fearing they might miss something. After all, the time flow between two worlds differed.

In an instant, ten thousand figures burst through the golden vortex, appearing in Luo Tian's group's vision. Each figure materialized, radiating powerful energy and standing before Luo Tian's group.

"What..." Zhou Zhiwen and others were utterly stunned, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian exhaled, the golden vortex vanishing as the golden heart returned to his grasp.

"What do you need us for?" Fuxingyue's eyes held amusement, rarely seeing Luo Tian in such a state.

"Stop talking nonsense. First deal with this immediate problem!" Luo Tian looked at the demon soldiers outside the golden barrier, addressing Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang.

At this moment, three half-step Immortal Kings' demon soldiers had appeared outside the barrier, continuously attacking the now dimming barrier.

"Good. But that's not how you address your brother-in-law!" Fuxingyue waved his Star Moon Divine Spear, addressing the ten thousand True Immortals behind him.

"This is the immortal realm. Everyone, fight!" Fuxingyue shouted loudly, his body moving as he rushed toward a half-step Immortal King's demon soldier.

"Yes!" The people behind Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang spoke in unison. Clearly, over the years, Fuxingyang and Fuxingyue hadn't slackened. Both had once commanded the Star Moon Guard and Star Yang Guard, proving their leadership skills.

Luo Tian extended his hand, retrieving the golden World Heart into his grasp. He let out a long breath.

"Fight..." Ten thousand people, perfectly coordinated, rushed toward the demon soldiers. Their strength and numbers far surpassed those of the demons.

"Take a break, I'll deal with the other half-step Immortal King!" Luo Tian addressed Zhou Zhiwen and others. Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang each met a half-step Immortal King's demon soldier, leaving one unattended. Only Luo Tian took the lead.

"Buzz..." The Demon Sword erupted, and Luo Tian merged with it, rushing toward the half-step Immortal King that continuously attacked.

"What other techniques do you have, Luo Xiong? We've never seen them!" Zhou Zhiwen's face showed admiration as he gazed at Luo Tian colliding with the half-step Immortal King.

Chapter 2326: Unleashing ()

"What was that golden heart? Why does it give me the feeling that if it bursts, everything here would be annihilated!" The silent Hun Xuan spoke.

"This aura... I've only felt it on our Medicine King Mountain's World Vessel!" Yin Xiu's face also bore admiration.

"Heart, the World Heart!" Jie Du softly sighed. The words made everyone's hearts tighten.

"How could it be? The World Heart is so rare, even the major Immortal Kings would have to act for it!" Yin Xiu's eyes immediately showed terror.

Gu Qianxue's gaze swept over the group, trying to see if they coveted the World Heart. After all, it was too precious; if it were known, it might prompt the Nine Great Mountains to secretly target Luo Tian.

"First deal with this immediate issue. We can't always let him do the heavy lifting!" Gu Qianxue coldly spoke, causing everyone to pause slightly. They suppressed the desire in their eyes and took flight, joining the battle.

"Boom..." A black demon sword collided with a black long spear. Luo Tian's body retreated, gazing at the black demon soldier charging toward him.

Heavenly Human Law... Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, enveloping the black demon soldier with Heavenly Human Law. Though the demon soldiers had no consciousness, their strength was terrifying; even Luo Tian had to be cautious.

The second level of the Sword Dao unfolded. The demon sword soared through the air, colliding repeatedly with the demon soldiers. Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang also continuously attacked, subduing the other two half-step Immortal King's demon soldiers. The battle turned one-sided.

Luo Tian wielded the Demon Sword, like a supreme demon king. His flesh-and-blood strength was formidable, constantly repelling the demon soldiers. His hands moved swiftly, unleashing the Infernal Ghost Claw toward the enemy.

"Roar..." The demon soldiers roared, shaking heaven and earth. The black long spear shook the heavens, colliding with the massive demon claw.

"Boom..." The black demon claw was shattered by the long spear, transforming into a tide of demonic energy that swept outward. The demon soldier's body moved like lightning, reappearing before Luo Tian, its long spear pressing downward.

"Skilled in flesh-and-blood?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. Since the battle began, the demon soldiers hadn't used any martial techniques. Luo Tian guessed this demon soldier, like other True Immortal demon soldiers, had three aspects: one skilled in martial techniques, one in flesh-and-blood strength, and one in regeneration.

"Crack..." A long sword soared through the air, colliding with the descending long spear. Luo Tian's body descended from the sky, instantly crushing a True Immortal mid-stage demon soldier. The ground cracked extensively.

"Has some skill!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his flesh-and-blood could match a half-step Immortal King. However, this demon soldier was evenly matched with Luo Tian, indicating the demon's flesh-and-blood strength was formidable.

"Ugh..." As everyone fought, a series of mournful cries echoed from the depths of Chen Tianxin's cave. The sound was piercing.

"Roar..." Hearing the piercing cries, the half-step Immortal King's demon soldier that fought Luo Tian trembled slightly before roaring fiercely. Its black long spear continuously fell, forming a storm of attacks that rushed toward Luo Tian.

Clang, clang... Luo Tian continuously swung the Demon Sword. Sparks rose from their surroundings; it was impossible to see the Demon Sword and black long spear clearly. However, Luo Tian's body continuously retreated, soon reaching the edge of the hall.

On another side, Fuxingyue and Fuxingyang's battles with the demon soldiers also became frenzied, their attacks fierce.

"Damn it, what's wrong with this thing!" Fuxingyue shouted, being suppressed by the demon soldier. A continuous stream of martial techniques made Fuxingyue dart around.

"I don't know!" Fuxingyang also faced a dilemma. This demon soldier seemed indestructible.

"Boom..." The black long spear shattered a courtyard. Luo Tian stepped on the Yellow Spring Steps, appearing one hundred feet away from the demon soldier. He panted heavily, wiped blood from his lips, and his hands, covered in cracks, moved swiftly. His body suddenly expanded to a thousand feet tall, and he stomped toward the demon soldier.

"Roar..." The demon soldier showed no fear. Its long spear was raised above its head, meeting Luo Tian's蛮七踏 (Fierce Seven Steps).

Boom, boom, boom... Four thunderous impacts. Luo Tian's four steps landed swiftly, giving the demon soldier no chance to resist. The earth trembled violently, and many buildings crumbled from sight.

"Still alive!" Luo Tian's eyes showed concern. His foot trembled violently, and the cracks spread under his feet. Shattered stones flew into the air.

A shockwave rose from Luo Tian's massive foot, causing his body to tremble. Finally, Luo Tian's foot could not withstand it; his body retreated. A black shadow burst from the earth.

The black shadow, like a meteor, appeared above Luo Tian. However, it had endured Luo Tian's combined attack of the Fierce Seven Steps. The demon soldier wasn't easy either; its black body was covered with cracks, and dark demonic energy seeped from the fissures.

"Go..." The Demon Sword swept across, striking the demon soldier. Another thunderous sound echoed as Luo Tian's body retreated, and the demon soldier also flew back.

"Roar..." The demon soldier growled. The dark energy continuously seeped from its body, forming a series of demonic patterns on the demon soldier's form.

Crack... Crack... The demon soldier's body began to grow rapidly, reaching nine hundred and ninety-nine feet. It matched Luo Tian in size, its aura even stronger.

"Whoosh..." A fierce wind rose above Luo Tian's head. The black spear shattered the void, smashing down toward Luo Tian.

"Open!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. The Demon Sword expanded into a sword of opening the heavens, colliding with the long spear. Heaven and earth collapsed; clouds and winds reversed. Two massive figures retreated again, but this time the demon soldier's long spear could not withstand Luo Tian's Demon Sword. It shattered with a thunderous crash.

"Roar..." The demon soldier roared, showing no concern. Its black fist became the weapon, charging toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian swung his sword again, striking the demon soldier's fist. Just as it was about to strike the fist, the demon soldier's fist rose black mist, transforming into black scales covering its fist.

"Crush..." The black fist collided with the sharp Demon Sword, but it remained unharmed. It caused Luo Tian's body to retreat.

"Is this true strength?" Luo Tian's eyes showed concern. He gazed at the demon soldier that shattered space, sending out four fist shadows.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed. Luo Tian's body retreated again, spitting out blood. His fist carried a series of divine patterns, and blood spilled in large quantities.

"Body Immortal King!" Luo Tian shouted. The fist's divine patterns caused blood to spill in large quantities.

"Damn it, how do I fight this!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. However, the black demon soldier gave him no chance to think, rushing forward again and striking Luo Tian with a fist.

If someone familiar with Luo Tian saw him so suppressed, they would be stunned. After all, Luo Tian's flesh-and-blood had never lost.

"Boom..." Another collision. Luo Tian spat out more blood, his massive body seemingly about to collapse, appearing ready to disintegrate.

"This isn't working. I'll be killed!" Luo Tian extended his hand, retrieving the震仙笔 (Zhenxian Brush) into his grasp. Eight black characters descended from the sky, pressing down on the demon soldier and halting its steps.

"Zhenxian Eight Styles. Now Luo Tian could fully master it, and the power was extremely strong. However, eight styles were all destroyed by three punches from the demon soldier.

"Only one move left!" Luo Tian收回 (retracted) the Zhenxian Brush, gazing at the demon soldier rushing toward him.

"Big Hei and Erhei, hold it for a while!" Luo Tian waved his hand. Two black dogs appeared before him.

"Roar..." The three-headed dog roared, instantly transforming into its massive form and rushing toward the demon soldier.

"Awo..." Erhei also wanted to act like the three-headed dog but only emitted a few whimpers. Its body remained the same size, yet it moved like lightning toward the demon soldier.

"Boom..." In an instant, the three-headed dog's massive body collided with the demon soldier. The three-headed dog flew back, its three heads spewing blood. Even with the three-headed dog's formidable flesh-and-blood strength, it couldn't withstand.

"Awo..." Erhei also appeared on the demon soldier's massive body. Compared to its size, it seemed like an ant. Its sharp teeth bit into the demon soldier's body, and a black mist flew out from the demon soldier, absorbed by Erhei's mouth. However, the wound didn't heal.

Lightning surged, black lightning descended, striking the demon soldier's body. Snowfall arrived, large ice blocks continuously smashing against the demon soldier.

The demon soldier roared, standing in the world. It was struck by a series of black lightning and ice blocks, its body constantly emitting demonic energy.

Luo Tian didn't care about the battle between Dahei and Erhei with the demon soldier. He knew these two would definitely hold it for a while, and this moment was enough for Luo Tian.

"That's the three-headed dog!" Gu Qianxue's eyes showed shock, gazing at the three-headed dog's robust body.

"Luo Tian is too strong. How does he have everything!" Yin Xiu and others continuously killed the demon soldiers but were again shocked by Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, and a series of demonic patterns flew from his hands, etched onto his body. His speed wasn't fast, but each time he etched a demonic pattern, his aura rose significantly. Luo Tian felt his blood seemed to be ignited, and his demonic energy was fully mobilized.

The technique he used was the Tianmo Dissolution (Heavenly Demon Dissolution). This was Luo Tian's first time using it on himself. He didn't want to move too fast, fearing he might explode from his own power. Thus, carefully, each hand sign flew from his hands, forming demonic patterns.

One... Ten...

After etching ten demonic patterns, Luo Tian's aura rose to its peak. His body's demonic energy seemed ready to ignite.

Chapter 2327: Erhei's Transformation

"Crack..." Luo Tian's aura continuously gathered. Finally, a crisp sound rose from his body, as if it couldn't withstand the demonic patterns' enhancement. His cultivation level surged to a half-step Immortal King, his flesh-and-blood covered with flowing demonic patterns, radiating an intense demonic aura.

"Limit! If I continue to use it, I'll explode!" Luo Tian's mind roared. A powerful feeling filled his entire body.

Luo Tian clenched his fists, eyes showing joy. He felt his strength and gazed at the demon soldier colliding with the three-headed dog, its black fist striking the three-headed dog's head, instantly sending it flying.

"Roar..." The demon soldier also roared. Its body was continuously bitten by Erhei, initially not much, but over time, it couldn't recover. This made the demon soldier painfully uncomfortable, its aura slightly decreasing.

"Now it's my turn!" Luo Tian's eyes showed coldness. He instantly appeared before the three-headed dog, punching forward and colliding with the demon soldier's fist that had rushed toward the three-headed dog.

"Boom..." This time, Luo Tian remained in place. The demon soldier's body crashed back, leaving black footprints on the ground.

"Come again!" Luo Tian shouted. His eyes showed joy. The Heavenly Demon Dissolution had nine hundred and ninety-nine hand signs. Luo Tian had only used over a hundred, yet he already possessed such strength.

"If I were a half-step Immortal King, with this Heavenly Demon Dissolution, I might be able to withstand an Immortal King!" Luo Tian thought. He took another step forward, his massive body seemingly heavy but moving swiftly. He instantly appeared before the demon soldier.

The demon soldier roared, as if insulted, continuously punching. It collided with Luo Tian again but was now suppressed.

Boom, boom, boom... The heavy sound echoed throughout the world. Luo Tian seemed like a demon god, while Erhei continuously devoured the demon soldier's body.

"Vanguard Five Steps!" Luo Tian growled, his foot stomped the ground. He instantly stood on top of the demon soldier's head. With one step, he combined with the Fierce Seven Steps and finally took the fifth step of the Fierce Seven Steps.

Five leg shadows, carrying overwhelming divine power, descended from the sky. Like a demon god descending, before his foot fell, a heavy pressure immediately descended upon the demon soldier's body.

"Ugh..." Erhei whimpered, quickly flying away from the demon soldier. Its black eyes showed fear.

"Roar..." The demon soldier seemed to sense a great danger, raising its hands toward the sky and roaring. Its aura gathered upward. When it reached its peak, that black mountain-like foot also descended, stepping on the demon soldier's raised hands. The sound of shaking heaven and earth echoed. The entire battlefield trembled, everyone's ears hearing a thunderous sound.

The power swept across, the area around Luo Tian and the demon soldier began to crumble. Smoke spread outward, obscuring Luo Tian and the demon soldier's massive bodies. The smoke moved, forming a gray mushroom cloud that rose into the air.

After dozens of breaths, Luo Tian and the demon soldier's figures appeared. Luo Tian stood near the demon soldier, while the demon soldier still maintained its hands raised toward the sky.

"Crack..." The massive body began to break apart, as if a building was collapsing. It transformed into thick demonic energy that spread outward.

"Ugh..." Just as the demon soldier disintegrated, a piercing scream echoed again from the cave's depths. The demon soldier crushed by Luo Tian transformed into black mist, drifting toward the cave's depth.

"Awo..." However, Erhei was somewhat unwilling. It kicked its leg and rushed toward the black mist. A powerful suction came from Erhei's mouth, starting to devour the thick demonic energy.

"Erhei... won't it be too much?" Luo Tian's mouth twitched, watching Erhei devouring the thick demonic energy. His heart tightened. Luo Tian was a demon cultivator, but he dared not devour so much demonic energy.

"Luo Tian, are you still looking? Come help me!" Just as Luo Tian was stunned, Fu Xingyue's shout echoed. It made Luo Tian regain his senses.

"Coming!" Luo Tian laughed, gazing at Fu Xingyue who was being hit and fleeing. He took flight, his powerful body directly colliding with the demon soldier Fu Xingyue was fighting.

"Buzz..." The demon soldier that fought Fu Xingyue saw Luo Tian rushing toward it. Its hands moved swiftly, astonishingly, this demon soldier had two hands separately forming seals. A black tower almost instantly formed in the demon soldier's left hand, while its right hand was a black long dragon.

The black tower descended from the sky, instantly falling on Luo Tian's head. The black long dragon followed closely, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Truly strong! Using one hand to form seals, and the speed of forming seals is even faster than a normal person's two hands!"

"Thus Fu Xingyue was so desperate!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration. He admired the three demon soldiers' strength, and these two techniques brought him considerable pressure. Each was a high-level technique of the Infernal Ghost Claw.

"However, I am stronger now!" Luo Tian's eyes showed confidence. His hands moved swiftly, the Infernal Ghost Claw descended from the sky toward the black long dragon. At the same time, Luo Tian punched forward, shattering space and colliding with the black tower.

"Boom..." Black scales emitted divine laws, covering the demon claws. The half-body of a beast was revealed but its true form remained unclear. However, the heavy aura made people feel suffocated. If it fully appeared, it would be earth-shattering.

The black demon claws directly exploded the black long dragon and didn't stop, rushing toward the demon soldier.

Boom... A distant sound echoed. The black tower collapsed on Luo Tian's head. Luo Tian took a step forward, rushing toward the demon soldier.

The demon soldier's hands moved again. However, a streak of light appeared behind it. The dazzling Star Moon Divine Spear broke through space, striking the demon soldier's back.

"Damn it, you forgot about me!" Fu Xingyue's figure appeared. He cursed and struck the demon soldier's back with his Star Moon Divine Spear. The demon soldier flew like a meteor, crashing into the ground.

Before it could get up, Luo Tian's powerful Fierce Seven Steps suddenly descended, pressing on the demon soldier's body. It immediately transformed into thick demonic energy.

"Awo..." Erhei joyfully cried, again devouring the demonic energy.

"One left!" Luo Tian gazed at the battlefield in ruins. At this time, Gu Qianxue and others were also entering the final stage.

Compared to Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue, Fu Xinyang's situation was much easier. Although the piercing cries echoed, his opponent's demon soldier also increased its strength. However, attacks and flesh-and-blood didn't improve much; only the terrifying regeneration speed had significantly increased. Thus, Fu Xinyang's attacks couldn't harm it, and the demon soldier also couldn't harm Fu Xinyang. One person and one demon soldier were stuck in this stalemate.

"Fight..." Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue both attacked simultaneously, rushing toward the demon soldier Fu Xinyang was fighting.

"Boom..." The Star Moon Divine Spear struck the demon soldier's body, instantly creating large cracks. However, it immediately recovered.

At the same time, Luo Tian's fist also struck the demon soldier's body. However, like Fu Xingyue's result, it immediately recovered.

"Can't kill unless one strike. This guy's regeneration ability is too变态!" Fu Xinyang spoke, clearly finding the demon soldier's weakness.

"One strike to kill. We three half-step Immortal Kings can't defeat this thing!" Fu Xingyue shouted, his Star Moon Divine Spear emitting ten thousand feet of brilliant light.

"It should be fine!" Luo Tian also nodded, taking a step forward. His hands moved swiftly, the Heavenly Human Law was used. This time it wasn't to suppress the opponent but to enhance their three strengths and auras.

"Start!" Fu Xinyang shouted loudly. The golden spear suddenly burst forth, echoing with Fu Xingyue's Star Moon Divine Spear. One Yang and one Moon. Luo Tian also took the fifth step of the Fierce Seven Steps.

Boom, boom, boom... Three thunderous sounds. The world changed colors. A wild gust of wind swept again. The sky began to collapse, and the ground started to tremble.

"How is it?" Luo Tian's three gathered together, watching the smoke gradually dissipate and the thick demonic energy. The smoke faded, black demonic energy floating in the air, making Luo Tian's three faces show joy.

However, their joy didn't last long. The thick demonic energy began to coalesce again, causing them to pause slightly.

"Damn it, can't even live?" Fu Xingyue couldn't help but curse. He flew forward again.

"Whoof..." However, Fu Xingyue hadn't even moved when a dog's bark echoed. A round black ball rushed ahead of Fu Xingyue, reaching the already somewhat formed black mist. It opened its mouth and sucked in the demonic energy.

"Will it explode?" Luo Tian watched Erhei sucking the demonic energy into his body, trembling. He felt this little creature might explode at any moment.

"Ugh..." Erhei was also in pain. Its feet could barely touch the ground, its round body looked like a meat ball.

"Awo..." Erhei whimpered, emitting painful sounds. This made Luo Tian's eyebrows furrow. He was about to take a step forward to check the situation, but the three-headed dog bit his robe with its three heads and shook them. The dog's barks continued, Erhei's continuous cries echoed, and a rumbling sound came from its round body. Its aura gradually rose. Erhei's body began to grow slowly.

"Two zhang... Ten zhang..." In an instant, Erhei's body grew to over ten zhang. As it grew, it became thinner.

Chapter 2328: Seven Lives of a Vengeful Infant

"Roar..." After growing to over ten zhang, Erhei suddenly roared. Its body continuously trembled, the sound carrying pain.

"Erhei!" Luo Tian shouted loudly but didn't approach. He knew Erhei might have undergone some change.

"Boom..." After roaring for an hour, the neck of Erhei cracked. A black head suddenly emerged from it, emitting a fierce demonic aura.

"The... second head!" Luo Tian's eyes showed joy. He hadn't expected Erhei to evolve. The black head emitted a series of black demonic energy, clearly different from Dahei's. It was a demon head.

"Roar..." Two heads roared toward the sky, then shrank back to Luo Tian's side. It looked around proudly in front of Luo Tian.

"Show off your strength!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of joy. He extended his hand, retrieving Dahei and Erhei.

At this moment, the other side of the battlefield was also completely resolved. Gu Qianxue and others stood there. Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang's people had suffered some losses but were still standing in formation, treating their injuries.

"Miss Gu, it's been a long time! Come call me second brother!" Fu Xingyue boasted to Gu Qianxue standing there.

"Go away..." However, a cold voice made Fu Xingyue slightly tremble. He looked at Luo Tian.

"She doesn't remember me!" Luo Tian didn't bother explaining to Fu Xingyue. He then looked at Zhou Zhiwen and others, his eyes showing a hint of joy.

"Luo Xiong, I won't reveal your possession of the World Heart. I can swear blood!" Zhou Zhiwen quickly spoke, beginning to swear.

"This... " Yin Xiu also hesitated but followed Zhou Zhiwen's example, beginning to swear blood.

Jie Du didn't hesitate. He had never desired the World Heart. Swearing was just to let Luo Tian feel at ease.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian returned to his normal size, his body emitting a sense of weakness. Clearly, the Heavenly Demon Dissolution wasn't easy to bear.

"Indeed, I shouldn't use it too much. Fortunately, I didn't chase after strength and continued to use it. If I had used a few more, I wouldn't just be standing here!" Luo Tian thought to himself. He looked at Zhou Zhiwen and others.

"Everyone, let's continue deeper?" Luo Tian gazed at the group who had sworn blood. He nodded in satisfaction and spoke to them.

"Um... Brother-in-law, shouldn't we send these people back first?" Fu Xingyue looked at Luo Tian, interrupting Luo Tian's words.

"Brother-in-law, second brother? Did he used to be my brother?" Gu Qianxue heard Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue's words, her mind confused but said nothing.

"This... " Luo Tian was stunned. The World Heart wasn't his, and Jiang Yichen had only given him the method to let people go. He hadn't told Luo Tian how to retrieve them.

"You're tricking me... so many people, how do we manage?" Fu Xinyang cursed impatiently.

At this time, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang had realized that Luo Tian's group was exploring a dangerous place. They would definitely continue deeper. If they let nearly ten thousand people follow, they might encounter some danger. In that case, these people might suffer heavy casualties.

These were Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang's old base. If they all perished, it would definitely break their hearts.

"Let these people stay here. When we come out, we'll go to the middle three days together!" Luo Tian spoke. There was no other way at this moment.

"Luo Xiong, I'll take responsibility for the transportation of these people!" Zhou Zhiwen's face showed a hint of joy. Luo Tian's display of strength and techniques since the beginning had made Zhou Zhiwen want to befriend him.

"You all, don't wander off. Stay here!" Fu Xingyue spoke to the group but then was still uneasy. He discussed with Fu Xinyang and left Fu Xinyang behind.

Luo Tian's group rested for a while, adjusting their states to peak condition. They knew that they might encounter more dangers ahead and needed to maintain good conditions.

"Let's go!" After resting for an hour, Luo Tian explained the situation to Fu Xingyue and then they stood up. Seven people walked toward the depths of Chen Tianxin's cave.

"You really are something, I guess it's necessary to come out. In the Star Domain, I felt there was nothing left to improve my strength!" Fu Xingyue's eyes showed admiration, following behind Luo Tian and others.

They passed through layers of dilapidated buildings. The deeper they went, the better preserved the structures were. They began to search each building for treasures.

"This sword is a middle-grade immortal artifact!"

"This is the Reverse Demon Pill! Taking it can enhance demonic energy's purity, briefly boosting strength. It suits Luo Xiong!"

As treasures and resources were collected by Luo Tian's group, they fell into their pockets.

"This is more like a cave. If there was nothing, it would be a disgrace to the name of the Mind Demon Elder!" Everyone's faces showed joy. They had gained much and felt that their previous suffering was worth it. The resources here were enough to compensate for half of the middle three days' sects.

They walked for an hour, no more buildings. They divided the resources and continued walking. Black stone roads, wet ground, cold air coming from afar. Black mist obscured the front, making it unclear how far ahead was.

"Front has buildings!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the front through the thick mist.

"Be careful. This time we don't know what strange things will appear!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, clearly the previous experience had made them cautious.

"Ugh..." A piercing baby's cry echoed in their ears, making Luo Tian's heart heavy. Previously, it was this crying that had increased the demon soldiers' strength. However, now they had reached here and didn't want to give up; it was just one step away from completing the entire cave.

They cautiously advanced. The crying grew louder, and the buildings Luo Tian saw became clearer.

Eight black stone pillars stood there. The ends of the pillars were invisible. They were engraved with complex seals. In the center stood a black altar, more terrifying was that a black vortex hovered above it, continuously pouring demonic energy.

"What is this? Also set by the Mind Demon Elder?" The group approached the altar, their confusion.

"This is!" However, as Luo Tian's group approached the altar, they saw a black stone on it. It was the much-anticipated幻魔石 (Huanmo Stone), and the crying came from it. However, this Huanmo Stone was dozens of times larger than the one on Gu Qianxue's necklace, nearly a foot long.

"Is this a single piece?" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, his eyes showing terror.

"Ugh..." As Luo Tian's group approached, the baby's crying became more urgent. Gu Qianxue's Huanmo Stone also responded, emitting a series of dark light.

"The two pieces of Huanmo Stone have感应 (sensations)." Gu Qianxue spoke, suppressing the Huanmo Stone.

Demonic energy continuously poured into the black Huanmo Stone. A terrifying aura was transmitted within it. The eight stone pillars extended eight black seal chains, binding the Huanmo Stone.

"There's something wrong!" Luo Tian and others felt an immediate sense of unease. They sensed this Huanmo Stone wasn't easy to obtain.

"This is the Eight Gates of Binding Ghosts!" Gu Qianxue identified the eight pillars and exclaimed.
