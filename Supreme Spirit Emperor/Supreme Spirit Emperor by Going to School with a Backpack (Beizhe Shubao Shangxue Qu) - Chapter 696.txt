“Is he truly at the late stage of Immortal King?” Luo Tian mused within himself, his gaze fixed upon Wang Duantian. He was well aware of Yijianren’s strength, a mid-stage Immortal King and the disciple of Huangtian Sect. Even if an advanced Immortal King had intervened, Yijianren would not have stood no chance at all.

Though he had prepared himself, Luo Tian was still startled by Wang Duantian’s presence. He had vaguely perceived Wang Duantian moving just now.

“This must be a supreme deity; we cannot let him leave!” Luo Tian resolved within himself, determined to detain Wang Duantian.

“Isn’t this the owner of Panlong Restaurant?” The people of Panlong City gazed with shock. They had never expected the unassuming Wang Duantian to be so formidable; they only knew he could catch silver dragon fish.

As the crowd marveled, the blood mist that had formed from Yijianren gradually emitted fluctuations, coalescing once more into his form.

“An immortal body?” Wang Duantian’s face bore a flicker of interest as he observed Yijianren, who dared not move.

“Boy, I know you can gather spiritual essences; bring me the remaining souls in this courtyard!” Wang Duantian addressed Luo Tian.

Chapter 2605: Wang Duantian Departs

On Panlong City’s streets, all hearts trembled. Yijianren was especially terrified; had it not been for his final use of the Yellow Spring Demon Seal, he would have already perished.

“Understood,” Luo Tian stepped forward into the courtyard, gazing upon its corpses and bloodstains. His eyes met Yijianren’s; even without Wang Duantian’s intervention, Luo Tian would act. This was a matter of great importance for Tianyuan Sect—Luo Tian sought to prove that Tianyuan possessed the strength and resolve to protect its domain, even this small Panlong City.

Luo Tian’s hands moved, sending invisible waves throughout the courtyard. With a hum, he unleashed spiritual laws, drawing in force from his hands.

Dust gradually drifted, coalescing before Luo Tian into one… ten… a hundred… over a hundred spiritual essences.

“Master, some have already entered the cycle of reincarnation; others were annihilated without a trace,” Luo Tian addressed Wang Duantian.

“City Governor’s residence had two hundred and nineteen people; now one hundred and seventy-three remain, forty-six dead,” Wang Duantian’s brow furrowed slightly as he pointed at Yijianren.

*Boom!*

Yijianren’s body shattered again, dissolving into blood mist upon the ground. This time, he did not recover; Huangtian Sect’s disciple was eradicated.

“One mid-stage Immortal King, and he is gone!” All gasped in terror, especially the hellish ghost cultivators who regarded Wang Duantian as a deity to be revered.

“Alas…” Jie Du wished to speak but fell silent.

Wang Duantian’s gaze swept over the spiritual essences gathered around Luo Tian, then waved his hand. The heavens trembled as celestial forces converged upon the essences, forming figures that landed before Luo Tian.

With a clatter, over a hundred people knelt before Luo Tian and Wang Duantian. They had felt true death.

“Rise,” Wang Duantian said, “I have dwelled here for centuries; it was fate. But now, our fate has ended.”

Wang Duantian’s hands traced intricate seals into the sky, etching them across Panlong City.

*Boom… boom… boom…*

The entire city quaked violently, with some areas cracking open as dense spiritual energy coalesced above Panlong City.

“Take care of yourselves,” Wang Duantian addressed the city’s people.

“These items, take them; they will save your lives once,” Wang Duantian sent more seals into the restaurant staff.

“Boy, the rest is yours; when the time comes, I shall return,” Wang Duantian turned to Luo Tian and Jie Du, speaking softly.

“Master, you need not leave; I assure you, no one here remembers your presence,” Luo Tian suspected Wang Duantian’s reluctance to stay stemmed from fear of recognition.

“No need,” Wang Duantian shook his head gently; if he wished to remain unnoticed, he could.

“Master, I have already inquired about Wang Wang’s situation; if I find him, how should I contact you?” Luo Tian persisted, knowing only one person could retain Wang Duantian.

Hearing this, Wang Duantian’s expression shifted slightly but he still declined: “I have a task to complete; I cannot stay long.”

“Doesn’t the master worry about Wang Wang’s safety?” Luo Tian persisted.

“My son is not so easily killed.”

“Boy, stop wasting your breath; you cannot hold me back,” Wang Duantian smiled confidently.

“Very well, then I shall bid you farewell,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, bowing to Wang Duantian.

“Going!” Wang Duantian strode forward with his fishing rod, heading beyond Panlong City. None dared move; all bore expressions of reverence.

Only when Wang Duantian vanished did the people dare to breathe, then turned their gaze toward Luo Tian.

“Alright, go about your business; the master has enhanced Panlong City—its cultivation speed is twice as fast elsewhere!”

“City Governor, if anything arises, you may contact me,” Luo Tian watched Wang Duantian depart, handing the city governor a token.

Wang Duantian left; Luo Tian would not linger in Panlong City either. His plan had always been to return, and he had no intention of harming the Huangtian Sect’s ghost cultivators, allowing them to depart.

The resurrected city governor bore reverence as Luo Tian and Jie Du left.

“Master Jiedu, what are your plans? Your foolish master still lingers within Tianyuan Sect; beg him to leave quickly!” Luo Tian and Jie Du walked the streets, addressing Jie Du.

Luo Tian’s称呼 of Jie Du had shifted from “bald monk” to “monk,” then now to “Master.”

“I don’t know; my century of worldly immersion has ended.”

“Perhaps I’ll return to Xumi Mountain. Though we do not enter the world, if hell attacks the Upper Heavens, we shall inevitably join.” Jie Du spoke softly as they walked toward Tianyuan Sect.

…

Under a darkened sky, Wang Duantian strode forward, each step spanning thousands of feet, his speed astonishing.

He appeared above Tianyuan Sect without notice; no one detected his presence.

*Hum…* Waves rose from Tianyuan Sect, forming a barrier that instantly enclosed the entire sect.

“Who!” As the barrier formed, Tianyuan Sect erupted in shouts, its disciples swiftly gathering.

“Excellent,” Wang Duantian murmured, gazing at Tianyuan Sect with satisfaction. He flicked his finger, and scriptural patterns rained down from the sky like golden rain.

“What is this!” The sect’s people gazed in horror at the descending patterns, which embedded themselves within ten thousand feet of Tianyuan Sect, vanishing.

Wang Duantian’s actions concluded; his form vanished as if he had never arrived, yet Tianyuan Sect’s people were in chaos.

The patterns vanished without trace, but no changes occurred.

“Who is it? Who!” Nan Gong Yuqing and others barked, scanning the sky with tension. This barrier was set by Wan Lingkong; if danger arose, it would rise automatically. Yet they saw nothing but the golden rain.

“This script is no ordinary thing; it contains the essence of the Dao. Who is behind this? If they intend to attack Tianyuan Sect, we are doomed!” Wan Lingkong spoke gravely.

Chapter 2606: Departure

The people of Tianyuan Sect gazed at where the patterns had fallen, their eyes wide with horror. They scanned the distance but saw no one—this was most terrifying.

“His strength surpasses mine!” Xiang Tianming spoke, his gaze heavy with concern; even he had detected no trace.

“Be on guard!” All of Tianyuan Sect tensed, entering combat readiness. This era was too sensitive.

Yet after an hour, no movement stirred; instead, two figures arrived—Luo Tian and Jie Du returning.

“Luo Tian!” People gasped, watching him approach with joy.

“You little bastard, finally returned!” Xiang Tianming cursed; he had been busy these past days.

After a flurry of punches and kicks, Luo Tian pleaded for mercy, smiling at the group.

“Diao Dezhu, was it you who led this!” Luo Tian cursed, kicking Diao Dezhu’s backside.

“No it wasn’t me!” Diao Dezhu shouted, his voice filled with anger, gazing at Luo Tian with resentment.

“Next time, I’ll beat Diao Dezhu!” Luo Tian resolved inwardly, then glanced at others.

“Why is it always me who gets hurt!” Diao Dezhu shouted, but no one responded.

“Are you greeting me?” Luo Tian’s face bore confusion; he did not understand why they had gathered so orderly.

“Someone powerful intervened!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, their expressions sobered; they recounted the events to him.

“Ah, I see. Alright, everyone return; there’s no major issue. I wish to know who it was—go about your tasks!” Luo Tian nodded, suspecting it was Wang Duantian’s doing. No one else could have acted so silently.

“Seems the master still cares for the Nine Realms!” Luo Tian mused, a smile on his face.

“By the way, you arrived just in time; hell has sent an envoy to negotiate!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s dismissal of the issue, they calmed down and addressed him.

“Who is it?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, recalling Yijianren.

“We don’t know yet; but you should recognize them. Tianyuan Sect is no small force—such an envoy would need proper weight!” Diao Dezhu’s face bore pride.

“Indeed, it must be a disciple from one of the halls,” Luo Tian nodded, joining them in the hall.

They all sat down, finally turning to Luo Tian: “What are your plans?”

“No specific plan; tell me your strategies instead!” Luo Tian knew they had planned more thoroughly than him, as he had spent the past two years fishing and refining himself.

“They need you to visit hell and communicate with the Wheel Turning Sect; ideally, also with other halls. If we establish Tianyuan Sect independently, it could become like the Eight Hell Kings but remain unbound by any hell hall!” Jiang Síxī spoke, their best plan.

“This requires you; you are the only one who understands hell thoroughly. Thus, this task falls to you alone—only you can fully represent Tianyuan Sect!” Jiang Síxī and the others gazed at Luo Tian.

“Negotiations?” Luo Tian frowned; he was not adept at such matters, yet he knew no one else suited the role. Moreover, the Wheel Turning Disc was still in his possession; if he returned it, Hei Bai Wu Chang would surely fight him.

“Alright, I do intend to visit hell!” Luo Tian nodded, gazing at them and accepting.

Hearing this, they showed no surprise; they knew Luo Tian would agree.

“Alright, let’s wait and see hell’s envoy’s attitude!” Jiang Síxī nodded.

“Also, don’t expect too much; hell’s envoy—Huangtian Sect’s disciple—has already died…” Just as they were delighted, Luo Tian’s words struck like cold water, leaving them stunned.

“Died… dead? How?” Instinctively, they turned their gazes to Luo Tian; they knew this was surely connected to him.

Luo Tian recounted Yijianren’s story in detail, but took responsibility for killing him.

“Truly…”

“They’re dead; no big deal. But this hell trip, you shouldn’t go!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Nan Gong Yuqing and others began to block him.

“No problem; a Huangtian Sect disciple can’t harm me. Unless the sect master himself intervenes!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with confidence.

“Alright, let’s eat; I’ve caught plenty of fish these years!” Luo Tian laughed, watching several figures approach the hall.

“Woof…” Two large black dogs rushed forward, fat as balls, making Luo Tian’s lips twitch.

“You…!” Luo Tian lightly patted the two dog heads, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao and the fat monk.

Chen Zhanbiao remained robust, but Luo Tian clearly felt his meat had thickened. The fool monk was even fatter, giving the impression he could squeeze oil from him.

“Boy, I heard you caught a lot of fish… give the master some to taste!” The fool monk opened his mouth, taking a drunken breath.

“Your meals must be so good!” Luo Tian sighed at the two men and dogs.

“Master, didn’t Master Wang tell you to abstain from alcohol? Why are you still drinking!” Jie Du hurriedly approached the fool monk, his gaze filled with anger.

“Back already!” The fool monk looked at Jie Du, his eyes showing joy; he sensed Jie Du’s transformation.

Luo Tian waved his hand, sending all the fish he had caught over the years to Chen Zhanbiao, addressing him: “Eat sparingly; they may be extinct!”

Wang Duantian left, and the Panlong Pool vanished with him—perhaps to protect the silver dragon fish.

“Got it!” Chen Zhanbiao happily took the fish, but as soon as he did, the fool monk approached: “Boy, split it evenly!”

“Go to hell…” Chen Zhanbiao immediately became alert, gazing at the fool monk. That night, they all dined together, discussing details; the next day, several figures flew from Tianyuan Sect toward the hell’s ghost gate.

Chapter 2607: Return to Hell

Hell, since the Ghost Gate fell, had become desolate; most forces had deployed to attack the heavens. Thus, hell now had many ghosts and ghost cultivators but far fewer than before.

Yet even so, the Ten Hell Kings did not leave hell; they knew the entire Yellow River was their foundation.

Black skies above, Luo Tian flew with two companions: a robust and tall figure—Chen Zhanbiao—and another in white robes, spotless, his bald head strikingly obvious.

Luo Tian’s wrist also bore a bracelet—Dahei and Erhei, though they had not been released.

Chen Zhanbiao followed Luo Tian for two reasons: to check if hell had anything edible and to stay with Luo Tian, as he hadn’t been by his side for a long time.

As for Jie Du, the fool monk had no idea why he was sent with Luo Tian—“training.” He left a single sentence: “If not me, who?” before leaving with Yao Chen. In Luo Tian’s view, the fool monk likely wanted to get rid of Jie Du.

Luo Tian sighed, gazing at hell; it was his fortune ground. Without hell, he would never have reached this level.

Time had changed; Luo Tian still remembered his first entry into hell as a novice immortal, and now he was an advanced Immortal King.

Flying under black skies, Luo Tian released his Immortal King’s aura to avoid trouble; no one dared bother the three.

Time passed slowly; a day remained until reaching Wheel Turning Sect. The trio stopped at a small city’s outskirts, intending to rest.

This city was familiar—Heiyun City, where Luo Tian had killed Chen Tiansheng with Zhang Menlie.

Heiyun City’s governor, Liu Cheng, had once been his subordinate; later, due to Luo Tian, Liu Cheng was transferred to a major city.

Now, Luo Tian didn’t know who Heiyun City’s governor was. Upon entering the city, his eyes narrowed slightly.

“Boring!” As they stepped through the gate, a familiar voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making his brow furrow.

Three figures approached two silhouettes cloaked in black; the one that caught Luo Tian’s attention was a middle-aged man, stocky and nearly as tall as Chen Zhanbiao.

The man’s head bore two horns, his mouth revealed two teeth at the corners—clearly not human but a ghost.

The black robes he wore were familiar; they belonged to Luo Sheng Tang.

“I’ve seen him somewhere before!” Luo Tian gazed at the man, while the two also saw Luo Tian and blinked in surprise.

Yet they did nothing, merely gazing at him like a passerby before heading toward the city’s edge.

“Friends!” But they tried to leave, and Luo Tian would not let them go easily; these two were definitely unstable factors. Moreover, he had glimpsed a fleeting killer intent from the horned man.

“Huh…” The two bodies stilled, slowly turning to gaze at Luo Tian with confusion.

“Excuse me; is this Heiyun City? How do I reach Governor Liu Cheng’s mansion?” Luo Tian smiled, addressing them as a passerby.

“Ah, go straight ahead; turn left after two streets!” The horned man replied.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian patted the man’s shoulder, then strode into Heiyun City.

“I’m certain I’ve met him before!” After brief contact, Luo Tian was more convinced he had seen this man. Jie Du and Chen Zhanbiao did not stop Luo Tian’s thoughts but gazed at Heiyun City, which was quiet and had some ghost cultivators and creatures. Yet they did not recognize the three as heavenly sect disciples but assumed them to be ghost cultivators, since they had held a yellow talisman from Zhang Chenglong and Sun Kelnian’s disciples since entering the heavenly realm.

“I remember!” As he walked, Luo Tian suddenly halted in the street’s center, his eyes flashing cold.

“Demon Lord!” Luo Tian gasped, recalling who the horned man was.

The Demon Lord had once outwitted Ye Liangchen and others in the heavenly ghost gate battlefield. He was a peak immortal, capable of battling half-step Immortal Kings on the demon mountain’s tectonic plates.

But later, he was ambushed by Zhang Ziping and others and escaped, vanishing without a trace. After so many years, Luo Tian had forgotten him; he only remembered after much thought.

At that time, the Demon Lord had wings and terrifying horns—completely different from his current human form.

“Go!” Luo Tian turned abruptly, rushing out of Heiyun City in an instant but found no trace of the Demon Lord.

“His strength was peak immortal back then; how high has he risen now? He must have recognized me!” Luo Tian mused.

“But this time, you won’t escape…” Luo Tian smiled, sending a wisp of gray mist from his fingertip.

“Bad news! Governor Liu Cheng was killed!” As the mist appeared, cries echoed through Heiyun City, making Luo Tian start.

“What’s going on? Liu Cheng was transferred to a major city; why is he back here?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He had said “Governor Liu Cheng” casually to test their reactions; if they knew Liu Cheng, they were regulars here. Otherwise, they would not have heard of him.

“After all, we had a connection; I’ll avenge this for you!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes filled with emotion.

*Hum…*

The mist flew from Luo Tian’s fingertip, heading into the distance. Without hesitation, he leapt skyward, chasing the mist’s direction.

“I didn’t expect this guy to join Luo Sheng Tang!” Luo Tian mused; he hadn’t held back, having marked the Demon Lord earlier. Thus, tracking was easy.

Jie Du and Chen Zhanbiao followed Luo Tian’s back, heading toward the Demon Lord.

…

Under black skies, two streaks of light flew for half an hour before stopping.

“Demon, why run so fast? With our strength, who do we need to fear?” The Demon Lord’s companion asked, confusion in his gaze.

“Because it’s Luo Tian!” The Demon Lord replied, making his companion startle.

Chapter 2608: Thoughts

“He’s too powerful; we can’t fight this Luo Tian!” The Demon Lord’s companion bore fear, yet he was relieved Luo Tian hadn’t recognized them. He had heard of Luo Tian’s victories.

“If I’m not mistaken, he must have recognized us!” But the Demon Lord’s words made his companion tense again.

“How? He never met me, and you’re different now!” The companion exclaimed.

“He once met me; we had a grudge, but it’s been too long—he may have forgotten. Leave quickly!” The Demon Lord spoke, his mind unsettled; Luo Tian was no longer the malleable Luo Tian he had known. He felt uneasy.

The Demon Lord and his companion checked their bodies for any marks, then took a breath before flying away.

As they left, three figures appeared on the hilltop where they had been, Luo Tian smiling.

“I’ll see where you run!” Luo Tian’s gray mist hovered before him, flying toward the Demon Lord.

Chasing and being chased, but the Demon Lord’s group didn’t notice Luo Tian and his companions.

Luo Tian’s trio moved swiftly, chasing for an hour before spotting the Demon Lord. Luo Tian’s vast spiritual awareness concealed them; the Demon Lord had no idea three killers followed.

On a black mountain, seemingly ordinary, the Demon Lord and his companion stopped, then took out a black token, which glowed with spiritual light.

Time twisted; two black whirlpools appeared before them, sucking the pair in.

“This is their base?” Luo Tian did not move but stood at a distance, watching the Demon Lord vanish.

“This is Wheel Turning Sect’s territory!” Luo Tian murmured, not daring to enter recklessly. He also did not let Chen Zhanbiao and Jie Du fight.

“He has my mark; they can’t escape. First, go to Wheel Turning Sect. I don’t know what strong forces are in this base; three of us entering recklessly might be dangerous. Better to find Wheel Turning Sect’s strength and catch them all at once.”

“What is Luo Sheng Tang?” Luo Tian mused, leading Jie Du and Chen Zhanbiao toward Wheel Turning Sect.

This time, Luo Tian had no leisure to wander; he headed straight for Wheel Turning Sect. A day later, he finally reached it.

“Disciple…” The gatekeepers blinked upon seeing him but still addressed Luo Tian.

“Hm,” Luo Tian nodded, leading Jie Du and Chen Zhanbiao into Wheel Turning Sect.

“Wait! Disciple, you may enter, but these heavenly sect disciples cannot!” Two gatekeepers gazed at Jie Du and Chen Zhanbiao.

“Hm?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly; he felt the gatekeepers’ attitude toward him had changed.

“Alas…” But Luo Tian sighed inwardly; he knew this was due to their resentment toward him.

“This is an eerily similar scene as before at Btian Mountain!” Luo Tian mused, gazing at Jie Du and Chen Zhanbiao.

“Wait here; I’ll return for you!” Luo Tian addressed them, stepping into Wheel Turning Sect.

Luo Tian’s arrival caused a stir in Wheel Turning Sect; many disciples glared at him with anger.

Luo Tian hadn’t taken two steps when several figures emerged before him.

“Ah, isn’t this the sect master of Tianyuan Sect? How did you find time to visit our humble Wheel Turning Sect?” An old man mocked, his voice sharp.

“Don’t be so harsh, Master Ming,” another old man spoke; it was Huo尊者 Yu Tian, who had returned from the heavenly realm.

“Almost there; this return must be to sever ties with Wheel Turning Sect!” The old man snorted.

“This guy was close to Yu Gui Tianzun back then!” Luo Tian observed the old man, Ming尊者 Junyangyu, one of Wheel Turning Sect’s eight great masters. He suspected that Junyangyu resented Luo Tian for exposing the traitor in Luo Shengmen.

“Or he might be a traitor himself; more than one person acted!” Luo Tian mused, scanning Junyangyu.

“Luo Tian, what business do you have with Wheel Turning Sect?” Jueying Tianzun spoke calmly but without his former gentleness.

“Come forward!” As they spoke, the voices of Hei Bai Wu Chang echoed in their ears, making them solemn.

Luo Tian smiled, joining the remaining masters as they walked toward the black hall.

They quickly reached Hei Bai Wu Chang’s location, where the two sat with no expression; their black and white eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

“Back?” After a pause, Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke.

“Yes, back,” Luo Tian replied simply.

“Leave?”

“Yes!” Hei Bai Wu Chang and Luo Tian exchanged questions, while the other masters remained silent, including Jueying Tianzun.

“What’s your plan?”

“I didn’t expect you to return; did you kill Huangtian Sect’s disciple? What plan do you have for me?” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s face finally grew solemn.

“Tianyuan Sect wishes independence and to negotiate with the other hall masters!” Luo Tian replied.

This made the hall’s people turn their gazes toward him.

“This is a request for the hall masters to act; I heard Huangtian Sect’s disciple, Yijianren, died in the heavenly realm—was it you?” Several masters murmured.

“I can summon them, but whether they come is their choice; how to negotiate is your business!” Hei Bai Wu Chang replied, sighing inwardly.

“Thank you for the favor,” Luo Tian waved his hand, sending a disc to Hei Bai Wu Chang.

“As for the Sinful Mirror, it has chosen its master; I regret I cannot return it!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying apology. Indeed, he felt indebted to Wheel Turning Sect; if not for necessity, he would not have left. But he knew Tianyuan Sect needed him more.

Chapter 2609: Meeting the Hall Master

Huangtian Sect, one of the Ten Hell Kings, had a poor atmosphere these days; Huangtian Sect’s disciple, Yijianren, was dead.

A mid-stage Immortal King, about to become a hall master, had died silently—this was an insult to Huangtian Sect.

“Tianyuan Sect, Luo Tian!” The Huangtian Sect master sat with a dark face; no one knew what he was thinking.

“It’s impossible; this Luo Tian is strong, but he couldn’t escape from him. Plus, he has many survival methods!” The Huangtian Sect master mused.

*Hum…*

As the Huangtian Sect master pondered, waves emanated from him.

“Hei Bai Wu Chang?” Sensing the waves, the Huangtian Sect master’s brow furrowed slightly before a sneer.

“I’ll see what explanation you have!” The Huangtian Sect master sneered, closing his eyes.

In the dark space, this was where the Ten Hell Kings had prepared for their attack on the heavenly realm. But since they had reached the heavenly core, this space hadn’t been visited for a long time.

Hei Bai Wu Chang sat there, waiting for other hall masters to arrive. Soon, several figures appeared in the space—Ten Hell Kings’ other hall masters.

“Hei Bai, what business do you have calling us?” Tianyu Old Ghost spoke, his eyes impatient.

The Huangtian Sect master bore a sneer, gazing at Hei Bai Wu Chang. Even if Hei Bai Wu Chang hadn’t called him, he would have sought an explanation; after all, Luo Tian was still a nominal Wheel Turning Sect disciple.

Hei Bai Wu Chang observed the hall masters; this time, not only did they come but also their disciples.

The disciples bore curiosity, gazing at this space from behind each hall master.

“Luo Tian has returned!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke calmly, surprised the hall masters had brought their disciples.

“This is to let them take over!” Hei Bai Wu Chang realized; these disciples had gained experience in the battle against the heavenly realm, so it was time to let them take over early.

Hearing Hei Bai Wu Chang’s words, the space’s people had varied expressions; they had heard of Yijianren’s death.

“Returning for what? Tianyuan Sect plans to submit?” Upon hearing Hei Bai Wu Chang’s words, the hall masters sneered; Tianyuan Sect was theirs to claim, and they wouldn’t let it slip under their noses.

“Let him speak for himself!” Hei Bai Wu Chang shook his head, then sat in the hall. Hei Bai Wu Chang grabbed Luo Tian toward himself.

Luo Tian felt his soul being pulled out by an unseen force, drawn in by a suction.

*Hum…*

Next moment, Luo Tian appeared in the dark space, seeing the Ten Hell Kings’ masters and disciples.

“Respect to all hall masters!” Luo Tian stood beside Hei Bai Wu Chang, bowing.

“What’s the matter?” Fengdu Master directly asked, giving Hei Bai Wu Chang a face.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve called you here to discuss Tianyuan Sect’s establishment!” Luo Tian addressed the hall masters.

“Speak your mind; either submit to one of the halls or dissolve, joining the Ten Halls. Alternatively, you may choose extinction!” A young man spoke, his voice strong—Yin Shen Sect’s Fan Tianyin.

Others said nothing; the hall masters remained silent, leaving it to their disciples.

“My intention is for Tianyuan Sect to become like the Eight Hell Kings, unbound by Ten Halls. However, if hell and heaven go to war, Tianyuan Sect will participate!” Luo Tian spoke calmly.

“Wake up; you think Tianyuan Sect is what?” Cheng Ping sneered; hell was currently dominant, and Tianyuan Sect was nothing to them.

“Of course, I can propose some conditions; the location of Luo Shengmen’s base, how about that?” Luo Tian spoke softly, knowing they wouldn’t easily concede. Thus, he presented his first condition.

“Luo Shengmen!” Upon hearing this, the disciples’ eyes flashed with hatred; in recent years, Luo Shengmen had been fierce, even hunting their disciples and nearly succeeding. Most of them had suffered injuries.

“Base?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the disciples’ faces bore tension.

“Are you certain?” Ye Qiu spoke coldly; even the hall masters’ faces were tense.

Luo Shengmen was too mysterious, and even they feared it; so far, they had only captured some Luo Shengmen members but no major targets.
