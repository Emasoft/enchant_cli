Two factions continuously gathered their final strength. One sought to withstand the apocalyptic attack, while the other aimed to annihilate several elders of the Demon Domain.

"One breath... three breaths..." Time flowed slowly, and in an instant, dozens of heartbeats had slipped away.

"Go!" Luo Tian's face was pale, his divine power ocean in the丹田 completely dried up. He ceased infusing the tortoise shell and raised his hands in a gesture of lifting heaven, dragging the humming black demon sun toward the Demon Emperor's Ancient Mirror.

"Must withstand it!" Several elders of the Demon Domain were frenzied, sweat streaming down their faces as they shouted.

The Demon Emperor's Ancient Mirror erupted with intense light under their combined efforts, illuminating the entire cosmos. A formidable barrier formed before them.

Under Luo Tian's expectant gaze, the black demon sun collided with the barrier radiating from the Demon Emperor's Ancient Mirror.

"Crack..." A thunderous roar echoed, and the cosmos trembled violently. Vast regions of space shattered, spreading for thousands of miles before ceasing.

Black qi churned, submerging the entire cosmos. A wild, formless wave swept over Luo Tian and his companions, pushing them thousands of feet away before they halted. Zheng Xin and Gu Lei's eyes were filled with terror.

"Thankfully, I moved the array's star chart earlier; otherwise, my efforts these days would have been in vain!" Wan Lingkong's eyes showed relief.

The array masters from various domains who had set up the teleportation阵 also nodded in agreement, their gazes toward Luo Tian now different.

As the black qi dissipated, people gradually regained their hearing. Their eyes turned toward the golden radiance still emanating from the Demon Emperor's Ancient Mirror, eager to see if it had been breached by such a devastating attack.

Under the curious glances, the Demon Emperor's Ancient Mirror emitted radiant light, its golden barrier riddled with dense cracks, as if on the verge of shattering.

"It hasn't broken!" Gu Lei and others exclaimed in disbelief, astonished that an Epoch Treasure had withstood the attack of a world-shattering tortoise shell.

"Even if it didn't touch, those inside must not be in good shape!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. He knew the terror of an Epoch Treasure; even his own ancient palace's defense could not be breached in the early epoch. Achieving this, Luo Tian felt satisfied.

As Luo Tian's words ended, people turned their attention to the barrier. Their faces then showed renewed shock.

Within the cracked barrier, blood qi swirled, and blood trickled through the fissures. No one stood within; everywhere was blood qi, a harrowing sight.

"Unfortunately, none died!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, gazing at the thick blood qi with a sigh.

The blood qi coalesced slowly into six elder figures, though their faces were pale and eyes filled with terror. Their cultivation had dropped to the late Saint stage.

"Resurrection through blood?" Zheng Xin's group showed a hint of joy. The elders' decline in cultivation was a great relief for them, as they were all at the late Saint stage. Facing these elders now weakened, they had no fear and confidence in leaving them here permanently.

"Are you not coming out yet?" Luo Tian smiled, taking out a pill and swallowing it to replenish his overexerted divine power. He spoke softly to the elders who had resurrected through blood.

"This!" The Demon Domain's elders were utterly terrified. With their cultivation dropped, their sense of security dwindled. To activate the Demon Emperor's Mirror required at least a late Saint stage; now, their collective decline left them unable to continue. They could only hope the Mirror would withstand Luo Tian's group's next assault, praying for Feng Clan's elder to arrive quickly. Otherwise, they might truly perish here today.

"Haha! Old dogs, take my strike!" Zheng Xin laughed wildly, raising a massive hammer and swinging it toward the shattered barrier.

"Finally, I can breathe easy!" Xu Liyi cursed, his golden hand swinging toward the barrier.

Long Jie and Wan Lingkong also simultaneously activated their martial arts, each strike echoing with thunderous force toward the seemingly shattered barrier.

"Damn thing!" The elders' faces darkened as they saw the disciples of the heavens unleashing their martial arts. They could only grit their teeth and push forward, using what remained of their divine power to counterattack Long Jie and Zheng Xin's assault.

Chapter 1175: The Rift of the Demon Domain

In the Fire Domain's cosmos, beneath the nearly shattered barrier of the Demon Emperor's Mirror, several Demon Domain Saint Ancestors gazed at the formidable martial arts attacks hurtling toward them. Their expressions darkened.

In their prime, they would have taken these attacks seriously. Long Jie and others were prodigies; facing Saint Ancestors at the peak of their cultivation, they could have fought evenly. Now, with the elders' cultivation dropped to late Saint stage, how could they withstand Long Jie's full-force assault?

Yet, the barrier of the Demon Emperor's Mirror still stood, though seemingly on the verge of breaking, it remained remarkably sturdy.

"Feng Dance Nine Heavens... Dragon's Battle in the Wild..." The elders channeled their remaining divine power through the barrier, attempting to halt Long Jie's advance.

"Boom..." Zheng Xin's massive hammer struck the barrier first, producing a deafening roar that made the barrier appear on the brink of collapse.

Before Zheng Xin's attack had finished echoing, a golden hand descended from the sky, slapping against the barrier—Xu Liyi's attack followed closely.

"Crack..." As the hand landed, the barrier—already on the verge of breaking—could no longer endure. It shattered with a thunderous explosion, scattering radiant light imbued with profound divine laws into people's sight.

"Broken!" Long Jie and others' faces lit up with joy. If the Emperor's barrier had fallen, those elders were merely meat on a plate. They were confident they could permanently leave these Saint Ancestors here.

The roaring continued without end, as Wan Lingkong and Chen Zhanbiao's attacks followed closely. Their clash with the six elders' martial arts made the latter's faces even paler.

"What to do?" The elders were utterly panicked, exchanging glances. Though they had repelled Zheng Xin's attack, it had cost them greatly. A sense of impending doom stirred within them.

"Die!" Long Jie's body shimmered with golden light, and he spat out an endless stream of imperial dragon qi. Nine true dragons formed, roaring with dragon power that circled his head like worshippers paying homage to their emperor. He directed them toward the six elders, striking with devastating force.

"Done for!" The six elders gazed at the nine true dragons, a death threat they hadn't faced in years. The despair instantly consumed their minds.

Now, the elders were cornered, facing nine dragons of imperial qi that seemed to crush them. They felt a wave of hopelessness.

"Roar..." Dragon power surged, and in an instant, the nine true dragons crashed into the elders.

But just as the dragons were about to crush the elders, a golden phoenix burst forth from the void. Its golden wings flapped, stirring endless winds and clouds as it descended into view.

The golden phoenix stood like a king before Liu Ming's Demon Domain Saint Ancestor, clashing with the nine imperial dragon qi. They collided and annihilated each other, creating waves of energy that swept across the cosmos.

"Feng Clan?" Long Jie's brow furrowed slightly, his gaze heavy as he looked toward the void from which the phoenix had emerged.

"Buzz..." The buzz echoed, and a powerful pressure swept over Luo Tian's group, making their minds snap alert. A strange fear arose within them.

The void split open, and a violent aura burst forth. Two elders with cold faces stepped out of the void, their eyes scanning Luo Tian's group before settling on him.

"Phoenix Ancestor!" The Demon Domain elders under the Demon Emperor's Mirror, severely wounded, showed joy upon seeing them. Earlier, Long Jie's attack had nearly driven them to despair; now, the Phoenix Ancestor had arrived at the crucial moment.

While examining Luo Tian's group, Luo Tian also observed the two elders. One he had met before—currently the Phoenix Ancestor—but the other, he hadn't seen. Yet, upon first seeing him, Luo Tian felt a deep unease.

The elder's body was hunched, emitting an aura of decay. His eye sockets were sunken, his appearance like a withered old man on the brink of death. This aura was familiar to Luo Tian, akin to the one from the two divine beings who had once sought to kill him.

"His name is Feng Changming! A powerhouse from the previous epoch!" Long Jie spoke softly, his eyes fixed on the elder beside the Phoenix Ancestor. His gaze turned to Luo Tian.

Hearing Long Jie's words, Luo Tian and his group's expressions darkened. Their eyes held shock as they gazed at the withered elder in the sky.

Feng Changming was a name Luo Tian's group had never heard of, but the term "previous epoch" alone conveyed his terrifying lineage.

"A peer of Master Meng Lingyun from the era of Ascending Heaven!" Luo Tian's lips twitched, his mind stunned by how long this being had existed.

"Is this the enemy you summoned to kill the Feng Clan?" Feng Changming's voice was hoarse, as if he hadn't spoken in a long time. He gazed at the six elders who had been beaten into submission by Luo Tian's group.

"You're truly useless—six of you defeated like this by a few juniors. If I had arrived even later, you'd have been annihilated. Truly disgraceful for the Demon Domain!" Feng Changming continued, scolding the six elders who dared not utter a word.

"Has this era changed?" The elder's gaze deepened, scanning the void and sensing a shift in the laws of heaven. His brow furrowed slightly.

"Little ones, come out. No need to hide anymore!" The elder's face showed disdain as he spoke into the void.

"Your esteemed status must not be so high that you'd take offense at us juniors," a hunched figure stepped out of the void, his purple robe marked with solemnity. Diaoyuanshan's face was grim as he stood beside Luo Tian's group.

Luo Tian and his group's lips twitched; such an old man being called "little one" was hard to accept.

"幽冥鬼貂 Clan?" Feng Changming's brow furrowed slightly, his gaze on Diaoyuanshan filled with scrutiny.

"Is the elder of the Yin Ming Gui Xiao Clan sealed or dead?" Feng Changming clearly knew about the Yin Ming Gui Xiao Clan.

"Yes, ancestor Diaoyuanshan has been in seclusion within our clan's ancestral grounds," Diaoyuanshan nodded, bowing respectfully to the elder.

"You may leave; these little ones are beyond your protection!" The Phoenix Ancestor clearly hesitated to involve Diaoyuanshan's clan, not wanting him to interfere.

"If I insist on protecting these little ones," Diaoyuanshan's face remained respectful, but his words were resolute.

"Ah, in my presence, do you think you have the ability to protect these little ones? If Diaoyuanshan hasn't emerged, with your own strength, what qualification do you have to speak so boldly before me?" The Phoenix Ancestor's gaze turned cold, his expression unkind.

"Whether I can protect them or not will be determined by trial!" Diaoyuanshan's face remained grim, his purple long sword appearing in his hand.

"Today's youth are so bold! Your ancestor Diaoyuanshan was the same, I must say. You Yin Ming Gui Xiao Clan are all audacious!" Feng Changming's face showed a hint of nostalgia, gazing at Diaoyuanshan.

At the same time, Feng Changming's face also turned cold; his time was limited. Since he had emerged, there was no hope of continuing life. He couldn't let this be in vain.

Thinking this, Feng Changming pointed his finger, and endless flames erupted from it, flying toward Diaoyuanshan.

"Near the end of the Yin Ming domain's chaos, we're fighting among ourselves, wasting the Demon Domain's strength. These are prodigies of the current era; losing one is a loss for nine domains. Forgive my impertinence!" Diaoyuanshan's face was grim, facing a mid-epoch powerhouse. He knew he had no chance of victory but still fought to protect Luo Tian's group.

Diaoyuanshan's body shimmered, his steps echoing the Yin Ming Gui Step, moving like teleportation. He vanished from the spot, evading.

"Yin Ming Gui Step of the Yin Ming Gui Clan is unparalleled in nine domains, renowned for speed. But you're still at the early epoch; even if I'm about to vanish, you won't be my match!" Feng Changming's face was cold, showing no regard for Diaoyuanshan's words. His ten fingers moved rapidly, and countless fire dragons erupted from his hands, attacking Diaoyuanshan.

Diaoyuanshan's face darkened upon seeing the endless fire dragons, his feet generating powerful waves as he dodged the fire dragons that seemed to cover the entire cosmos.

"Damn!" Diaoyuanshan cursed inwardly but knew Feng Changming wasn't seeking his life, merely to trap him. Otherwise, he wouldn't have withstood Feng Changming's attack.

The purple long sword erupted with a brilliant aura, expanding dramatically as Diaoyuanshan swung it. It severed numerous fire dragons but was still entangled by several, which contracted instantly, surrounding his body with powerful epoch power. Flames transformed into divine symbols that drifted around Diaoyuanshan's form.

"Buzz..." A sealing force resonated, and in the next moment, Diaoyuanshan was enveloped by flames, halting his rapid movement.

"Break!" Diaoyuanshan roared, his withered body unleashing infinite power. Divine symbols on his body shattered, transforming into swirling flames that drifted through the cosmos.

"This time is enough!" Feng Changming's face showed a hint of satisfaction, not stopping Diaoyuanshan from breaking free. Instead, he turned his gaze to Luo Tian's group. A crimson hand凝聚, an epoch power surpassing divine strength, bearing terrifying pressure as it crushed toward Luo Tian's group.

Chapter 1176: The Rise of Diaoyuanshan

Under the Fire Domain's cosmos, a crimson hand descended like a meteor, crushing the stars with apocalyptic force. It bore down on Luo Tian's group, who stood together.

"Done for! Oh no, we're about to be wiped out!" Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi's faces showed despair as they gazed at the overwhelming hand, shouting.

An attack from a mid-epoch powerhouse—neither they nor even early epoch power could withstand it.

Luo Tian's face was grim, his body feeling immense pressure, restricted in movement as if carrying a mountain. His breath became difficult.

Though Luo Tian was extraordinary, even facing half-epoch power he could fight. If an early epoch powerhouse wasn't too strong, he might have escaped. But against a mid-epoch power, there was truly no resistance—too great a gap in levels.

"Break!" Diaoyuanshan roared, purple qi filling the cosmos. His body's fire symbols shattered, and at the same time, he vanished from the spot, teleporting to stand beside Luo Tian's group.

The "Purple Qi Comes East" technique was activated, and Diaoyuanshan's face showed madness. A massive purple hand formed from the swirling qi, rushing toward Feng Changming's attack.

"Crack..." The next moment, the purple hand shattered violently. Diaoyuanshan spat blood, his gaze deep as he saw the crimson hand descend upon him.

"Block it!" By blocking, Feng Changming's attack weakened slightly but remained overwhelming, giving Luo Tian's group a brief reprieve.

Luo Tian quickly activated the Tortoise Shell Yin Fish, which rose above their heads, transforming into a black fish swimming through the cosmos. It rushed toward the crimson hand.

The hum of energy echoed, and though the black demon fish was small, its suction power was immense. Like a black hole, a vortex rose, absorbing the crimson hand into the fish's belly.

"Damn it!" The Yin Fish spirit cursed within the black space, its form dimmed. Even a skeleton forged by a mid-epoch powerhouse had cracks.

"Lo! You've met a mid-epoch powerhouse. What did you do to anger such a being? Mid-epoch power was top-tier in the era of the Divine and Demon Lords!" The Yin Fish spirit's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"I didn't do anything, just killed their clan's promising saint son!" Luo Tian conveyed through his spiritual sense.

"Damn it!" The Yin Fish spirit's lips twitched, but only the image did. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so bold as to kill a saint son destined for enlightenment.

"Though it's a bit of a risk, I like your approach. Enlightenment saint sons were also killed by the Divine and Demon Lords back then. Only those who are undefeated can eventually take that step. Kill well!" The Yin Fish spirit encouraged Luo Tian, his voice filled with encouragement.

"Don't talk nonsense! Is there a way to kill this mid-epoch power?" Luo Tian's mind was anxious, urging the spirit for a solution.

"No. If I and Yang Fish combined our strength to unleash two-thirds of the Divine and Demon Dao Map's power, this mid-epoch would be crushed. But now I'm alone; after blocking that attack, I've consumed much energy. I can withstand two more hits at most!" The Yin Fish spirit's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Damn it, you've been talking nonsense for so long with no help!" Luo Tian was speechless, cursing.

"No choice, kid. Enemies on the path to enlightenment are inevitable. The Divine and Demon Lords also had enemies they couldn't resist, but eventually achieved enlightenment. It takes more than strength; luck is also crucial!" The Yin Fish spirit encouraged Luo Tian.

"…" Luo Tian was speechless, not wanting to argue further with the spirit. His gaze returned to Feng Changming standing nearby.

"Lo! You killed my grandson Feng Jiutian, ending our clan's rise. Today, no one can save you!" The Phoenix Ancestor's face showed madness as he gazed at Luo Tian's group.

The other elders, who had nearly been annihilated by Luo Tian's group, also showed mockery, waiting for Feng Changming to strike and kill Luo Tian.

"A mid-epoch treasure! I didn't expect your fortune to be so great, obtaining half a mid-epoch treasure!" Feng Changming's eyes flickered with surprise before he sighed.

"Little fox, are you determined to oppose me? If you persist, I won't be kind and will also eliminate you!" Feng Changming stood high above. Though Luo Tian's group had half a mid-epoch treasure, it wasn't enough to threaten him. Plus, he had the Demon Emperor's Mirror, a true mid-epoch treasure.

"Respectful elder, take control of the Yin Fish and have a chance to protect us as we escape!" Luo Tian's face was grim, transmitting through his spiritual sense to Diaoyuanshan.

"No chance at all. You didn't see they still have the Demon Emperor's Mirror!" Diaoyuanshan replied, wiping his lips. His purple qi reappeared, and he gazed at Feng Changming preparing another attack with grim determination.

"Yes!" Diaoyuanshan's face showed resolve, gazing at Feng Changming. He regretted not summoning a clan elder from the Yin Ming Gui Clan; he hadn't expected Feng Changming's desire to kill Luo Tian so strongly that he had summoned the clan's elders.

"Good, since you insist on dying, I'll have no choice but to disregard the bond of one domain and kill you!" Feng Changming's face was cold.

A crimson hand凝聚 again, its power more terrifying than before. Even Diaoyuanshan felt a terrifying pressure; Feng Changming had decided to kill both him and Luo Tian.

"Respectful elder, take the Yin Fish and escape. When your strength grows, avenge us!" Luo Tian transmitted urgently to Diaoyuanshan.

"Stupid kid! My old bones aren't worth much. Today, I'll die here to protect you all!" Diaoyuanshan's eyes flashed with determination. His body emitted a thunderous roar, having made up his mind to fight to the end.

"Yin Ming Gui's Forbidden Art!" Diaoyuanshan pointed his finger, and purple qi surged. Strange symbols flowed into his body, causing his withered form to erupt in power. His cultivation soared rapidly, approaching mid-epoch within moments.

"Hmm?" Feng Changming's face changed, then showed a hint of seriousness as he observed Diaoyuanshan's power surge. A faint smile crossed his lips.

"Yin Ming Gui's Forbidden Art?" Feng Changming shook his head, gazing at the power-boosted Diaoyuanshan. He sighed softly.

"Come on!" Diaoyuanshan's aura had completely transformed, causing Luo Tian and his group to feel a bad premonition. The word "forbidden art" was like a taboo, akin to the Divine Lords' "Heavenly God's Nine Heavens," which reached ultimate ascension before vanishing.

"Go!" Diaoyuanshan's face showed madness, his current state not lasting long. He could only fight one last time to give Luo Tian's group a chance to escape.

"Not yet at mid-epoch, still not enough!" Feng Changming's face flashed with coldness. He too had limited time; each move drained him faster.

Diaoyuanshan's head floated with the Yin Fish Tortoise Shell, fearless as he charged toward Feng Changming. The Yin Fish Tortoise Shell transformed again into a small black fish, spewing dark qi to infuse into Diaoyuanshan's body.

Feng Changming didn't use the Demon Emperor's Mirror but fought with his bare hands, meeting Diaoyuanshan in a direct clash. Thunderous roars echoed through the cosmos as they clashed into the void, their speed so fast that even Luo Tian couldn't perceive their attacks.

"Lo! Should we escape?" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei's faces showed a hint of sorrow, knowing Diaoyuanshan was sacrificing his life to give them a chance.

"Can't escape!" Luo Tian shook his head, knowing they had nowhere to run. If Diaoyuanshan fell, even escaping to Tongtian Mountain would bring disaster; a mid-epoch powerhouse could annihilate all Fire Domain's strength.

"Since we can't escape, let's kill them all!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He gazed at the Demon Domain's elders, his killing intent rising as he moved toward Feng Changming's group.

"Damn it, one death is a profit!" Zheng Xin and others also moved toward the elders.

But just as they started moving, the void exploded, revealing two battered figures in their sight.

Diaoyuanshan's robe was bloodstained, his chest caved in, but his aura remained fierce. The Yin Fish Tortoise Shell flowed with dark light, repairing his wounds.

On the other side, Feng Changming was no better; both arms seemed torn off by force. His face was pale, eyes filled with shock.

"Unexpectedly, you're also astonishing. Given time, you'll surely reach mid-epoch. I didn't want to use the Demon Emperor's Mirror, but your half-mid-epoch treasure was troublesome. I'll end this quickly; my time is truly limited!" Feng Changming spoke softly, pointing his finger. The Demon Emperor's Mirror erupted with light, appearing above Feng Changming's head.

Chapter 1177: The Clash Between the Ancient Palace and the Demon Mirror

Under the cosmos of the Four Saints Domain, Feng Changming stood like a mountain, making Luo Tian's group feel short of breath.

His aged hands quickly recovered, and he waved his hand, causing radiant light to flash. The Demon Emperor's Mirror instantly appeared above Feng Changming's head.

"Demon Emperor's Mirror, the ultimate treasure of the Demon Domain. I never thought it would stain with the blood of the Demon Domain's people!" Feng Changming's face showed a hint of nostalgia as he pointed his finger, infusing endless flames into the Mirror.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed as the flames merged with the Mirror, causing it to vibrate. It seemed to awaken slowly, emitting a blinding light that made Luo Tian's group instinctively close their eyes. If they delayed longer, they felt their eyes would be blinded by the intense light.

"Hiss..." White smoke rose from Luo Tian's group, their flesh beginning to ascend as if being refined.

"I am also a Demon Domain person; naturally, I can activate the Demon Emperor's Mirror!" Diaoyuanshan sneered, waving his hand. Purple qi dispersed, protecting Luo Tian's group while most of it transformed into divine symbols and was infused into the Demon Emperor's Mirror.

"But you're still a junior; how could you be as familiar with the Demon Emperor's Mirror as I am?" Feng Changming smiled, waving his hand. The Mirror trembled again.

"This!" Diaoyuanshan's face showed shock, his expression filled with disbelief. His perception of the purple epoch power he had infused into the Mirror felt like a cow entering the sea, losing all contact. He couldn't control it.

"Go! It's over!" Feng Changming spoke softly, his voice cold. His patience had reached its limit.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The Demon Emperor's Mirror expanded violently, enveloping everyone in its light.

In the next moment, flames roared, pale fire erupting from the Mirror, carrying extreme refining power. It instantly covered the space around the Mirror.

"Damn it!" Diaoyuanshan's face turned grim, leaping into the air and activating his black Yin Fish Tortoise Shell to stand before Luo Tian's group.

The black shell exhaled a vast aura of dark light, shielding Luo Tian and his companions from the terrifying flames.

"Ah..." Gu Lei and Zheng Xin took deep breaths, even Luo Tian and Long Jie were no exception. Their eyes showed fear as they gazed at the terrifying flames outside the shell's protection.

"This fire is far stronger than the black fire we encountered in the depths of the Fire Domain!" Just a brief contact had made Luo Tian feel its terror. His entire body was being refined by the terrifying temperature.

"Enhanced by the Demon Emperor's Mirror, Feng Changming's innate fire has reached a terrifying level!" Diaoyuanshan's face showed grimness as he spoke to Luo Tian's group.

"Done for! I can't last long either. This fire is too damn terrifying; I feel like I'm about to be refined!" The Yin Fish spirit's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind again.

Luo Tian was also anxious, pondering how to deal with this terrifying fire. But then he felt something, his mind stirred, and his eyes showed a hint of anticipation.

"Our reinforcements have arrived!" Luo Tian spoke to the group, making their eyes light up.

"Ancestral Palace!" Their hearts rose with hope. They naturally knew Luo Tian could still summon the Ancestral Palace, a true mid-epoch treasure.

"Diaoyuanshan? Are you desperate?" Feng Changming's face showed mockery, gazing at the group. "This is what happens when you oppose my Feng Clan. How did the Dragon Clan fare? They ultimately declined!"

Hearing Feng Changming's words, Long Jie's face darkened. The Phoenix Ancestor's words felt like a sharp spear piercing his heart. His mockery of the Dragon Clan made Long Jie's face turn cold.

"Ha! If it weren't for your scheming, the Dragon Domain's master would not have bled. You think you've kept it secret from the Demon Domain? But how could you keep it hidden from me?" Diaoyuanshan's face showed a cold smile, gazing at Long Jie as if looking at a fool. The Dragon Clan had declined so much over the years, losing even their pride.

"Know it or not, what's the use? Today you'll die! When we return to the Demon Domain, I'll deal with your useless grandson. What can you do?" Feng Changming's face showed coldness, his expression revealing a sinister grin.

"You killed the Dragon Clan?" Feng Changming turned to face the Phoenix Ancestor, his gaze sharp with scrutiny.

"We didn't act; it was that dragon who was foolish and fell into the Yin Ming's trap!" The Phoenix Ancestor showed a hint of respect, speaking to Feng Changming.

"If you hadn't leaked information to the Yin Ming, would the Dragon Clan's master have been ambushed?" Diaoyuanshan stood in the fire, confronting the Phoenix Ancestor.

"The Eight Clans of the Demon Domain must not turn on each other. I never thought our sealed years would lead to this!" Feng Changming's face showed a hint of sorrow, shaking his head.

"Grand Elder, the Feng Clan's rise is unstoppable!" The Phoenix Ancestor showed respect, speaking to Feng Changming.

"Enough. I'm about to vanish anyway; do as you wish!" Feng Changming shook his head, a bittersweet feeling in his heart. The eight great clans now were far different from their time.

Long Jie's face darkened, standing beside the elders. The group had默契 to surround Long Jie, their eyes cold. Since the Phoenix Ancestor had spoken openly, they clearly decided to attack Long Jie.

"You!" Long Jie gazed at the elders surrounding him, speechless and his gaze deeper.

"Old fool, look! This is what happens when you've always protected these clans. In the end, they bit you!" Long Jie stood under the Tortoise Shell's protection, his eyes filled with mockery as he spoke to Long Jie.

"My mistake. To ensure the Dragon Clan's survival and the harmony of the eight great clans, I've endured until now!" Long Jie's face showed a hint of despair, sighing softly.

"Dragon elder, don't worry. That kid Long Jie will be ahead of you. After all, we've had years of friendship!" The Phoenix Ancestor smiled, gazing at Long Jie and the others whose blood boiled. Even Diaoyuanshan was sweating profusely.

The black Yin Fish Tortoise Shell hovering above their heads seemed to struggle, its dark light gradually dimming.

"Can't last long!" Diaoyuanshan gazed at the void, his face filled with worry.

"Finally over! Luo Tian, the invincible prodigy, the powerful reincarnation body that stirred chaos in nine domains. Today you'll perish, vanishing into dust!" The Phoenix Ancestor's group showed excitement; Luo Tian had pressed them too hard.

"Not over yet!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, his tension easing as he gazed at the void. A golden light reflected from the void, shining onto the Demon Emperor's Mirror above their heads.

"Boom... Boom..." A heavy roar echoed, and the golden palace collapsed vast voids, descending from the void.

"Crack..." The next moment, the golden palace collided with the Demon Emperor's Mirror.

Both were true mid-epoch treasures; their collision sent waves that even Diaoyuanshan struggled to withstand, his face pale as he desperately protected Luo Tian's group.

As the Ancestral Palace clashed with the Demon Emperor's Mirror, the pale fire spewing from the Mirror also exploded violently, transforming into waves of fire that spread outward.

Diaoyuanshan and Luo Tian's group seized the opportunity to escape from the Mirror's range, appearing thousands of feet away. Their gazes were grim as they looked at Feng Changming.

"Another mid-epoch treasure!" Seeing the Ancestral Palace, even Feng Changming's mind trembled with surprise. His gaze showed a hint of seriousness, but when he saw the calm figure stepping out from the void, his mind settled.

"Ancestral Palace! Who is Meng Lingyun to you?" Feng Changming's face changed, gazing at the golden palace as it stepped out from the void toward Jiang Nanxuan.

"This Ancestral Palace's master isn't me; it's him!" Jiang Nanxuan stood beside Luo Tian, and at the same time, the Ancestral Palace returned to their heads, replacing the Yin Fish Tortoise Shell.
