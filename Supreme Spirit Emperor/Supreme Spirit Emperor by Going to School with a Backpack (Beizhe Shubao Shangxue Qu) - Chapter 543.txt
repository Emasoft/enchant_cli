"Yet I never anticipated your ingratitude. Simply remain as your useless self, and perhaps you could barely endure," Luo Bai's aura gradually rose, his white robe fluttering as he gazed upon Luo Tian.

"All that you possess now is my gift, but today I reclaim it!" Luo Bai shouted loudly.

"Senior Brother Luo Bai, is this about confronting Luo Chen?" The people's faces shifted in expression.

"Senior Brother Luo Bai has always been so kind to Luo Chen. Why would he oppose Senior Brother Luo Bai?"

"Indeed, without Senior Brother Luo Bai's protection, he would have fared worse than a dog. Now that he has strength, he starts to act superior!" The unaware onlookers glared at Luo Tian with anger.

"If it weren't for my brother, I wouldn't be where I am today. My Ghost Pulse was taken, my Feeding Ghost Pills confiscated, and even a True Immortal Intermediate was sent to kill me. My brother's kindness is unparalleled!" Luo Tian laughed, his gaze upon Luo Bai, his words causing astonishment among the crowd.

"Scum. I should have killed you back then!" Duan Peizhen's face twisted in grotesque fury.

"What?"

"Was the Ghost Pulse originally Luo Chen's? Did Senior Brother Luo Bai extract it?" All faces bore disbelief, their gazes turning to Luo Bai.

"How did he discover this?" Not only the Luo family disciples were shaken, but even the high-ranking elders in the sky bore shock.

"Trouble is coming!" In an instant, all within the Luo family felt this thought rise in their hearts.

"If it's true, then Luo Tian's reaction is understandable," people mused, ceasing further discussion as they could not discern truth from falsehood between the two.

"Luo Tian, I challenge Luo Bai to a duel!" Luo Tian shouted, his gaze upon Luo Bai as battle fervor surged within him.

"Let us fight. There will be a clash eventually, better it come sooner," Luo Bai spoke softly, his battle spirit rising gradually.

"Agreed!" Luo Chengyang nodded. Luo Tian had defeated Luo Hu, and since Luo Hu's strength was nearly equal to Luo Long's, there was no need for further contest.

"Boom..." As soon as Luo Chengyang's words fell, a thunderous explosion echoed in the ears of all.

Luo Tian and Luo Bai appeared on the same arena, both breathing heavily.

"Did they just clash? So fast!" All eyes bore disbelief as they watched Luo Bai and Luo Tian.

"Indeed, my dear younger brother. You've hidden so long, even giving me your Feeding Ghost Pills!" Luo Bai's face remained calm as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Yet, before me, you'll still have to grovel like a dog!" Luo Bai spoke again, his hands moving swiftly. A crackling sound echoed from his body as his aura rose once more, causing murmurs among the crowd.

"Boom boom boom..." The continuous explosions saw Luo Bai's aura stabilize at True Immortal Intermediate.

"True Immortal Intermediate!"

"This cultivation speed is astonishing. No wonder the Ghost Pulse accelerates progress!" As Luo Bai reached True Immortal Intermediate, people gasped, their eyes filled with awe as they regarded him like a prodigy.

"My dear younger brother, what do you have now to fight me?" Luo Bai's form flashed like lightning, rushing toward Luo Tian while delivering a palm strike.

"This is your reliance? Then you may die!" Luo Tian's face showed no emotion. At this moment, he ceased concealing himself, his sealed power shattering as his True Immortal Initial strength erupted. A terrifying suppression radiated outward, instantly enveloping the charging Luo Bai.

The aura of an Ultimate Immortal momentarily halted Luo Bai's movement, his cultivation slowed by about a third.

"This!" Before Luo Bai could ponder further, Luo Tian's form had already arrived before him. A punch with threefold physical strength struck Luo Bai, sending him hurtling toward the arena's edge.

"Dead!" Luo Bai's face darkened. He had assumed his True Immortal Intermediate strength would easily crush Luo Tian, a half-step True Immortal. Yet this punch compelled even him to fight at full strength.

Black energy enveloped Luo Bai's fist as it clashed with Luo Tian's. A crisp sound echoed, both men retreating to the arena's edge.

"Even match!" The crowd murmured, their gazes upon Luo Tian in astonishment. They hadn't expected him to withstand Luo Bai's strike without falling behind.

"Luo Chen has also been concealing his strength. His true cultivation is True Immortal Initial!"

"Though he struck first, the fact that he forced Senior Brother Luo Bai to retreat is enough to prove his strength surpasses other True Immortal Initials!" People whispered among themselves.

In the Luo family, Luo Bai was a symbol of prestige. In the younger generation, he was nearly invincible. Even geniuses from other families would not face him so easily.

"Now it's my turn!" Luo Bai's eyes flickered with surprise. His hands moved, summoning nine black dragons from his grasp. Terrifying fluctuations radiated from his palms, and in an instant, eight black dragons coiled above the sky before transforming into Luo Bai's form. With his true self, nine figures charged toward Luo Tian.

"Nine Illusory Bodies! This is Senior Brother Luo Bai's signature technique. He must be aiming to swiftly subdue Luo Chen and preserve his reputation!" The crowd immediately recognized Luo Bai's method.

Faced with the nine figures rushing toward him, Luo Tian struggled to discern which was genuine.

"Then I'll treat them all as real!" A smile graced Luo Tian's face. He planted his foot, activating the Sealing King's Combat Technique with extraordinary battle experience to counter the nine figures.

"Boom..." Luo Tian delivered a punch, striking one of Luo Bai's forms. It exploded into black mist, vanishing beneath his fist.

"I'm here!" A cold voice echoed from all directions as the remaining seven figures attacked Luo Tian simultaneously.

"Dragon's Unyielding Form!" Luo Tian roared, black dragons coiling around his body. The dragons were formed from countless punches.

"Boom... Boom..." Six explosions echoed as six black mists burst before Luo Tian, who retreated again.

Chapter 2079: Unleashing Techniques

"Skillful techniques..." Luo Tian wiped his lips, observing the black mists reconstituting into Luo Bai's form.

"There are more techniques yet!" Nine Luo Bais spoke in unison, dividing into three groups to surround Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The nine figures radiated fluctuations. Three black whirlwinds rose in three directions, distorting space and launching toward Luo Tian with combined force.

The heavens trembled as the three whirlwinds descended upon Luo Tian's head. Wind howled around him, blowing his black robe violently.

"Sealing Heaven's Seal!" Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly. Black whirlwinds rose in the heavens, and a black seal descended from the sky.

"Divine King's Nine Heavens Map!" A black divine map burst forth from Luo Tian's hands, two rarely used martial arts striking the three whirlwinds.

"Overconfidence. Is this your technique? Not even a True Immortal-level skill!" Luo Bai observed Luo Tian's techniques, which were grand in scale but pale compared to his own.

In an instant, no collision sound. The Divine King's Nine Heavens Map and Sealing Heaven's Seal were annihilated by the three whirlwinds.

"Skillful techniques indeed..." Luo Tian's eyes gleamed, sensing a formidable challenge. His True Immortal-level skills were limited.

"Manifesting the World!"

"Barbarian God's Battle Chant!" Luo Tian formed a hand seal, his body exploding in size to thousands of feet. Barbarian patterns covered his body.

"What martial art is this!" All in Hell gasped, gazing at the giant Luo Tian.

"Who cares what technique it is. One punch to destroy it!" Luo Tian roared, swinging his massive fist with threefold physical strength.

This was the first time Luo Tian had unleashed a punch at True Immortal level. The combined effects of Manifesting the World and Barbarian God's Battle Chant had made his body extraordinary.

Plus, the insights from the Wild Wind Hammer Technique's threefold physical strength, Luo Tian was confident this punch could crush any True Immortal Initial, injure a True Immortal Intermediate, and even dare to challenge a True Immortal Advanced just through physical strength.

The black fist shattered the void, colliding with the first whirlwind. That whirlwind which had annihilated Sealing Heaven's Seal was shattered by Luo Tian's punch, bursting into wind that swept outward.

The second whirlwind followed swiftly but was also shattered by Luo Tian. After three booms, the three whirlwinds created by Luo Bai vanished from sight.

Blood spilled. Luo Tian's fist bore blood, and his thick arm was marked with cracks.

"It's my turn!" Luo Tian stood amidst the heavens, shouting loudly. His voice echoed through the Luo family as he took a step forward, stomping toward Luo Bai.

"My goodness, I've never seen someone grow so large before!" The Luo family trembled, especially the younger generation. Facing this state of Luo Tian, they felt a sense of reverence.

"Is this the true Luo Chen?" Almost everyone's hearts bore this thought.

Those who had previously bullied Luo Chen trembled, silently praying he wouldn't retaliate later.

"Damn, so fierce! I once thought of breaking his legs..." Luo Hong stood among the crowd, seeing Luo Hu's pitiful state. His heart was in turmoil.

Black feet fell repeatedly, each step shattering a black figure into swirling mist.

After seven steps, only two figures remained: Luo Bai's true self and a fake.

"Enough!" Luo Tian chuckled, his body returning to normal size. He then stomped toward Luo Bai.

Another punch struck, shattering Luo Bai's final illusion, leaving only his true self.

"Come forth!" Luo Bai's eyes bore resentment. His hands moved again, the illusion reconstituting into black mist.

"You really think I can't handle this fake?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed like lightning, two purple divine lights appearing.

Gray energy burst from Luo Tian's body, forming nine soul blades. They instantly slashed the nine Luo Bais.

Soul blades moved swiftly, slicing through the nine figures. Black mist surged again, but this time a scream echoed in Luo Tian's ears, making his lips twitch slightly.

"Divine Soul! You possess a technique to attack my divine soul!" Luo Bai's eyes bore disbelief, sensing severe damage to his soul. His face paled.

With divine soul wounded, Luo Bai had no energy left to maintain the other eight illusions. He clutched his head in agony.

"What's happening!" Everyone was astonished, only those above could see Luo Tian's soul blades. Their eyes bore amazement.

"Divine soul strength!"

"Physical body is monstrous! How deep did this Luo Chen hide?" The people above fell silent. Today's Luo Tian had shocked them greatly.

"Chen'er, is this truly your strength?" Luoshui's eyes welled with tears, though they vanished instantly.

"This child must be eliminated; otherwise, it will bring endless trouble!" Luochen stood beside Luoshui, his eyes deep and dark as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's form flickered, ignoring the head-clutching Luo Bai. He appeared beside him and delivered another punch.

"I've been waiting for you!" As Luo Tian's fist flew, the seemingly agonized Luo Bai suddenly lifted his head and spat forcefully.

Black smoke erupted from Luo Bai's mouth, instantly enveloping Luo Tian. The black mist seeped into his body, causing Luo Tian's face to shift slightly.

"Crack..." However, Luo Tian struck Luo Bai's chest with a punch. A crisp sound echoed, sending Luo Bai flying backward and coughing up two mouthfuls of blood.

"What good is it to injure me? You are the one who will die!" Luo Bai's voice rang out, his eyes filled with triumph.

"Snort!" Pain instantly invaded Luo Tian's entire body. He could feel the black mist entering his body, rapidly attaching to his divine soul and continuously invading it.

Within a few breaths, cold sweat streamed down Luo Tian's forehead. In this short time, the black mist had eroded part of his divine soul. If not stopped, within an hour, Luo Tian's divine soul would be completely consumed.

"See what you have against me!" Luo Bai laughed, his form moving like a ghost toward Luo Tian. He gave no chance for respite.

Black fists flew continuously, and the two clashed again, still evenly matched.

Yet this time, Luo Bai had the upper hand due to the black mist's hindrance.

Luo Tian tried many times but achieved nothing. Only Xiaoqi remained unused.

"Don't struggle, this poison is unbearable even for a True Immortal Advanced!" Luo Bai mocked relentlessly, confident of victory.

"Senior Brother Luo Bai truly is Senior Brother Luo Bai. Even Luo Chen was beaten!"

"You see, he's still his senior brother!" People whispered among themselves, watching the triumphant Luo Bai.

"Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison!" While fending off Luo Bai's attacks, Luo Tian discovered a way to counter the black mist. He found that Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison was an effective countermeasure against the black mist.

Four dragons and four elephants roared within Luo Tian's body, fiercely devouring the black mist that invaded his divine soul.

As the black mist was gradually consumed, Luo Tian's pain lessened. His strength returned and he began to fight back.

"30%... 60%... 100%..." In a short time, Luo Tian fully recovered. No longer subdued by Luo Bai, he now matched him evenly and even gradually overpowered him.

"How could he break through the poison?!" Luo Bai's heart trembled. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to overcome it.

"How could he?!" Not only was Luo Bai shocked, but Luoshui and Duan Peizhen also bore disbelief. They knew how terrifying the poison was.

After subduing the mist, Luo Tian waved his hand. Four black demons and four black dragons flew from his hands toward Luo Bai.

The moment the eight titanic beings appeared, a terrifying pressure spread. It was an instinctive fear, like common ghosts encountering three dogs, causing involuntary reverence.

"Block it!" Though a sense of worship arose, Luo Bai gritted his teeth. He had no choice but to resist since he had no path back.

"Buzz..." As the four titanic beings descended, Luo Bai waved his hand. A blood-red ghost scroll appeared in his grasp.

Like a river of crimson, Luo Bai waved it toward the eight titanic beings. The blood-red river cut through the four dragons and four elephants, turning them into black mist.

"Stop!" As the blood-red river struck the first dragon, Luo Tian shouted loudly.

"It's too late..." Luo Bai's face bore a cold smile. He didn't hesitate, driving the blood-red river to strike one of the black dragons.

"Boom..." The black dragon exploded in the sky. Luo Tian didn't care, immediately forming a barrier. A terrifying windstorm swept across it.

Chapter 2080: Killing Ghost

The black barrier enveloped Luo Tian, allowing the windstorm to rage. Luo Tian felt uneasy and moved his hands again, summoning four dragons and four elephants.

Boom boom boom... Luo Bai relentlessly summoned the blood-red river, striking the four dragons and four elephants. Black smoke instantly filled the arena, sweeping toward all directions.

"A scent of fragrance?" The Luo family members puzzled, sniffing the air and gazing at the approaching smoke.

"Everyone scatter!" Seeing the black smoke, Luoshui and Luochen's faces changed. They all acted immediately.

But it was too late; many Luo family disciples were engulfed by the black smoke. Suffering cries echoed from beneath the arena.

Those surrounded by the smoke fell to the ground, writhing in agony. Their eyes bore terror.

"Thud... Thud..." A number of Luo family disciples fell to the ground, their eyes vacant. Their life forces had vanished.

"Rip..." A massive rift tore open in the heavens, drawing in the black smoke with a powerful suction. The dead bodies scattered around the arena numbered over a hundred, all with soul death but remaining physical forms.

"I told you not to strike. You wouldn't listen. Look what's happened now!" The barrier faded, and the four dragons and four elephants rushed toward the stunned Luo Bai. Accompanying them was Luo Tian.

The four dragons and four elephants that Luo Tian had summoned were meant to consume the poison within his body. When Luo Bai severed them, the poison exploded completely. While Luo Tian could withstand it, others couldn't.

The blood-red river swept again, striking the four dragons and four elephants. Each strike produced a piercing scream.

This scream was extremely grating, like an infant's cry, making people feel uncomfortable.

"Family Head, Luo Chen dared to poison our family disciples. His heart is despicable!" Luochen shouted loudly, his voice filled with anger.

"Yes, Family Head. We've lost over a hundred geniuses today. I agree with the Hall Master's statement!" As Luochen's words fell, eight True Immortal Advanced elders followed suit.

"Water Brother, Luo Chen has indeed gone too far!" Duan Peizhen also spoke sharply.

"Yes, Family Head. Fortunately, the elders reacted quickly and prevented a catastrophe. If that smoke had spread further, we would all be dead!" Luochen's words sparked anger among the Luo family disciples.

Luoshui coldly watched Luochen and others. Their gazes met, then she spoke softly: "Luo Chen's actions were indeed inappropriate. But where did the poison come from?"

"Senior Brother Bai also knew about the poison within the four dragons and four elephants!" Luoshui's words silenced everyone.

"Yes, Senior Brother Bai used the poison first. He must have known about the poison within the four dragons and four elephants... he still struck them... this..." People murmured, their gazes turning to Luo Bai's continuous attacks.

Luo Bai was always seen as a prodigy, and most people perceived him as kind. But this strike clearly showed he didn't value the lives of Luo family disciples. If he had noticed, he wouldn't have struck the four dragons and four elephants.

"Seems he still values his son's life!" Luochen mused, his eyes dark with cruelty. His words were a test of Luoshui's feelings toward Luo Chen.

"True restraint! For so many years, he never cared about Luo Chen's survival!"

"These two fathers and sons are both ruthless. One revealed his brilliance now, the other remained hidden to let his son survive!" Several True Immortal Advanced elders gazed at Luoshui, admiration in their eyes.

"Divine Infant Scroll!" Luoshui's eyes bore anger. She coldly spoke, gazing at the blood-red river clashing with Luo Tian.

"What? That's the legendary Divine Infant Scroll!" Hearing Luoshui's words, everyone's faces changed.

"How could Senior Brother Bai create such a cruel item!" The Divine Infant Scroll required the blood of ten thousand infants to be refined. Its power was boundless, but its methods were too cruel for most to use.

"Ah! That's why every collision produces the sound of an infant's cry. It must be that ten thousand infant souls are being destroyed in the clash!"

"To restore it to peak power, one must kill more infants to replenish it!" People gasped. Their gazes toward Luo Bai changed completely. Though people in Hell didn't value human life, this act was still despicable.

"Too cruel!" Luo Tian kept striking the blood-red river. Hearing the infants' cries, he felt pity.

"Soulsnatch!" Luo Tian roared. His hands moved swiftly, drawing in a suction that landed on the blood-red river.

"Buzz..." Gray mist burst from the blood-red river, forming into infant figures that appeared before everyone's eyes. The cries of countless infants echoed in people's ears, their souls drifting in the sky.

Luo Bai's face slightly changed. He hadn't expected his Divine Infant Scroll to fail against Luo Tian. He didn't want to reveal it, but the Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison had put too much pressure on him. After all, it was a technique passed down by the Dragon-Eagle to Luo Tian, capable of subduing an entire ghost gate in Hell.

"Reincarnation..." Luo Tian sighed, striking a punch. A gray passage appeared, drawing in the infant souls.

Without the infant soul's support, the blood-red river lost some of its luster. Yet it still radiated a terrifying presence.

"Jail Ghost Claws!" Luo Tian shouted again. Black mist surged from his body, darkening the sky like a storm cloud, making the world lose color.

The black mist tore apart. A massive black claw pierced the heavens, over a hundred feet in size. Its sharpness radiated from its fingertips. Black scales covered the claw, though it looked thin, it exuded immense power.

"That cursed woman's technique!" Duan Peizhen immediately recognized the black claw, her eyes wild with fury. The black claw instantly grabbed the blood-red river, tearing it apart and continuing toward Luo Bai.

"Get out!" Luo Bai roared. His body erupted with thunderous sounds, True Immortal power bursting forth. A black ghost face appeared in the heavens, swallowing the black claw.

Collision sounds echoed. The black ghost face and the ghost claws shattered. The powerful collision made even True Immortal Advanced elders feel shocked. Luo family disciples were sent flying in large numbers, but no one was injured.

"Kill..." As the gusts of wind surged, Luo Tian and Luo Bai clashed again, striking each other repeatedly.

"If they were united, our family would be the top among the three families!" The Luo family members marveled at the two fighting.

"Senior Brother Bai hasn't looked so helpless in a long time!" People's faces bore shock, gazing at Luo Bai fighting alongside Luo Tian.

At this moment, Luo Bai was in extreme disarray. His white robe was torn and ragged, his hair disheveled. He bore several wounds, with a continuous crackling sound from within his body—evidently, some bones had been broken and were repairing themselves.

Compared to Luo Bai's state, Luo Tian was much better. His terrifying physical strength fully manifested, with only a few wounds—non-lethal.

"Come forth, my soul-bound ghost!" As Luo Bai retreated, his arm radiated fluctuations. A black mist formed into black runes, inscribed onto the torn arena. Fluctuations spread outward as a massive black creature appeared before everyone's eyes.

Two black scythes formed into arms. Its thin legs were muscular, with a triangular head and two sharp teeth glowing with cold light. Two transparent wings rose from its back.

"Killing Life Ghost!" People immediately recognized the beast upon seeing it.

"Buzz..." As the Killing Life Ghost appeared, its wings flapped. It vanished from its position instantly.

"So fast..." Luo Tian felt a blur, his body suddenly staggered. Two wounds appeared on him, and the wounds bore traces of black mist—corrosive power that prevented healing.

"Roar..." The Killing Life Ghost reappeared, but now at another position.

"Little one, this Killing Life Ghost was raised with my blood and the Feeding Ghost Pills. Compared to normal Killing Life Ghosts, it's more bloodthirsty! Though only at True Immortal Initial strength, it's several times stronger than regular ones!" Luo Bai appeared beside Luo Tian, delivering a palm strike.

"Is that true?" Luo Tian endured the punch, spitting out blood. Yet his words carried disdain.

"This time, Luo Chen is surely finished!" The Luo family members erupted in chaos. Their gazes turned to Luo Tian, who was dodging attacks.

The Killing Life Ghost combined with Luo Bai had left Luo Tian in a dire situation. His wounds could not heal, and all felt he was doomed—even Luoshui. Only two people remained unaffected: Zhang Menlie and Liu Cheng. They knew Luo Tian possessed a technique comparable to a Grade-1 Ghost Feeder.

"Open the Ghost Pulse!" Luo Bai roared, his voice cold. Eight black dragons burst from his body, swirling toward Luo Tian.

The eight dragons moved swiftly, instantly enveloping Luo Tian. A crushing force made his face shift slightly.

"Final Kill!"

"That's Senior Brother Bai's seal formed from eight ghost pulses within his body. It's impossible to break free. With Senior Brother Bai's current cultivation, even a True Immortal Advanced would take time to break it!"

"Combined with the Killing Life Ghost, this is a final kill. He's aiming to end Luo Chen!" The crowd murmured, their gazes upon Luo Bai, who also bore a pale face. Clearly, using eight pulses to suppress was a significant drain on him.

"If this is your entire strength, then you may die!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, allowing the black dragons to wrap around him.

"Buzz..." A sharp blade appeared at Luo Tian's throat. The Killing Life Ghost's massive body stood before him, its mouth drooling as if it had found a delicacy.

"Boom..." Everyone gasped. Luoshui stood up, extending her hand. But no one noticed a dark light spewing from Luo Tian's mouth into the Killing Life Ghost's hollow eye.

The scene seemed frozen. The sharp blade halted at Luo Tian's throat, blood flowing down. If it advanced further, his head would be severed.

"Return!" A cold voice echoed. The Killing Life Ghost's blade halted instantly. Blood flowed from Luo Tian's neck, and he stood there with authority.

"Kill him!" Luo Tian spoke again. The Killing Life Ghost's eyes filled with black mist, and it withdrew its blade. It suddenly reversed direction, rushing toward Luo Bai.

"Here it is! I was subdued by this move back then!" Liu Cheng's eyes bore helplessness.

Zhang Menlie also sighed deeply. His life was now tied to Luo Tian's. If Luo Tian died, according to Luo Bai's nature, he wouldn't let him live. The Zhang family would also not allow it. Thus, Zhang Menlie hoped Luo Tian would shine within the Luo family so he could have no life worries and perhaps even better development.

Too fast for anyone to react, even Luo Bai's face shifted slightly. In an instant, his connection with the Killing Life Ghost was severed.

When Luo Bai recovered, the Killing Life Ghost's blade had already descended from the void toward him.

"Pu..." Blood splattered. Luo Bai barely managed a scream before his body flew backward, and one arm fell to the ground where he stood.

"Crush..." Luo Bai was severely wounded. The eight dragons wrapping Luo Tian seemed weakened slightly. Naturally, Luo Tian wouldn't miss this chance. Each black dragon continuously shattered before him.

Arm severed, seal broken. Luo Bai's entire body swayed violently. With each seal shattered, he spat out blood.

"Die!" Luo Bai shouted, his remaining hand swiftly forming a seal. A black sword flew from his grasp toward Luo Tian's direction.

"Die yourself!" Luo Tian's face bore disdain. The final dragon shattered, and he activated the Ghostly Steps to rush toward Luo Bai.
