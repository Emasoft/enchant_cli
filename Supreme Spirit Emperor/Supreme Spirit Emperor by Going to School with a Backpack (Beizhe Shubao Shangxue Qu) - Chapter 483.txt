“Had I known, I would have prepared more medicinal herbs. With my strength, I could have definitely caught Master Xuan Dan’s attention!” The regretful voice echoed across the arena, laced with resentment.

In an instant, half the participants had vanished from the platform. The remaining stood with expressions of relief and smugness.

“Alright, choose your own,” Xuan Dan smiled, gazing at the now much emptier platform before speaking again.

“Wait!” Just as Xuan Dan’s words faded, a voice rang out from the sky. A streak of black light flashed, its tone cold and unfeeling.

“Dare you disrupt the Dan Competition?” Zhao Ritian barked, raising his hand. A golden hand shot forth toward the black light.

“Leave…” The cold, emotionless voice echoed through the sky. All present shivered involuntarily. The black light ignored Zhao Ritian’s golden hand, smashing it apart before landing on the platform.

“You dare to attack me!” Before anyone could discern the shadow’s form, the platform trembled violently. The shadow vanished from its place.

“Crack…” A moment later, Zhao Ritian’s body was struck as if by an invisible force. He flew backward in a burst of motion.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, then widened with surprise. He hadn’t expected the Tianlong Sect to harbor such a formidable master. Yet, he sensed an unfamiliar aura on the shadow—Ultimate Stage.

“Cen Hongwei!” After felling Zhao Ritian, the black figure stood still. A wave of gasps followed.

Draped in a dark windbreaker, his physique remained obscured. His long black hair swayed with the breeze. A chilling aura radiated from him, his eyes sharp and cruel. The most striking feature was the jagged scars across his face, erasing any trace of former beauty and giving him an ominous chill.

“Cen Hongwei. Why are you here?” Zhao Ritian rose, spitting out two teeth and wiping blood from his lips. A red handprint marred his face, yet he dared not utter a word.

“Master Xuan Dan, may I participate in the Dan Competition? Am I too late?” Cen Hongwei ignored the astonished glances around him, his gaze fixed on Xuan Dan. His voice remained cold.

“Alas… Hongwei, why must you do this? If you wish to participate, then proceed,” Xuan Dan sighed deeply.

“Rumors spread. No one expected Cen Hongwei to appear for the Dan Competition,” Luo Tian observed, catching a flicker of reverence in Cen Hongwei’s eyes.

Chapter 1866: All Is Strategy

“Begin,” Xuan Dan murmured, casting a lingering glance at Cen Hongwei.

Though the competition had started, others hesitated. Cen Hongwei’s aura was oppressive, radiating a sinister energy that made the crowd reluctant to act.

“Will you challenge me?” Cen Hongwei let out a cold laugh. His expression, though smiling, was grotesque with the scars on his face.

“Tch…” The crowd’s faces shifted. It was a blatant threat.

“If anyone dares to challenge me, consider carefully. I’ll count to one hundred. If you don’t step down yourself, I’ll send you away,” Cen Hongwei’s expression darkened. His gaze alone could haunt one for days.

“One… two…” Cen Hongwei ignored their thoughts, counting aloud while scanning the crowd.

“Cen Senior Brother, we dare not challenge you!” A few disciples leapt from the platform, fear in their eyes.

“Cen Senior Brother will surely win first place!” One after another, figures vanished from the platform.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian gaped at the sight. The disciples fled like plague carriers, leaving him flustered.

Dan masters were proud, but Luo Tian had never seen them flee at a single threat.

“Something’s off. This is merely a test of character!” He realized, watching Xuan Dan seated with half-closed eyes. The master’s method had been subtle yet effective, eliminating most participants.

“Cunning strategy! From the start, Xuan Dan used tricks. He did nothing but eliminate many,” Luo Tian mused. Those lacking the will to overcome adversity had no right to be Xuan Dan’s disciples.

Time passed. The arena now held fewer than seven people, a stark contrast to its former crowd.

“Already over?” Disciples glared at Cen Hongwei standing atop the platform.

“Still considering? Need me to act?” Cen Hongwei surveyed the remaining few, including Luo Tian.

“Only Master Xuan Dan’s six disciples remain. And that Luo Tian?” As more vanished, the remaining stood out in the now-empty platform.

“Cunning strategy indeed!” Luo Tian marveled, gazing at Xuan Dan. Yet he was curious—what had Cen Hongwei done to inspire such fear? His mere presence sent people fleeing.

“Cen Senior Brother, I wish to try!” A tall youth bowed respectfully toward Cen Hongwei.

“Niu Bian. Don’t take it too far. Step down yourself, and I’ll grant you face. If you persist, don’t blame me for our shared status as disciples,” Cen Hongwei sneered.

“Niu Bian…” Luo Tian felt exasperated. This youth had previously mocked him with ill intent, yet his name was oddly peculiar.

“Cen Hongwei… what are you doing?” Niu Bian’s face paled as Cen Hongwei approached, his body retreating.

“Son, you’ve got nerve. I’ll call you ‘Niu Pi’ instead,” Cen Hongwei snorted.

“Three breaths. If I see you still here, I’ll break your legs!” Cen Hongwei’s voice was cold. His eyes bore into Niu Bian.

“Cen Hongwei, you… you…” Niu Bian stammered, gasping for breath.

“Good. You’re bold. You’ve earned the name ‘Niu Pi’!” Niu Bian shouted, his face red. He leapt from the platform.

“Whirr…” Just as Niu Bian landed, a black hand snatched him back, dragging him like a chicken.

“Crack…” The black hand struck Niu Bian’s leg. A sharp sound echoed, causing a chill.

Blood rained from the platform. White bones jutted out. Niu Bian howled in agony, his cries laced with hatred.

“Did you think everyone was like you?” Cen Hongwei sneered, tossing Niu Bian down.

“Smack…” Niu Bian crashed onto the ground, unconscious. Others rushed to his aid.

“What happened?” Some were stunned; others stared at Cen Hongwei, who stood unyielding.

“This fool’s arrogance is a rarity,” Luo Tian mused, watching Cen Hongwei.

“Earlier, Niu Bian called Cen Hongwei ‘Niu Pi’—a pun on his name. Hence…” People murmured, suppressing laughter.

“Will you challenge me?” Cen Hongwei turned, his eyes dark as he gazed at Zhao Ritian and Luo Tian.

Zhao Ritian’s group looked uneasy. They wanted to fight but recoiled at Niu Bian’s fate.

“Son, you are Luo Tian?” Cen Hongwei fixed his gaze on Luo Tian, scanning him with a glint of murder in his eyes.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. He sensed Cen Hongwei’s intent to kill. Though he didn’t know why, he dismissed it.

Cen Hongwei was strong, but Luo Tian had no fear. To dominate him? Cen Hongwei’s strength wasn’t enough.

“Boom…” Luo Tian sneered, raising his hand. A cauldron flew from it, expanding and landing on the platform with a heavy sound.

“Seems I must fight alone!” Cen Hongwei sneered, then lunged at Luo Tian.

“Phew…” Zhao Ritian and the others sighed. At least Cen Hongwei had shifted his focus to Luo Tian.

“This fool will die or lose a limb!” Zhao Ritian mused, recalling how Luo Tian had humiliated him before the Dan Sect.

“Fear me?” Luo Tian sneered. He wouldn’t retreat, knowing Cen Hongwei’s true allegiance. If he knew, he’d have “accidentally” killed Cen Hongwei.

Luo Tian stood still as the black light charged. He crouched slightly, then launched a golden fist.

“Smack…” The collision of black and gold echoed.

“Stomp… stomp… stomp…” Cen Hongwei retreated, leaving footprints on the platform. His eyes widened in surprise.

“Sigh…” Gasps echoed from both the platform and below.

“Cen Senior Brother was repelled by Luo Tian! Yet Luo Tian stood unmoved!” A disciple murmured.

“Am I seeing things?” Many rubbed their eyes, staring at Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei.

Cen Hongwei, the top-ranked in the Sky Dragon Rankings, an Ultimate Stage master and Tianlong Sect’s prodigy—today he was repelled by a mere outer sect disciple.

“Haha! Finally found an interesting one!” Cen Hongwei laughed, his voice laced with intrigue.

“Unexpectedly met an Ultimate Stage. A coincidence!” Cen Hongwei licked his lips, eyeing Luo Tian like a predator.

“I dislike your gaze!” Luo Tian narrowed his eyes at Cen Hongwei’s stare.

“Ultimate Stage. Luo Tian is also an Ultimate Stage! No wonder he isn’t afraid of this Senior Brother!” People murmured, their gazes toward Luo Tian now different.

“Again!” Cen Hongwei roared, summoning a black storm toward Luo Tian.

“My body is invincible!” Luo Tian shook his head, still standing. A faint golden glow radiated from him.

“Enough…” As Cen Hongwei prepared to clash with Luo Tian, Xuan Dan opened his eyes lazily. He spoke softly.

At the same time, a powerful pressure descended on both Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei. Cen Hongwei halted; Luo Tian’s golden glow dimmed.

“This is a Dan Competition, not a life-or-death fight. Focus on refining herbs. If you don’t refine, there’s no competition!” Xuan Dan smiled, gazing at the characters written in the sky, now dimming.

“Forgot to tell you—these have time limits. If you don’t memorize the herbs now, it’s too late!” Xuan Dan smiled at Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei.

“Yes,” Cen Hongwei bowed slightly, ceasing to trouble Luo Tian. He stood nearby without seeking Zhao Ritian’s trouble. His gaze turned toward the fading characters in the sky.

Seeing Cen Hongwei leave him alone, Zhao Ritian and others smiled broadly. They began memorizing the herbs in the sky.

“Sizzle…” Suddenly, a scorching heat rose from the platform. Seven-colored flames erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, entering the Heavenly Ultimate Flame Cauldron.

“What’s going on?” Everyone was stunned. Luo Tian had begun refining without memorizing the herbs!

“Does he not need to remember the herbs?” Confusion spread. No one understood Luo Tian’s move.

“Those flames—why seven colors? I’ve never seen this before!”

“Human-shaped flames!” Xuan Dan’s eyes narrowed, his gaze flickering with intensity.

“This fool must have stepped on countless dogs in a past life to cultivate human-shaped flames!” Xuan Dan mused.

Chapter 1867: Disgrace

“Seems this kid’s Dan skills aren’t bad,” a few elders remarked, watching Luo Tian’s seven-colored flames. Though they couldn’t identify the flame’s grade, they felt its temperature—lowest was Heavenfire.

As people marveled, Luo Tian moved. His hands formed intricate seals around him.

The Thousand-Page Brushing Technique—Luo Tian had used it countless times. Each shadow could hold a herb.

“Ten… one hundred… two hundred thirty-six!” Xuan Dan gasped, standing up. His eyes widened in disbelief.

“My god! Two hundred thirty-six herbs at once!” Elders gasped, their faces shocked.

“Master Xuan Dan’s limit is two hundred sixty herbs. This kid already has two hundred thirty-six! His technique is incredible!” Elders murmured, their voices trembling. Even their techniques paled in comparison to Luo Tian’s.

“Two hundred thirty-six?” Luo Tian sneered internally. His limit was three hundred. If he hadn’t needed only two hundred thirty-six herbs, he’d have left them speechless.

Zhao Ritian and Cen Hongwei had just memorized the herbs, pondering what to refine. They saw Luo Tian’s Thousand-Page Brushing Technique and were stunned.

Xuan Dan’s face lit up with excitement, his fists clenched. Yet no one noticed his oddity.

“Thousand-Page Brushing Technique!” Xuan Dan murmured, his eyes alight with joy. His body trembled, breaths quickened as he stared at Luo Tian.

“Whirr…” The shadows vanished. People regained their senses, and the elders noticed Xuan Dan’s trance.

“Nothing much—just observing this kid. He’s a promising talent,” Xuan Dan suppressed his excitement, gazing at Luo Tian with contemplation.

Healing Pill—Fourth-grade Dan, consumed during the Celestial Immortal’s mid-stage. One Healing Pill equaled five years of cultivation.

Luo Tian mentally recalled his Dan recipe, directing his vast spiritual sense to refine the herbs into elixir.

“He mustn’t have a Fourth-grade recipe!” Zhao Ritian and others felt an ominous premonition. Luo Tian’s technique was beyond anyone’s comprehension, save Xuan Dan.

They began refining their own pills. Though stunned by Luo Tian’s technique, they didn’t give up—especially Cen Hongwei, his eyes burning with fierce determination.

“Indeed, there was no need to continue the competition!” Xuan Dan sighed internally. Luo Tian’s technique surpassed even his own comprehension.

Luo Tian’s movements flowed seamlessly as he condensed the elixir. Zhao Ritian and others started adding herbs to their cauldrons, their actions impressive but overshadowed by Luo Tian’s earlier display.

“Whirr…” White smoke rose from the Heavenly Ultimate Flame Cauldron. Luo Tian’s eyes locked onto it, his expression now grave. Fourth-grade Dan was challenging with limited herbs.

“Condense…” Others entered the condensation phase simultaneously. Six cauldrons stood on the platform. Elders formed a barrier around them.

“Six people can’t all succeed. These kids are refining Fourth-grade Dan!” Xuan Dan’s eyes gleamed, watching Luo Tian and others.

“Correct. Fourth-grade Dan—surrounding spiritual energy is insufficient. Success will be a fierce battle. Luo Tian has an edge, so he might succeed!” Elders nodded, their eyes sharp.

“Until the final moment, no one can predict victory!”

“Luo Tian may have gained an advantage when Cen Hongwei drove people away. But Cen Hongwei and Zhao Ritian are no pushovers. Their Dan skills must be exceptional to be Xuan Dan’s disciples!”

“Plus, Luo Tian is an outer sect disciple. His herbs are surely fewer than others. Thus, his choices are limited!” People murmured, anticipation in their eyes as they awaited the opening of the cauldrons.

Time passed. As people anxiously waited, dark clouds rose from the sky, enveloping the platform. A strong suction pulled at the cauldrons before them, hungrily absorbing spiritual energy.

At the same moment, Luo Tian and others opened their eyes, fierce determination in their gazes.

“Open!” Zhao Ritian roared, slapping his cauldron. Golden light surged skyward, a roaring sound echoing like a dragon’s cry.

“Open… open… open…” Before people recovered from their shock, more roars echoed. Cen Hongwei and others also opened their cauldrons.

“Whirr…” Multicolored glows shot skyward, causing people to gasp. Their eyes locked onto the pills within.

“All Fourth-grade Pills!” A wave of murmurs spread. Their eyes widened in surprise.

“These people hid their skills well! They claimed to be Third-grade Dan masters, yet they’re Fourth-grade Celestial Immortal masters!” People’s faces bore admiration.

Especially Cen Hongwei, whose brutal nature was offset by his strength. Strength was always respected.

Cen Hongwei’s prowess needed no explanation—Sky Dragon Rankings’ top, his Dan skills were equally terrifying.

“Do you think the previous Dan master, Dan Luo, was Cen Hongwei in disguise?” People then recalled Dan Luo, who had stunned the sect for a month.

A black pill hovered above Cen Hongwei’s head, its aura matching his.

“Why hasn’t Luo Tian opened his cauldron yet?” People noticed, seeing Luo Tian still grim-faced and focused.

“Damn it! They’re so fast…” Luo Tian cursed internally, fusing the elixir and absorbing spiritual energy.

“I see. It’s the Condensation Method. I developed it myself. They must have received guidance!” Luo Tian realized.

“Luo Tian has no chance to succeed. Now it’s their battle!” Elders shook their heads.

Xuan Dan watched Luo Tian closely, his eyes filled with surprise and confusion. He closed his eyes but opened them again upon seeing Luo Tian’s actions, his expression shocked.

“Could it be…” Xuan Dan murmured, his eyes wide with horror. He closed his mouth.

“If it’s true… he has the qualifications…” Xuan Dan mused silently. No one heard his words, all eyes on the platform as Cen Hongwei and others began their fierce competition.

“Come…” Cen Hongwei roared, his spiritual sense plunging into the black pill, hungrily absorbing spiritual energy.

“Don’t lose! Absolutely not!” Zhao Ritian and others roared, their spiritual senses activating. The pills began to devour spiritual energy.

The dark clouds thickened, a heavy atmosphere spreading across the platform. Everyone awaited eagerly—this was the critical moment. Who would emerge victorious?

Time passed. One hour had elapsed. The dark clouds descended further, lightning crackling within them as if deciding which pill to devour.

As time passed, spiritual energy reached its limit. Yet the pills still devoured it like ravenous beasts.

“Go!” Cen Hongwei’s eyes flickered with calculation. He pointed, and black light surged. A black dragon burst from his pill, lunging at a disciple’s red pill.

“Damn it! You forced me!” The disciple’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected Cen Hongwei to attack him.

At the same time, Zhao Ritian attacked. A golden dragon roared toward another disciple’s pill.

“Damn it!” Tian Xiong’s face darkened. Zhao Ritian and Cen Hongwei each targeted one, leaving him no opponent.

“Him!” Tian Xiong’s eyes brightened. He noticed Luo Tian by the cauldron.

“Roar…” A green dragon surged toward Luo Tian’s cauldron, aiming to devour its spiritual energy before it was complete.

“Despicable!” Everyone’s faces twisted with disdain. Tian Xiong had attacked Luo Tian, who hadn’t even completed his pill.

In Dan competitions, there was an unspoken rule: no one could attack another’s pill before it was complete. Otherwise, the victim would inevitably lose.

Though unspoken, most Dan masters adhered to it. Even Zhao Ritian and Cen Hongwei hadn’t attacked Luo Tian.

“Despicable? Disgraceful?” Luo Tian opened his eyes, staring at the green dragon charging toward his cauldron. A cold smile crossed his face.

Chapter 1868: Do You Know Him?

“You disgraceful! Don’t blame me!” Luo Tian sneered, watching the green dragon charge toward his Heavenly Ultimate Flame Cauldron.

“Whirr…” Luo Tian waved his hand. A golden spear, the Crack-Tearing Spear, appeared in his grasp. He swung it powerfully.

“What’s going on?” No one expected Luo Tian to attack Tian Xiong directly.

Tian Xiong was stunned. By the time he reacted, it was too late. The golden spear pierced his shoulder.

“Plop…” Blood splattered. Tian Xiong’s body was thrown backward, impaling the golden barrier.

“Smack…” At the same time, the green dragon crashed into the Heavenly Ultimate Flame Cauldron. It exploded, releasing dense spiritual energy absorbed by Luo Tian.

“Thanks!” Luo Tian smiled, then resumed refining his pill.

“Why is this kid more disgraceful than Tian Xiong?” People’s mouths twitched. Tian Xiong had attacked Luo Tian’s pill, but Luo Tian directly attacked Tian Xiong.

“My pill!” Tian Xiong was pinned, his face pale. He roared, eyes filled with fury.

“Idiot! Stay put!” Luo Tian leaned on the Heavenly Ultimate Flame Cauldron with one hand, and with the other, he formed seals. Dragon-like inscriptions burst forth, sealing Tian Xiong within the barrier.

“Dare to move me? You’re not worthy!” Luo Tian sneered, ignoring Tian Xiong’s cries.

“Boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed. On the other side, Cen Hongwei and Zhao Ritian entered a fierce phase. Dragons collided repeatedly.

“You keep shouting—your head will be torn off!” Cen Hongwei, seeing Tian Xiong’s outbursts, sneered. His black dragon instantly shredded the red dragon and began devouring it.

“Smack…” A blast echoed. The red pill exploded, its energy consumed by the black dragon.

A glossy black pill, like a moon of darkness, hovered in Cen Hongwei’s eyes.

“Not enough!” Cen Hongwei licked his crimson lips, gazing at another battlefield.

At this moment, Zhao Ritian also devoured a disciple’s pill. A golden dragon circled above him.

“Final victory!” Zhao Ritian’s face burned with battle spirit. This was his first confrontation against Cen Hongwei in his specialty. He wouldn’t lose again!

“As you wish!” Cen Hongwei sneered, controlling his black dragon toward Zhao Ritian’s golden one.

“Final battle!” Everyone held their breath, watching the two dragons charge at each other.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed. The two dragons collided fiercely under everyone’s anticipation.

“Crack…” A sharp sound. Suddenly, the golden dragon shattered.

“For Cen Senior Brother, I submit!” Zhao Ritian’s face was ashen. He watched his golden pill shatter and bowed to Cen Hongwei.

“Cen Senior Brother is truly a genius!” People gasped. No one expected Cen Hongwei, who had remained low-key, to win the Dan Competition.

A moment later, everyone’s gaze turned toward Cen Hongwei with even greater reverence. Praise filled the air.

“Open…” As people murmured, Luo Tian’s low voice echoed. His white hands gently tapped the Heavenly Ultimate Flame Cauldron.

“Roar…” Nine seven-colored fire dragons burst from the cauldron, circling it. Golden light surged skyward, a wild aura spreading instantly. A golden vortex rose, shining like the sun.

“Is that…” Everyone erupted in chatter. No one expected Luo Tian’s pill to emerge now, creating such a commotion.

The golden vortex twisted space before the black dragon. The golden dragon hadn’t fully dispersed, and from afar, it seemed like two dragons playing with a pearl.

“Come here!” Luo Tian laughed. The golden vortex spun rapidly, like an endless hole, engulfing the two dragons.

“Roar…” The dragons roared, their bodies twisted and devoured by the golden vortex.

“How is this possible!” Everyone’s faces bore disbelief. No one expected such a dramatic ending.

“Whirr…” The humming echoed. Two dragons twisted, devoured by the golden vortex and absorbed completely.

“Damn it!” Cen Hongwei cursed. He had already secured victory but was now ruined by Luo Tian.

“How did he do it!” After the shock, everyone puzzled. They couldn’t fathom why Luo Tian’s pill was so strong it devoured Cen Hongwei’s.

“His medicinal power! If I’m not mistaken, this kid’s pill must have reached a terrifying level!” Xuan Dan’s face bore surprise but his eyes were filled with excitement.

“Boom…” Golden lightning rained down. Thick snakes of lightning descended from the sky, striking the golden vortex through the barrier.

Yet the powerful Dan trial had no effect on the golden vortex, which twisted and absorbed it.

“One… two…” After four Dan lightning strikes, the clouds dispersed. The golden vortex hovered above Luo Tian’s head.

“Excellent! He refined a Healing Pill with nearly 90% potency. It should equal ten years of cultivation!” Luo Tian mused, storing the Healing Pill. It was his creation, so it belonged to him.

Silence. The entire Dan Sect fell silent. People’s faces bore awe, gazing at Luo Tian with a smile.

“This time, the Dan Competition winner is Luo Tian!” An old voice echoed. Xuan Dan stood up slowly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Unexpectedly, you’re so strong!” Cen Hongwei spoke for the first time with a solemn tone. It was as if he acknowledged Luo Tian.

“Overwhelming!” Everyone recalled the competition’s process, realizing Luo Tian had dominated at every stage. It was only his slower final phase that made people overlook it.

Luo Tian slowly approached the barrier, pulling out the Crack-Tearing Spear. Tian Xiong’s pale face dropped from the barrier.

“Alright, everyone knows now. Luo Tian is this Dan Competition’s winner!” Xuan Dan spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“What kind of look is that?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing Xuan Dan’s gaze. It was subtle yet filled with satisfaction and excitement.

“However, I cannot take him as my disciple!” Xuan Dan spoke again, causing people’s expressions to freeze.

“What? Did Master Xuan Dan change his mind? Luo Tian’s Dan skills rival the sect elders! Why didn’t Master Xuan Dan choose him? He previously said he would take the winner as a disciple!” People erupted again.

“I will take Cen Hongwei as my disciple!” Xuan Dan spoke again, directing everyone’s gaze to Cen Hongwei. Even Cen Hongwei’s body paused slightly.

“Why? I can’t say yet!” Xuan Dan spoke again, his voice urgent. “Everyone, disperse! Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei stay!”

“I’ll see what tricks you old man have up your sleeve!” Luo Tian sneered, standing still.

“Go,” Xuan Dan ignored the crowd. He grabbed Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei, flying toward the back of the Dan Sect.

Time passed. Xuan Dan led Cen Hongwei to the courtyard Luo Tian had visited before. He formed seals, enclosing it with barriers.

“Hongwei, I found you thirty years ago,” Xuan Dan said, his hands behind his back. His face bore nostalgia.

“Yes.” Cen Hongwei’s scarred face showed respect, kneeling before Xuan Dan.

“Ah! I see now!” Luo Tian’s face bore understanding. He crossed his arms, watching like an observer.

“Your growth over the years has been witnessed by me. The incident from before was always a barrier in your heart. You’re a tragic soul, but you’ve reached this point through your own efforts! Yet your character has flaws. I hope you can overcome it yourself,” Xuan Dan spoke again, his eyes filled with disappointment.

“I understand!” Cen Hongwei’s eyes showed ferocity but remained respectful. He knelt silently.

“Your path must be walked by yourself. Today, I ask you once: are you willing to become my disciple?”

“Think carefully. If you do, from now on, you may become an enemy of the world, hunted like a stray dog!” Xuan Dan spoke again. His tone was cold but made Luo Tian’s heart sink.

“Back then, when you found me from that icy graveyard, my life was yours. This debt is greater than heaven. Even if I face the world’s enemies, I Cen Hongwei have no regrets!” Cen Hongwei’s face bore determination.

“Good.” Xuan Dan nodded. He waved his hand, and a booming sound echoed. A stone statue appeared before Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei.

The statue was of a youth, his eyes blazing. His face bore determination. The posture was sword-drawing. Though stone, Luo Tian felt an aura of pride and overwhelming power from it.

“Wait… why does this statue look so familiar!” Luo Tian scrutinized the statue, then shivered.

“Luo Tian, do you know this person?” Xuan Dan’s eyes held a smile as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 1869: Xuan Dan’s Identity

“Ah, no. I don’t know!” Luo Tian shook his head, laughing nervously. His gaze turned to Xuan Dan.

“Zhang Daotian!” Luo Tian glanced again at the statue, his heart racing. He hadn’t expected to see Zhang Daotian’s statue here.
