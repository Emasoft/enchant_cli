"Big brother, what do you think? Come with me. I'll let you dominate the Turnaround Palace. Don't take my word for it—I've slaughtered rivers of blood, even slain a late True Immortal. These people in the Turnaround Palace are truly unfriendly. I only trust you!"

"Let's join forces and carve out a name for ourselves in the Turnaround Palace. How about that?" Luo Tian spoke again, his voice laced with mockery.

"You're still going on? If you want to kill me or torture me, just do it. You dream of my submission!" Ye Chen's face was filled with anger.

"Never mind, stay in this courtyard and don't wander off—this place isn't safe!" Luo Tian instructed Ye Chen, then stopped trying to persuade him.

Ye Chen said nothing. He knew where he was and his identity. If someone recognized him, he'd be in deep trouble.

Time passed slowly. Another seven days had gone by, and Luo Tian had fully understood the ninety-nine layers' inhabitants. The strongest among them was a True Immortal in the mid-stage named Wan Tianyi.

The deeper one went, the stronger the strength became. Each layer housed nearly 100,000 disciples, making the Turnaround Palace home to nearly ten million people.

This was just the Turnaround Palace itself, not counting the forces it ruled over—there were still many cities.

Luo Tian's first inquiry was about Fu Xingxuan, but her name was known to all. Du Li also knew of her.

The Turnaround Palace's Holy Maiden, whose status rivaled the Eight Heavenly Lords, resided in the final layer near the Reincarnation Hell.

To meet Fu Xingxuan, one had to wait for the annual Reincarnation Pool's opening.

The Reincarnation Pool, the Turnaround Palace's sacred site, opened once every ten years. When it did, it released thick ghostly qi to nourish the disciples' cultivation. The pool also contained treasures left by past Heavenly Lords, but access required a spot in the sixty-sixth layer's inner disciples.

There was another possibility: if Fu Xingxuan herself emerged, but this was rare. Since entering the Turnaround Palace, she had only appeared four times.

"This is a problem," Luo Tian muttered quietly, his eyes filled with contemplation.

"Let's see. This situation isn't suitable for meeting her. Even if we met, she wouldn't recognize me!"

"Unless the Pillar of Heaven Stone helps! No matter what, it's better to meet her at least once!" Luo Tian thought.

For the next period, Luo Tian remained low-key in the ninety-nine layers. Each day, an hour was spent with Du Jianxing at the Sword Peak to cultivate, and the rest of his time was devoted to training in the courtyard, occasionally teasing Ye Chen.

While Luo Tian remained low-key, a group of battered figures appeared at the Turnaround Palace's main hall. This group was led by Lin Dong, part of the Transcendent Beast King Mountains' faction.

"Finally home! My god, don't let me see that person again—if I do, I'll rip his sinews out and peel his skin!" A youth, covered in dried blood, shouted angrily.

"Right! But that bastard ran too fast—I only saw his back and a big sword!" Others cursed.

The thirty-person group had originally planned to reach the Turnaround Palace in days but dragged on for half a month, losing three members in the Beast King Mountains.

Including Lin Dong, the remaining disciples were all injured, leaving them with deep resentment toward that bastard.

"Alright, you're back. Go rest," Lin Dong sighed deeply, leading them into the Turnaround Palace. At this moment, he just wanted to rest.

Twenty-seven people flew swiftly back to their quarters and began resting.

"You're certain, can you silently enter the final layer?" Luo Tian asked the Pillar of Heaven Stone while sitting in his room.

"Of course! Don't you know who I am? I'm the Pillar of Heaven Stone, omnipotent in heaven and earth! Back then I..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the Pillar of Heaven Stone began boasting again.

"Good. Take me to the final layer!"

"But we'll just look around—don't touch anything at the bottom!" Luo Tian said seriously.

"No problem, I'm just a stone; what do I need?" The Pillar of Heaven Stone quickly assured him, stating he didn't require anything.

Luo Tian was too eager to see Fu Xingxuan's condition; after all, this was hell.

"Buzz..." A wave of energy struck Luo Tian, and he felt a displacement force—his body vanished from the original spot, appearing on a red earth. Warmth radiated through his feet, spreading across his body.

"Where am I?" Luo Tian looked around; everything was red, and the sky remained black.

"Dammit, you're stepping on me!" The Pillar of Heaven Stone's discontented voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Where is he?" Ye Chen, who had been sitting in the courtyard, suddenly noticed Luo Tian's absence and rushed into the room. He found no sign of Luo Tian.

"This..." But Luo Tian clearly saw Ye Chen, though to him, Ye Chen appeared like a towering giant.

"Did I shrink?" Luo Tian's mind was stunned; this was his first time encountering such a situation.

"Did you see? Nothing is beyond my abilities!" The Pillar of Heaven Stone seemed pleased with Luo Tian's expression, boasting.

"Is this so amazing?" Luo Tian was completely stunned; he hadn't expected the Pillar of Heaven Stone to have such power.

"Let's go!" The Pillar of Heaven Stone spoke, and Luo Tian felt his body suddenly sink. The surroundings changed rapidly.

"Layer ninety-eight... layer ninety..." Flecks of dust fell swiftly, though each level was solid. However, the Pillar of Heaven Stone was merely a speck of dust, invisible to others.

Luo Tian marveled at the changing scenery, his eyes filled with disbelief—this was too miraculous.

He also felt the Turnaround Palace's immense power; the first sixty-six layers were mostly True Immortal disciples.

What stunned Luo Tian most was the final thirty-three layers, where fewer people resided but all were in the late True Immortal or peak True Immortal stages. He even spotted eighteen half-step Immortal Kings.

Eighteen half-step Immortal Kings! Four early-stage Immortal Kings, four mid-stage—this was just one of the Ten Judges' Palaces. If all ten were combined, how terrifying hell would be! Luo Tian could barely imagine it.

Time passed; Luo Tian finally reached the second-to-last layer. The Pillar of Heaven Stone's speed slowed significantly here, as this was where Immortal Kings resided. Powerful beings would notice even the slightest disturbance.

Dust naturally drifted, and Luo Tian stood tensely on the red earth. He dared not use his spiritual sense to explore, even holding his breath.

They landed in this layer's courtyard, coincidentally belonging to an early-stage Immortal King. Fortunately, this was the same Heavenly Lord who had scolded Luo Tian earlier.

Guangmu Heavenly Lord Gu Mingliang, Luo Tian now knew the names of the Eight Heavenly Lords. At this moment, Gu Mingliang sat cross-legged, and when the Pillar of Heaven Stone transformed into dust and fell into the courtyard, Gu Mingliang opened his eyes. His cross-eyed gaze emitted a burst of spiritual light, scanning the direction of the Pillar of Heaven Stone.

"Strange!" However, Gu Mingliang's cross-eyed gaze soon showed confusion before he closed his eyes again.

"Damn it, cover your spiritual sense too! It's hard to bring someone along; even a lowly early-stage Immortal King almost found me!" The Pillar of Heaven Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Okay!" Hearing the Pillar of Heaven Stone, Luo Tian quickly concealed his aura, but he felt the stone's untrustworthiness.

"Buzz..." The dust slowly fell, and finally, under Luo Tian's anticipation, the Pillar of Heaven Stone led him into the final layer.

Upon entering the final layer, a wave of overwhelming ghostly qi struck Luo Tian, causing his face to shift slightly.

"Buzz..." Four cold glows rose, illuminating the dark hall. The final layer's scene appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

"Who is there?" Two cold voices echoed, and two figures—black and white—stood in the hall, gazing toward Luo Tian's direction.

A crushing pressure swept over him, making his heart tighten. However, his eyes showed disbelief because the two figures were familiar to him—more accurately, they had a grudge!

Luo Tian never expected to meet these two in the Turnaround Palace. Rather, they weren't people but ghostly beings—two ghosts who had reached the peak of Immortal King.

"Damn it, wasn't this supposed to be Fu Xingxuan's location?" Luo Tian cursed inwardly.

"Don't panic... don't panic..."

"Silence your thoughts; you can't see me... it's better if you don't see me!" The Pillar of Heaven Stone transmitted to Luo Tian, its voice trembling.

These two weren't just anyone; they were the two who had arrived in a boat when Luo Tian reversed reincarnation and rescued Ji Jiuyou. At that time, he was a pseudo-era master but felt like a child before them. He hadn't expected to meet them again after so many years.

Chapter 2127: Nothing ()

A middle-aged man with a black face and another with a white face stood there, identical in appearance. Due to being ghostly beings, their actual ages weren't like this.

However, the aura they radiated made Luo Tian tremble; these two were definitely the strongest he had ever encountered, surpassing Du Jianxing, the Poison Sword Heavenly Lord.

"How could it be them? My god..." Luo Tian never expected to meet these two.

At that time, he didn't know their cultivation level, but now he understood—they were beings who could crush him with a single breath.

"Come!" The black-faced man extended his hand, grabbing toward Luo Tian's direction, making Luo Tian's heart tremble.

He couldn't resist; he felt no will to fight, praying the Pillar of Heaven Stone would have a solution.

"Excuse me, I'll go first, master. You're blessed and fated to be safe!" The Pillar of Heaven Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind before he could react, then it flung Luo Tian from the red earth.

"Buzz..." Without the Pillar of Heaven Stone's cover, Luo Tian's body suddenly grew large and appeared in the hall. His face was shocked.

A massive black hand instantly appeared before Luo Tian, grabbing him and bringing him to the two men.

"Who are you?" The two men's faces showed surprise, their eyes like lightning scanning Luo Tian. Their expressions then turned to shock.

"You! You! You, that bastard—how could you hide your original face!" The pale-faced man exclaimed.

"Respected elders, it's been a long time..." Luo Tian trembled with fear, smiling awkwardly. He knew they recognized him from their eyes.

"Ha! You little bastard, finally caught you!" The two men spoke simultaneously, their voices filled with excitement.

"You ran away in front of us back then—what a disgrace! I never thought you'd end up in hell!" They both spoke, their voices filled with excitement.

"Done for... done for..." Luo Tian didn't dare speak, only smiling awkwardly while watching them nervously.

"What should we do with you? Skin you and throw you into hell?" The two men spoke in unison, their eyes playful.

"Respected elders, I didn't mean to... respected elders' achievements are unparalleled; you're true masters of the world. I was simply awed by your wisdom and might back then..." Luo Tian spoke endlessly, praising them to the max.

Luo Tian swore this was his most excessive flattery yet; he spoke until parched, but the two men only watched him without speaking.

Luo Tian saw it worked and became more enthusiastic, pouring all the flattery he'd heard over the years into their ears. He felt a deep sense of gratitude for mastering such a skill.

"Alright..." The two men initially enjoyed it, but after Luo Tian spoke for half an hour without repeating himself, they grew impatient.

"Yes!" Luo Tian quickly shut up, knowing it was time to stop. He stood straight and respectfully faced them.

"Leave your three drops of essence blood!" The two men spoke as if recalling something, addressing Luo Tian.

They remembered the words of that person, gazing at Luo Tian before speaking. Though they wanted to torment him, they hadn't found a way. Killing him wasn't their intention—first, that person's words; second, their identities. Luo Tian was far beneath them.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded quickly, pointing his finger and releasing three drops of essence blood, radiating divine energy. They landed before the two men.

"Go, don't cause trouble. This is our territory!" The black and white middle-aged men spoke softly.

"Did this really end?" Hearing their words, Luo Tian's mind jolted. He hadn't expected it to end so easily; he had prepared for his skin to be peeled and his sinews pulled. Yet they let him go.

"Why?" Luo Tian's mind was puzzled. Normally, hell cultivators would kill any heavenly realm disciples, especially ghosts.

"Did you want more? Do you really think we'd throw you into the Yellow Spring?" Seeing Luo Tian's expression, they became annoyed and glared at him.

"Thank you, respected elders! You're paragons of virtue and artistry; models for all cultivators. Truly, you are masters of the world!" Luo Tian spoke again, his voice filled with respect.

"Go..." The two men waved their hands, and Luo Tian's figure vanished from the hall, being flung out.

"Is that person...?" Luo Tian disappeared from the hall; the two men looked at the three drops of essence blood in their hands, their eyes filled with contemplation.

"Reincarnation Blood! I might be able to..." They exchanged glances, then swallowed the essence blood Luo Tian left behind. Sitting on the ground, they radiated waves of energy.

...

In a small courtyard on the ninety-ninth layer, Zhang Tian wore a relaxed expression as he stepped out of his room. He changed into clean clothes to visit his neighbors, wanting to inquire about recent events in the Turnaround Palace.

"Ah! Though there were some setbacks, it's still perfect! That star of destruction, Luo Chen, is dead!" Zhang Tian smiled inwardly.

As Zhang Tian just stepped out of the courtyard, a black vortex appeared above his head, and a dark figure descended from the sky.

"Move aside!" A loud voice echoed in Zhang Tian's ears, making his body tremble.

"Who is this voice so familiar?" Zhang Tian looked puzzled before feeling the weight of a mountain on his body.

"Boom..." Dust flew, and Zhang Tian was crushed into a human cushion, hit by the descending figure. He fell face-first.

"Spit..."

"Dammit, no matter who you are, I'll kill you!" Zhang Tian cursed loudly, his voice filled with anger.

The descending figure wasn't anyone else but Luo Tian, who had been flung by the two men. They had intentionally made him suffer, restricting his cultivation.

"Was it necessary?" Luo Tian stood up, gazing at the black sky with a委屈 expression.

"Sorry, I didn't mean to!" Luo Tian said, standing up and addressing Zhang Tian.

"You..." Zhang Tian stood up, gazing at Luo Tian before the words were even out of his mouth. His face turned grim, eyes wide open, speechless.

"It's you!" Luo Tian's eyes lit up slightly, a brief surprise flashing before he recognized himself.

"You... how are you still alive?"

"This is impossible! This absolutely can't be right. Tianluo Poison couldn't kill you—there must be a ghost! Right, this is the Reincarnation Hell. You must have escaped from it!" Zhang Tian shouted, his voice trembling.

"Ha! We really are destined to meet!" Luo Tian felt a deep connection with Zhang Tian.

"Everything can be stolen; I'll steal you first!" Luo Tian laughed, pulling down his sword and swinging it toward Zhang Tian.

"Buzz..." The sword cut through the air, slamming toward Zhang Tian.

"Dammit, he's not dead!" Zhang Tian's face turned grim; he formed a hand sign, creating a black barrier in front of himself.

"Boom..." The black barrier shattered like paper before Longyuan Sword, and the sword's body directly struck Zhang Tian's body.

Zhang Tian was flung backward, spitting blood continuously.

"Boom..." Zhang Tian's body collapsed on the ground, his eyes still filled with shock.

"Zhang Tian!" Luo Tian stepped forward toward Zhang Tian's direction, carrying his sword on his shoulder, a smile on his face.

As he walked, Luo Tian pointed his finger, and seals appeared, instantly sealing Zhang Tian's cultivation.

"What do you want? I was under the protection of Master Wan Tianyi!" Zhang Tian, sealed in cultivation, looked terrified, fearing Luo Tian would kill him. He immediately mentioned all his backdoors.

"Ah! So what?" Luo Tian's face grabbed, approaching Zhang Tian and snatching the storage ring from his finger.

"You..." Seeing his storage ring taken, Zhang Tian's heart jolted.

"If you let me go, this ring is yours!" Zhang Tian's face showed bitterness; the ring wasn't his entire savings. Most of his savings had been extorted by Luo Tian before.

A strong spiritual sense entered the storage ring, and Luo Tian slightly frowned. In the storage ring, he found less than ten thousand ghost crystals and a few inferior ghost weapons.

"Truly poor..." Luo Tian tossed the ring, throwing it to the ground like trash.

"You're not even paying back what you stole before!" Zhang Tian's heart shouted, but he was also overjoyed.

"Do you mean Master Wan Tianyi is rich?" Luo Tian then asked, his eyes glowing with excitement. A plan formed in his mind.

"Robbery! Let's rob all the disciples of the Turnaround Palace, and with so much resources, I can reach the late True Immortal stage—or even peak!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile.

"After all, the two elders only said not to cause trouble. If others bother me, that's another matter!" Luo Tian thought, gazing at Zhang Tian.

Chapter 2128: Do You Want to Rise? ()

"Zhang Tian, do you want to rise?" Luo Tian addressed Zhang Tian, his voice laced with temptation.

"What?" Zhang Tian felt a shiver upon seeing Luo Tian's eyes, but he was truly afraid of Luo Tian now. This person had survived even the Tianluo Poison.

"I asked if you want to, why so many words!" Luo Tian swung his sword at Zhang Tian's body, making him shiver. He feared Luo Tian hadn't controlled the power and would kill him.

"Yes..." Seeing Luo Tian's dangerous eyes, Zhang Tian knew if he answered no, Luo Tian would kill him.

Zhang Tian wasn't foolish; he knew Luo Tian wouldn't kill him, perhaps because he had some value. Otherwise, after the things he did with Luo Tian, he would have killed Luo Tian already.

"That's good. Follow me; you don't need to do anything—just spread some messages. Earning ten thousand ghost crystals daily isn't a dream!" Luo Tian addressed Zhang Tian.

"What, what messages?" Zhang Tian trembled as he stood up, sensing Luo Tian's plan was beyond his imagination.

"Good, you have potential; I believe in you!" Luo Tian patted Zhang Tian's shoulder, speaking softly and explaining his plan to him.

"This... won't work!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zhang Tian's face turned grim, shaking his head.

"Don't tell me it won't work! Men can't say no. If you don't try, how do you know it won't work? Besides, I'll always be your strong support!" Luo Tian pounded Zhang Tian's shoulder heavily, causing him to spit blood.

"It's okay, okay! Don't hit me anymore; you'll kill me!" Zhang Tian shouted, his voice filled with frustration.

Zhang Tian had already given up; if he didn't agree to Luo Tian's request, Luo Tian might kill him.

"Alright, let's rest and recover. Later, we'll start our business!" Luo Tian laughed, then sat cross-legged. He had just lost three drops of essence blood to those two people and was quite injured.

Zhang Tian also sat cross-legged, his face filled with frustration. The courtyard became quiet as they meditated.

"He didn't kill me but left me. His strength has increased again; maybe he really can achieve what he said. Following him might truly lead to rising!"

Zhang Tian had been stunned by Luo Tian's actions. Now, thinking it over, he realized the benefits for him were great, and the cost was just clinging to Luo Tian's leg. If Luo Tian fell, he wouldn't fare well either.

"It's worth the risk!" Zhang Tian made a decision instantly, his eyes flashing with determination.

After an hour of recovery, they both stood up. Luo Tian wore a smile; he had taken so long to recover because he wanted Zhang Tian time to think. He needed a loyal person.

Anyone who entered the Turnaround Palace wasn't a fool. Luo Tian believed Zhang Tian understood the pros and cons.

"Luo Senior, the first sixty-six layers seem chaotic, but they aren't!" Zhang Tian addressed Luo Tian, his voice respectful. He had now positioned himself correctly.

"Speak up; I'm new here and don't know anything!" Luo Tian's brows relaxed, addressing Zhang Tian.

"The first sixty-six layers are where disciples live. If anyone could steal, it would have been chaotic!"

"In fact, each layer has a leader. These leaders are the most prosperous because daily resources flow to them. If you don't pay, you can't stay in the Turnaround Palace!"

"Because if you don't pay, you won't be protected by the leaders. Others can steal from you or gang up to rob you. Think about it—what path is left?" Zhang Tian spoke.

"Also, the leaders' relationships are complex. The outer thirty-three layers have inner disciples supporting them; inner disciples have elders backing them. This is why I think your plan won't work!" Zhang Tian continued, making Luo Tian's face show a smile.

"Don't worry; you just returned. You haven't heard of my past achievements. In terms of strength, who's my match? In terms of background, the Poison Sword Heavenly Lord Du Jianxing is my master; the Grandmaster is my elder. Who can be bigger than me?" Luo Tian smiled, boasting.

"Really?" Zhang Tian's face showed shock but then shook his head in disbelief.

"Alright, let's start with that Wan Tianyi fellow. Lead the way!" Luo Tian smiled and had Zhang Tian lead him, after all, his goal was to rob, rob, and rob until he reached the late True Immortal stage or even peak.

"Okay!" Zhang Tian nodded, secretly admiring Luo Tian's courage as he led him out of his courtyard.

"By the way, Zhang Tian, do you know what the Grandmaster of the Turnaround Palace looks like?" As they walked, Luo Tian asked.

"You just said the Grandmaster was your elder..." Zhang Tian thought to himself but showed respect when mentioning the Grandmaster.

"The Grandmaster is truly a master of the world. I heard we have two Grandmasters!"

"They aren't human; they're ghostly beings named Wuchang Ghosts, among the top in the ghost world. Only the Grandmaster exists in hell!"

"Because I heard long ago, the Grandmaster was one person. However, for some reason, he became like this now—two people can only merge briefly and achieve peak Immortal King strength."

"Ah, I see..." Luo Tian thought to himself, his heart shocked. He had confirmed the two people he saw earlier were the Turnaround Palace's Grandmasters, merged into one and comparable to peak Immortal King strength.

"They didn't kill me. My god, those two are definitely crazy—cultivating to split themselves into two, their minds must be messed up!" Luo Tian thought but didn't say it aloud.

As they spoke, Zhang Tian led Luo Tian to a courtyard. This courtyard was in the center of the ninety-ninth layer, with the most concentrated ghostly qi. It was also larger than other disciples' courtyards and had many Turnaround Palace disciples entering and exiting, all looking gloomy after leaving.

"Go!" Luo Tian patted Zhang Tian's shoulder, offering encouragement.

"Wan Tianyi, you bastard, come out! From now on, I'm in charge here!" Zhang Tian's face showed reluctance as he stood at the courtyard's entrance, shouting.

This shout used his full strength, like a thunderclap that made the courtyard's people pause.

"Zhang Tian, are you crazy?" People immediately saw Zhang Tian standing there and were surprised he dared to say such things.

"Who is Zhang Tian?"

"He's the one with the big sword, but I've never heard of him!" People whispered, watching Zhang Tian and Luo Tian.

"Wait... the one with the big sword... I remember someone!"

"Luo Chen! It's Luo Chen, who bloodied the Turnaround Palace's gates!" People suddenly gasped, gazing at Luo Tian standing there with a smile.

Though the incident had passed for a long time and gradually faded, Luo Chen's name was still spread.

"He's Luo Chen! If not for that, I almost forgot there was such a person in the ninety-ninth layer!"

"Are they going to attack Wan Tianyi?" People were stunned, their eyes filled with excitement.

In the large room of the courtyard, a young man sat on a black chair made entirely of ghost crystals. It was clearly not an ordinary item.

This young man was Wan Tianyi, the leader of the ninety-ninth layer. No one dared defy his will.

Recently, Wan Tianyi had heard about Luo Tian's story. Originally, as a new arrival, he should have gone to Luo Tian to intimidate and demand protection fees.

However, Luo Tian's ferocity had made Wan Tianyi wary; he hadn't dared to provoke Luo Tian, secretly relieved they had remained peaceful.

Wan Tianyi never expected that after so many days, Luo Tian would come to him himself. This was beyond his expectations.

Luo Tian's strength terrified Wan Tianyi; after all, he had killed even late True Immortals. Though Wan Tianyi had some strength, he was definitely no match for Luo Tian.

"What to do? What to do?" Wan Tianyi's face broke out in cold sweat, but Zhang Tian's voice outside made him break his composure.

"Zhang Tian, you're overstepping!" Wan Tianyi finally couldn't sit still and rushed out of the courtyard.

"Out! Master Wan Tianyi has come out!" The people's faces showed astonishment.

"Luo Senior, what wind brought you here?" As soon as he appeared, Wan Tianyi's face changed, his expression showing a slight smile.

"Alright, from today on, I'll protect the ninety-ninth layer. Hand over your resources to me; otherwise, I'll take them myself!" Luo Tian took down his sword and swung it twice, addressing Wan Tianyi.

"This..." Wan Tianyi's face slightly changed, gazing at Luo Tian before biting his lip: "Luo Senior, you know I can't control this..."

Chapter 2129: Sweep ()

Everyone's faces showed disbelief at Wan Tianyi, surprised he had immediately submitted without any resistance. No one dared to confront Luo Tian directly.

But they knew Luo Tian could kill even late True Immortals, and no one in the first sixty-six layers could match him except a few top talents.

"Ah, then don't give it to me? From now on, everything goes to me. Got it?" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with disdain.

"Luo Senior, this is beyond my control..." Wan Tianyi spoke, his voice filled with frustration.

"Don't talk nonsense! I ask you—give or not give? If not, today I'll beat it out of you!" Luo Tian swung his sword twice, making the surrounding people tremble. Some had clearly seen Luo Tian kill many with one swing.

"I... give..." Wan Tianyi immediately submitted, his face showing a smile like crying, handing his storage ring to Luo Tian.

"Tianhe, keep it; leave your share here. From now on, this courtyard's master is you!"

"From now on, the resources from the ninety-ninth layer can be reduced by ten percent! All go to Zhang Tian here!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with authority.

"Thank you, Luo Senior!" The disciples' faces showed excitement; though ten percent wasn't much, it was still a small benefit.

Zhang Tian's eyes were also excited; he hadn't expected that one sentence would make him the leader of the ninety-ninth layer.

Only Wan Tianyi's face showed a bitter smile; at this point, he had no choice but to hope his inner disciple's backer would come soon to resolve the issue.

"Wan Tianyi, I ask you—do you want to rise?" Luo Tian looked at Wan Tianyi's bitter face, his expression showing a slight smile.

"I..." Wan Tianyi's face slightly changed; seeing Luo Tian's eyes, he felt a bad premonition.

"Follow me and let you ascend one level, guarding the ninety-eighth layer. How about that?" Luo Tian spoke, his voice filled with a slight smile.

Wan Tianyi's face slightly changed; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to recruit him, but if he truly joined Luo Tian, his inner disciple's backer would definitely disagree.

"I refuse!" As Wan Tianyi didn't know how to answer Luo Tian, a cold voice echoed from outside the crowd. A figure pushed through the crowd and stepped forward.

A black robe, long flowing hair with jet-black strands, radiating a ruthless aura—clearly someone who had killed many. Luo Tian smelled the scent of blood on him.

"You're Luo Chen?" The black-haired youth's face showed coldness, stepping out of the crowd and scanning Luo Tian.

"Yu Senior!" Seeing the youth step forward, Wan Tianyi's face showed joy, as if he had found a savior.

"Yu Senior, you came at the perfect time! This Luo Chen is trying to steal my courtyard and even took my resources for you!" Wan Tianyi spoke loudly, immediately reporting Luo Tian.

"Yu Hongzhi, an inner disciple of the sixty-sixth layer. Even among the sixty-six layers, he's well-known; his strength ranks in the top hundred. He is Wan Tianyi's backer. As for who Yu Hongzhi's elder is, I don't know!" Zhang Tian transmitted to Luo Tian, standing behind him.

"This will be a good show; one is an inner disciple's veteran strength, Yu Hongzhi, and the other is a rising star in the Turnaround Palace, Luo Chen!" People's eyes showed excitement. If Luo Tian defeated Yu Hongzhi, he would truly establish himself in the Turnaround Palace.

"I am Luo Chen. What do you need?" Luo Tian nodded, gazing at Yu Hongzhi and responding. He still had that indifferent tone.

"I was about to find you, but you've come to provoke me directly!" Yu Hongzhi's face showed coldness, raising his hand and a crescent moon sword appearing in it.
