“By the heavens, wait for me!” Diao Dezhù thrust his hands behind his back, gazing with an overwhelming gaze at the sect masters of the Central Three Heavens. Though his cultivation was merely half-step Immortal King, the aura he radiated left those masters stunned. Yet soon after, he returned to the slowly opening warship, his face etched with resentment as he glared at Luo Tian.

“Enough—there’ll be a time for you to gloat!” Luo Tian could not help but speak, sensing that the Tianyuan Sect would soon become a whirlwind of excitement.

“Finally gathered!” Luo Tian’s eyes brimmed with emotion as he gazed at his old brothers, the first time they had all met in the Immortal Realm. The warship drifted away—a beginning for the entire Tianyuan Sect, a new journey.

Other sect masters watched Luo Tian and his companions drift toward the Central Three Heavens, knowing from that moment on, the Immortal Realm would have a new powerhouse. Time flowed steadily; after half a month, Tianyuan Sect’s disciples arrived at the Central Three Heavens. Upon landing, they erupted into a long cheer.

“This is the Central Three Heavens?” The disciples cheered on the shore, scaring the cultivators preparing to explore the Huantian Sea into trembling. Two hundred thousand people obscured the sky, and after half a month of rest, all of Tianyuan Sect’s disciples—including Luo Tian—had nearly recovered from their visible wounds. The remaining task was to restore their energy.

“On to the Tianshan Valley!” Without hesitation, they sailed their warship toward the former Tianshan Valley. There was no trace of fear; now, Tianyuan Sect had the right to roam freely in the Central Three Heavens.

A dark cloud of people flew across the sky, their formation impeccable. After the Struggle for Heaven battle, Tianyuan Sect’s unity was formidable; their aura swept across the heavens.

“Who are these people?” The sudden arrival of such a group caused an uproar across the Central Three Heavens, as people murmured in astonishment.

Tianyuan Sect… this name echoed throughout the Central Three Heavens that day. Simultaneously, all of the Lower Three Heavens’ old and weak members of Tianyuan Sect set out to join their brethren. The people of the Lower Three Heavens were also invigorated, with sect masters exclaiming in disbelief.

Defeating the Central Three Heavens’ second-ranked Tianshan Valley—this was deemed impossible by all, yet Tianyuan Sect had achieved it. At that moment, no one could rival Tianyuan Sect except the Nine Immortal Mountains. The Central and Lower Three Heavens buzzed with discussion about this miraculous sect, which had succeeded in the Struggle for Heaven despite being underestimated.

After seven days of flight, two hundred thousand disciples finally reached the site of the former Tianshan Valley. Towering peaks stood tall, their air thick with Immortal essence. Pavilion and pavilion lined the landscape, yet it was desolate.

The remaining old and weak of Tianshan Valley had already evacuated entirely, leaving the valley to Tianyuan Sect. As for where Tianshan Valley had gone, some sects took interest—after all, as the second-ranked sect, Tianshan Valley’s resources were a vast number. Now that it had been annihilated, other sects eyed it greedily; Tianshan Valley could not have avoided making enemies.

Yet Luo Tian and his companions did not concern themselves with this. After all, what remained of Tianshan Valley were the weak and infirm; their conflict with Tianyuan Sect had been forced, and there was no need to exterminate them completely.

“From now on, this is our home!” Luo Tian’s face bore a wistful expression as he murmured to himself, “One day, we shall ascend to the Upper Three Heavens!”

Cheers erupted as Tianyuan Sect’s disciples, guided by Nan Gong Yuqing and others, rushed into the Tianshan Valley. While Tianyuan Sect was bustling with construction, several sects were thrown into disarray.

“Hongchen Sect’s Ancestor, Meng Hongchen has vanished… Duanlong Sect’s Master has disappeared…”

“Everyone perished in the Struggle for Heaven battle!”

“The Nine Immortal Mountains—East Emperor Mountain, Fu Tianhan Immortal King at the middle stage perished; Fu Tiankui fell; Yongsheng Mountain’s Nie Yuntian was slain!” The Central Three Heavens erupted in discussion. After all, the death of an Immortal King was felt by other Immortal Kings.

“Struggle for Heaven Battle! Has Tianyuan Sect gone mad, killing even the Nine Immortal Mountains’ masters?” The Central Three Heavens were in chaos, immediately associating it with the Struggle for Heaven Battle—after all, the timing of their deaths coincided.

“Perhaps it was more difficult than we imagined; even several Immortal Mountains sent their strength to stop us!”

“Hear, Tianyuan Sect has captured three monks—strong disciples of Xumi Mountain. My heavens!”

“This Struggle for Heaven Battle has cost so many Immortal Kings!” Everyone was stunned, marveling at Tianyuan Sect’s might. Luo Tian’s feat of defeating Fu Tianhan and three others was spread, making his name echo again in the Central Three Heavens.

“How did he manage it?” Everyone was puzzled, deeming it impossible. They believed Luo Tian must have possessed some formidable technique.

This event made people realize that the most terrifying aspect of Tianyuan Sect was not its three middle-stage Immortal Kings, but Luo Tian. This story spread for a month before finally calming down, and in that time, Tianyuan Sect was fully established.

……

“Hmph…” Luo Tian sat cross-legged in a serene courtyard, having recovered after a month. His injuries had finally healed.

“His cultivation has improved significantly!” Luo Tian’s eyes reflected admiration; after a battle, one's cultivation often benefited greatly. Especially since he had obtained the complete Heart Demon Classic, his training speed was far faster than before.

Luo Tian stepped out of the tranquil courtyard with a smile, gazing at the bustling disciples of Tianyuan Sect. His heart was unusually calm.

“Tianyuan Sect!” As he walked, his expression changed. He noticed that the rebuilt Tianyuan Sect’s structures were eerily similar to those of Jiuyu’s Five Elements Sect.

“This is the Dan Pavilion, this is Jinfeng’s appearance… This is Danfeng…” Luo Tian secretly felt delighted. As he walked through Tianyuan Sect, memories surged like a spring.

“Respectfully greet Master Luo!” Upon seeing Luo Tian emerge, the disciples of Tianyuan Sect immediately became fervent. To them, he was a godlike figure.

“Luo Tian, come quickly!” A voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. Unlike others who were reluctant to be sect master, Diao Dezhù took the role seriously, doing everything himself with joy.

Luo Tian chuckled and headed toward the grand hall of Tianyuan Sect. After a quarter-hour, he stepped into the hall.

At that moment, only Meng Wushuang, Lu Chong, and Zhang Chenglong were absent.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Tian looked at the many people in the hall, his face showing confusion.

“Luo Tian, sit down!” Diao Dezhù regarded Luo Tian solemnly and spoke.

“Go on, don’t act so smug. There are no disciples here!” Luo Tian could not help but curse, pulling a chair and sitting down.

“Your grandfather!”

“There are two matters: one is how to deal with those three monks, and the other is that in a few days, the Nine Immortal Mountains will send people to recruit us. What do you think we should choose?” Diao Dezhù spoke, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Need I think? Of course it’s Buxian Mountain!” Luo Tian scowled, not hesitating. Buxian Immortal King had treated him kindly; how could he be ungrateful?

“But don’t forget, I heard before that you have two wives in Hongchi!” Diao Dezhù scowled.

“Uh…” Luo Tian was momentarily stunned, understanding immediately. A sense of guilt washed over him. He had heard that Sun Menru and Jiang Sisi were in Hongchi, but he had been too busy to find them.

“This really is a dilemma,” Luo Tian said, hearing Wan Lingkong’s words. “We’ve caused such a stir; it was inevitable to draw the Nine Immortal Mountains’ attention. Sisi and Meng Ru must have known by now; they might already be on their way to Tianyuan Sect.”

Gu Qianxue spoke softly, her gaze filled with amusement as she looked at Luo Tian.

“This… you decide,” Luo Tian said loudly. “I can’t let my personal feelings hinder Tianyuan Sect’s future.”

“Among us, many are single. I heard Hongchi Mountain is full of beauties. If we join Hongchi, wouldn’t our personal issues be solved?” Wan Lingkong spoke loudly, his gaze on Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue. The hall had only this couple.

“This… really is a dilemma!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with hesitation upon hearing Wan Lingkong.

“Luo Tian, you bastard, come out!” As the group discussed, a clear voice echoed in the sky above Tianyuan Sect. Hearing this sound, Luo Tian instinctively shivered, a chill rising at his waist.

“This voice… familiar,” Diao Dezhù’s eyes flickered, and he immediately led the way out of the hall.

Chapter 2414: Struggle for Supremacy

Above Tianyuan Sect, several figures stood there like immortals, making the sky pale in comparison. Their robes fluttered as they gazed toward Tianyuan Sect. Two of them looked down at the entire sect, their bodies trembling with excitement.

“Who are these people? So beautiful! My heavens, are they immortals?” The disciples of Tianyuan Sect were instantly stunned, gazing at the figures in the sky as if they hadn’t heard the women’s previous scolding.

“Wife!” As the disciples of Tianyuan Sect were stunned, a loud shout echoed. A streak of light shot up and instantly reached the women.

“Master Luo!”

“Wife?” This loud shout made the disciples of Tianyuan Sect snap out of their stupor, gazing in bewilderment at Luo Tian standing in the sky.

“I’ve missed you so much!” Luo Tian immediately wrapped his arms around Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru, whispering into their ears. The two women trembled at his embrace but did not struggle.

A warm atmosphere spread through the sky, making people reluctant to disrupt it.

“Too beastly! Having Qianxue, yet still having two more!”
“Luo Tian Master isn’t human; he’s a god. What does it matter if he has two more beauties?” The disciples of Tianyuan Sect immediately started murmuring.

Hearing the people’s murmurs, Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru blushed. Their hands immediately reached for Luo Tian’s waist and twisted fiercely.

“Yowch…” A scream echoed in the sky, making people shiver with fear.

“Go…!” Jiang Sisi coldly spoke. Among Luo Tian’s wives, Jiang Sisi was the leader.

Jiang Sisi kicked Luo Tian fiercely, sending him crashing into the ground like a meteor.

“Crack…” The stone ground cracked, kicking up clouds of dust. People’s mouths twitched.

“Sisi, this is the one you called a heartless man? Sister-in-law help me teach him a lesson!” Before Jiang Sisi could speak, another woman stepped forward, her gaze unkind as she looked at Luo Tian standing up from the ground. Her long black hair flowed, wearing a淡 blue robe with a golden sash around her waist, highlighting her slender figure. Her face was elegant, especially her water-blue eyes, giving a fresh feeling.

“Huh…” A blue sword appeared in the woman’s hand. She leapt down, and a淡 blue barrier formed around her, descending like a celestial maiden from the heavens. She thrust her sword toward Luo Tian.

“Immortal King!” The disciples of Tianyuan Sect gasped, watching the woman descending from the sky. They hadn’t expected such a beautiful woman to possess such formidable strength.

“Not only that, there’s another Immortal King!” Diao Dezhù looked at the other women standing above and whispered.

With Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru, five had arrived—three half-step Immortal Kings and two early-stage Immortal Kings. As Luo Tian got up, the woman’s sword was already near him, causing his eyes to narrow. Longyuan materialized in his hand and he blocked it.

“Squeak…” Sparks flew as the blue sword struck Longyuan. Luo Tian’s body trembled, repelling the woman.

“Sister-in-law, no need…” Jiang Sisi quickly spoke to stop her. She knew Luo Tian well; among their sisters, there had been instances where they were captured by him.

Although her sister-in-law was here to avenge them, she didn’t want another sister-in-law to become a wife.

“It’s fine!” The woman in the淡 blue robe replied loudly. Seeing Luo Tian repel her, she rushed forward again.

“Clash…” A wave of sword shadows erupted, like water dragons, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Her sword art is very high!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. He felt this woman had reached the fourth level of sword art.

Luo Tian retreated, then unleashed his combined body and sword technique. The massive Longyuan sword expanded dramatically, slicing through the water dragons.

“Boom… boom…” Each wave of swords instantly disintegrated under Longyuan, like water swords, bursting into droplets that scattered outward.

“Sword Domain!” The woman’s eyes gleamed with determination as she raised her sword before her. A resounding sound echoed, imprinting a vast blue domain. It transformed into countless sword shadows, swirling within.

Sword energy erupted, sweeping toward Luo Tian and stirring the heavens. Yet it maintained a distance of over twelve hundred feet, as if the domain was another world.

“Very strong. No wonder she’s from Hongchi!” Diao Dezhù and others marveled, commenting on the woman within the domain without taking her seriously.

“Who among you likes her?” Diao Dezhù asked Nan Gong Yuqing and others.

“Can’t handle it. Can’t handle it!”

“This woman seems gentle, but her personality is fiery. One word and she draws the sword!” They shook their heads.

“Roar…” As they discussed, a roar echoed. Luo Tian finally activated his轮回 domain to counter the woman’s domain.

“Boom… boom…” Spiritual souls drifted above the domain, appearing eerie. Spiritual souls descended from the domain and collided with the sword energy. Both seemed endless but were actually a different kind of confrontation, testing spiritual awareness.

Each sword and soul required control to counter; thus, the consumption was immense.

“Sister-in-law, this guy’s spiritual awareness is strong!” Jiang Sisi spoke to the woman as they confronted.

“Strong. How much stronger can he be? Yue Yao daily focuses on Hongchi’s Xuanbing Yuxu Map to enhance spiritual awareness. She can endure three hours, showing her spiritual soul is unmatched!” Another woman spoke, one of the two early-stage Immortal Kings who had come with Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru. She wore a golden robe, her skin snow-white, with a pointed face. Her aura was formidable; even Jiang Sisi’s aura was no match for hers, giving an air of being unapproachable.

“Exactly. That Xuanbing Yuxu Map, I felt dizzy after just a minute; Yue Yao can endure three hours. She’s truly变态!” Another half-step Immortal King woman spoke, her voice carrying disdain as she looked at Luo Tian.

“Sigh…” Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru sighed longingly, no longer stopping them. Their hearts were uncomfortable, as these two spoke about their husband.

It felt like they had something taken away; others could say it was bad, but when their own said it was bad, they felt uncomfortable.

“Let Yue Yao have a taste of hardship!” Jiang Sisi whispered to Sun Mengru. Though she called these three sisters-in-law, her and Sun Mengru’s experiences were definitely beyond their reach.

The roaring continued as sword energy clashed with spiritual souls. Luo Tian also observed Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru’s eyes, noticing their anger had faded somewhat. He sighed in relief.

“Am I winning or not?” Luo Tian pondered, unsure whether to win. If he won, the two women’s anger wouldn’t be released; he might suffer more. If he lost and pretended to be injured, maybe the two wives would feel sorry for him.

“Lose!” Luo Tian made his decision instantly. He also pondered how long to lose—too short or too long was bad.

A incense’s worth of time passed. Luo Tian pondered, and the woman called Yue Yao, who was referred to as sister-in-law by Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru, had a pale face. Yet she gritted her teeth and persisted.

“Ugh… this is really a headache,” Luo Tian muttered, returning to his senses and seeing Yue Yao’s pale face.

“Roar…” Finally, Yue Yao made a mistake. Two sword shadows failed to block two spiritual souls, which rushed toward her.

“Stop…” Luo Tian quickly halted the two spiritual souls about to roar at Yue Yao’s face.

“Boom…” The pale blue domain shattered, and thousands of sword shadows turned into a storm in the sky before disintegrating.

“I… I haven’t used my full strength yet…” Luo Tian spoke, but immediately realized he had said the wrong thing.

“Again!” Yue Yao shouted, her blue sword erupting again. The domain enveloped everything once more—this time not thousands of swords, but a single sword to split the heavens.

“Yue Yao, enough. You’re not his match!” As the blue sword formed, another early-stage Immortal King woman finally spoke and flew down to block Yue Yao.

“Sister-in-law!” Yue Yao dispersed her sword, gazing at the woman who had blocked her. Her eyes showed confusion.

“I am Chen Min’ting from Hongchi,” the woman said, bowing to Luo Tian. “I’ve come to visit Tianyuan Sect.”

“Ah! That’s why they’re so beautiful!” The disciples of Tianyuan Sect immediately understood.

“I am…”
“Luo Tian, I am the sect master of Tianyuan Sect, Diao Dezhù. I’m sorry for not welcoming you properly!”
“I am a sect elder of Tianyuan Sect, Fu Xingyue. I’m sorry for not welcoming you properly…” Before Luo Tian could respond, Diao Dezhù and others quickly spoke, looking at Luo Tian with a defensive expression.

“Damn it, Fu Xingyue, you’ve already got so many wives. Why are you coming up here?”
“Ugh… it’s a habit…” Everyone immediately started fighting.
Luo Tian blushed, feeling embarrassed. He looked at these lovesick guys and cursed inwardly.

“Everyone, be quiet!” Jiang Sisi finally couldn’t stand it and shouted. Diao Dezhù and others immediately straightened up, reacting almost instinctively.

Chapter 2415: Representatives from the Major Immortal Mountains

People were momentarily stunned, gazing at Jiang Sisi standing there. She had once been the sect master of Tianyuan Sect, and all matters were under her control. These guys had often been disciplined by her, so they held a deep respect for her.

“Wait… I am the sect master of Tianyuan Sect!” Diao Dezhù realized and pushed his hands behind him, gazing at Jiang Sisi. However, his aura immediately weakened.

“Sisi sister, Mengru, it’s been a long time!” Gu Qianxue smiled and approached Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru.

“Qianxue, why are you here? You should be in Guiwang Sect!”
“We were planning to visit Guiwang Sect to see you!” Sun Mengru exclaimed, her face filled with joy.
“This is a long story. Let’s go in and talk slowly!” Gu Qianxue smiled, chatting with Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru.

Gu Qianxue embraced Jiang Sisi and Sun Mengru, greeting Yue Yao and Chen Min’ting. They entered Tianyuan Sect.

“This means we have no role here?” Diao Dezhù and others were stunned, watching the women chatter away. They muttered softly.

“Alright, I guess these three girls will stay here for a while. You’ll have plenty of chances!” Luo Tian sighed, turning toward his courtyard.

“Luo Tian, make sure you don’t lay a hand on her!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Diao Dezhù and others immediately became alert.

“Right! Fire prevention and theft protection—watch out for Luo Tian!” They all agreed. Finally, after Luo Tian swore he wouldn’t go out these days and would avoid them if he saw the three, they let him go.

“Chen Min’ting, no one can take her from me!” Wan Lingkong shouted loudly. Cold personalities like Chen Min’ting were the most attractive to men’s desire for conquest.

Days returned to peace, but the only thing that annoyed Luo Tian was these days. He couldn’t get close to Sun Mengru and Jiang Sisi, even Gu Qianxue was taken by them.

During these days, Tianyuan Sect gradually became lively because Diao Dezhù had already spread the news that Tianyuan Sect would hold an opening ceremony in the Central Three Heavens.

The masters of various sects in the Central Three Heavens arrived, for now Tianyuan Sect was at its peak—undoubtedly the top sect in the Central Three Heavens. No one could challenge it.

Diao Dezhù was busy, arranging each master properly.

Time flowed steadily until the day of Tianyuan Sect’s opening ceremony. A spacious platform rose from the ground, and masters of ninety-nine sects sat there.

“Master, go on. Give a speech!” Luo Tian and others smiled, watching Diao Dezhù excitedly.

“Good!” Diao Dezhù shook his purple robe, walking with a dragon-like gait toward the platform. His aura radiated power, reaching for the heavens.

“Welcome all to my Tianyuan Sect’s opening ceremony!” Diao Dezhù spoke, his voice imbued with a strange magic. The ninety-nine sect masters below stopped their chatter.

“Also welcome the immortals from Hongchi. Let Tianyuan Sect shine!” Diao Dezhù continued, explaining the rules of Tianyuan Sect.

He spoke for half an hour without stopping. At first, people listened attentively, but later they became impatient, watching Diao Dezhù spew saliva. However, due to his position as the sect master of Tianyuan Sect, they dared not say anything.

“Kid, make him stop or I’ll go up and punch him!” Ye Wudao’s angry voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

At that moment, Ye Wudao and his son Ye Liangchen sat on the platform with the Hongchi women. After all, Xinghe Fu had a great debt to Tianyuan Sect.

Luo Tian had previously wanted the three elders of Shenglong Sect to come up, but they refused.

Tianyuan Sect’s emergence had also increased Shenglong Sect’s status in the Central Three Heavens. After all, everyone knew that Shenglong Sect’s former young sect master was Luo Tian.

“Diao Dezhù, stop! If you don’t stop, we won’t give you face!” Luo Tian transmitted to Diao Dezhù, who was still speaking proudly.

“Just a little longer. Two more hours and it’s done. I have preparations!” Diao Dezhù replied, making Luo Tian’s mouth twitch.

“If you don’t stop, I’ll have Run Hongyu use a needle to prick you!” Luo Tian threatened. Not even two hours, they couldn’t endure it.

Hearing the mention of Run Hongyu’s silver needles, Diao Dezhù shivered. He cleared his throat: “Well, I’ll stop here. I promise that any past conflicts between Tianyuan Sect and the esteemed masters present will be erased from today!”

Hearing Diao Dezhù’s words, many of the ninety-nine sect masters sighed in relief. Among them were those who had conflicts with Luo Tian; they had come with generous gifts to clear up misunderstandings.

“Of course, if there are any new conflicts, Tianyuan Sect is not someone to be messed with. I hope everyone will take care of themselves!” Diao Dezhù emphasized again.

“Alright, that’s it!” Diao Dezhù bowed to the crowd.

“Applause…” As soon as Diao Dezhù’s words ended, thunderous applause erupted. The masters’ faces were filled with excitement, as if they had been liberated.

“Did I come late?” As Diao Dezhù walked toward Luo Tian and others, a long laugh echoed. Five figures sliced through the sky from above.

Five figures radiated powerful energy. The leader, a man in white robes with a long sword on his back and a gourd at his waist, was Jiang Taibai.

Behind Jiang Taibai stood three figures—Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen, as well as Xuan Dan.

“Respectfully greet Elder Jiang of Yongsheng Mountain!” The masters immediately stood up, gazing at Jiang Taibai with respect.

“Little Tian!” Zhang Ziping and the others looked at Luo Tian, who had stood up. They knew how difficult it was for Luo Tian to reach this point.

“Senior Brother!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Zhang Ziping and the others.

“Senior Brother, I’m sorry for not helping you!” Zhang Ziping spoke, his voice filled with guilt. He didn’t know that Tianshan Valley had advanced the Struggle for Heaven battle.

He only received news after Tianyuan Sect had succeeded in the Struggle for Heaven and Luo Tian’s matters were already over.

“Senior Brother, don’t say that!” Luo Tian didn’t intend to let Zhang Ziping and the others join Tianyuan Sect. After all, they had another identity—Disciples of the Dao Sect!

“Elder Jiang, please sit!” Diao Dezhù welcomed Jiang Taibai and sat with Ye Wudao and others.

“Has Tianyuan Sect prepared a seat for Guiwang Sect?”
“East Emperor Mountain has arrived to pay respects!”
“Yongsheng Mountain has come to congratulate Tianyuan Sect on its opening!”
“Buddha’s mercy…” As Diao Dezhù just seated Jiang Taibai, voices echoed from four directions.

Numerous figures soared through the sky, their attire varied and their auras formidable. They appeared above Tianyuan Sect.

“Representatives from the major Immortal Mountains have arrived!” The ninety-nine sect masters immediately stood up, gazing at the figures in the sky with respect.

“Strangers are not good!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, gazing at the East Emperor Mountain and Yongsheng Mountain.

Yongsheng Mountain’s representatives were two middle-aged men, both early-stage Immortal Kings. Their eyes were cold as they gazed at Luo Tian and others, but they did not act.

East Emperor Mountain had only sent one middle-stage Immortal King. His gaze at Luo Tian was filled with fleeting killing intent.

“Qianxue!” The most noticeable thing for Luo Tian was the Guiwang Sect’s direction. A middle-aged man in an Immortal King aura stood behind, followed by a young man and woman. The man was unknown to Luo Tian, but the woman he recognized.

“Where is my second self?” Gu Qianxue’s eyes flickered, spotting another Gu Qianxue sitting with Jiang Sisi and others.

“Come here. Let me merge!” The Gu Qianxue in black robes, radiating ghostly energy, coldly spoke. Her voice carried an order.

“Not now!” Gu Qianxue smiled softly. The other Gu Qianxue had not yet recovered her memories; if they merged, only one would remain.

“You’re seeking death!” Ghostly energy spread. Cold words echoed from Gu Qianxue’s mouth.

“Luo Master, we’ve met again. Do you have any interest in returning with me to Xumi Mountain? This is my master; his Buddhist wisdom is profound and will surely guide you onto the right path.” On another side, a bald young man clasped his hands and gazed at Luo Tian with kindness. This was Jie Du.

Beside him stood a fat monk, who gazed at Luo Tian and others with a smile. He always wore one.

“Everyone, what’s the matter? Is it after the ceremony today? I hope the esteemed guests from the Immortal Mountains won’t disturb!” Diao Dezhù spoke.

“You’re nothing. A mere half-step Immortal King, you have no right to speak with us. Get out!” However, as soon as Diao Dezhù’s words ended, a golden hand descended from the sky toward Diao Dezhù.

In an instant, the golden hand landed on Diao Dezhù’s head. His face slightly changed.

“Boom…” The golden fist instantly flew out, striking the golden hand and shattering it.

“He is my Tianyuan Sect’s sect master!” Luo Tian stood beside Diao Dezhù, gazing at the young man who had attacked him. This was from East Emperor Mountain.

“Kid, I heard Xumi Mountain has two more monks captured by you. I’ve come to demand their return!” The fat monk spoke, gazing at Luo Tian with a tone different from before.

“Our goal is simple: to recruit you!” Yongsheng Mountain’s strong one spoke, gazing at Luo Tian with a playful look.

Three Immortal Mountains spoke, pressing hard. The previously joyous atmosphere immediately solidified and became tense. People’s eyes were on Luo Tian and others, knowing these three Immortal Mountains had learned of Tianyuan Sect’s actions.

Chapter 2416: Seeing the Daoist Thunder Sword
