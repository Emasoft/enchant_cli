“Where are you?” Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying a note of solemnity as he scanned the surroundings.

“Damn it, I'm right here!” A voice responded, laced with impatience. Before the words had fully faded, Luo Tian felt a forceful impact against his leg, even through the Epoch Bell's protection. The searing pain sent him stumbling back a few steps.

After careful searching, Luo Tian finally located the source of the voice. His expression shifted dramatically, his lips twitching in amusement.

Before him stood a black ant, its body significantly larger than ordinary ants but still dwarfed by human proportions.

"Ha! You dare not kneel before my majesty? What's wrong with you, are you seeking death!" The black ant radiated golden light, with golden threads flowing across its body.

"Damn it, an ant has achieved sentience!" Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the tiny creature shouting at him.

"Quickly! You damned fool, it's rare to find a human. Take everything you have—recent luck has been good; this is the second human I've encountered in a short time. How long has it been since anyone came?" The ant bellowed, eyes scanning Luo Tian.

"Did you meet another human before? When?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. The cliff they'd entered was hidden, unlikely to be discovered by ordinary people.

"Recently, I've forgotten how many days. That human appeared like a divine being, but after arriving, he kept talking. I never expected such a person to exist—able to create pills that enhance strength, he's truly a god!" The ant spoke with reverence.

"Can you take me to meet him?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed further, eyes on the ant.

"No way! I'm here to rob. Our leader said whenever we meet a human, we must strip them of all treasures and deliver it to him for stronger pills!" The black ant declared.

"So, hand over your treasures or I'll be ruthless!" The ant's eyes darkened as it addressed Luo Tian, its tiny form still evoking a sense of unease.

Though small, the ant radiated immense power, its vitality at peak levels. As Luo Tian pondered, the black ant materialized before him and lunged.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. His golden fist swung, eager to test the ant's strength.

Two fists of vastly different sizes collided. The impact sent tremors through the bamboo forest.

"His flesh and bone are surprisingly strong! Even with my divine power, I couldn't repel him!" Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief as he retreated. The black ant, no larger than a fingernail, stood triumphant.

"Ha! You dare challenge me? Humans are still too weak. Even our leader can't match me. But you're strong—stronger than our leader!" The ant spoke.

"Considering your strength, I'll let you off this time," the ant said, as if granting a favor.

"Dao of Sealing Demons!" Luo Tian roared. Being looked down upon by an ant was unbearable.

"Ha! Still不服?!" The ant's tiny eyes blazed with battle spirit as it charged again.

The Dao of Sealing Demons clashed against the black fist. This time, Luo Tian didn't retreat but his fists cracked.

"Ugh..." The black figure cursed, retreating several zhangs away, toppling bamboo trees.

Divine power enveloped the ant's body, causing it to squeal. Yet, the overwhelming divine force was instantly dispersed by the ant's tremor.

Luo Tian's eyes widened in shock. His Dao of Sealing Demons had been effortlessly countered.

"You're quite interesting. As before, hand over your treasures and I'll spare you," the ant declared.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian sighed, his gaze contemplative. He knew subduing this tiny creature would cost him dearly.

Then he recalled the pills the ant mentioned earlier. His mind stirred with ideas.

"Wait!" Luo Tian raised a hand, halting the ant's next strike. He flipped his palm, revealing a fragrant pill—Sage-grade初级 (initial stage) medicine.

The pill's crystalline appearance and aroma marked it as top-tier. After brief contact, Luo Tian realized this ant was a robber but straightforward and naive. Though it cursed constantly, its inexperience was evident—likely imitating someone else's methods.

"Medicine!" The ant gasped, rushing toward the pill larger than itself. It snatched it, eyes glazed with ecstasy.

"You want this? I have more. If you take me to your leader, I'll give them all to you!" Luo Tian smiled cunningly, flipping his palm again. Five more pills floated in his hand.

Through some means, the ant swallowed the Sage-grade初级 pill. Its eyes gleamed with greed as it stared at the five pills.

"Better than what our leader gave me. You have so many!" The black ant's voice held inquiry.

"Of course, if you take me to that person or find a certain bamboo for me, I'll give you these pills—more even!" Luo Tian coaxed, like tricking a child.

"Fine. I feel it's too hard to rob you. Taking you to the clan isn't a problem, but don't speak recklessly!" The ant relented, unable to resist the temptation.

Hearing this, Luo Tian inwardly sneered: "I'll see who taught this naive ant such tricks!"

Luo Tian followed the ant deeper into the bamboo forest, forgetting his meeting time with Diao Yuanshan.

He was thrilled. This ant clearly acted as a local boss. With its and its clan's help, he'd quickly find the Immortal Life Bamboo.

As they journeyed, Luo Tian learned what the ant truly was—Star Dragon Ants. Their name's "dragon" origin came from their ancestors having slain dragons.

"Slain dragons?" When the ant explained, Luo Tian suddenly recalled the Epoch Master of this Valley who had slain countless dragons.

"Here!" As Luo Tian mused, the ant's voice echoed in his ears. He halted his thoughts, gazing at the ant clan.

Though numbering thousands, compared to modern great clans, their numbers were vastly fewer. When Luo Tian and the ant arrived, the Star Dragon Ants stirred. Black figures emerged, identical to the ant but with one difference—Luo Tian's companion had golden threads on its body, while others didn't. The ants gazed at it with reverence.

"What are you doing? So lively, has Yan Jun returned? Did he get something big?" As Luo Tian faced thousands of Star Dragon Ants, a leisurely voice echoed in his ears. He furrowed his brows, sensing familiarity.

"We're meeting our leader. Don't be disrespectful, or I'll suffer!" The ant named Yan Jun said respectfully.

"Ugh. What kind of scammer is this? How did they convince these ants to obey so completely!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with curiosity, gazing at the voice's source.

"Hey... Xu Liyi!" Luo Tian's face lit up as he saw the person. He flashed toward the youth.

"God, Luo Tian! I've finally seen a living person!" The youth roared, joy in his voice. Two fists collided between the two amidst thousands of ants.

"Why are you here?" Luo Tian asked, surprised to meet Xu Liyi here.

"Where did you come from?" Xu Liyi's eyes widened, concern in them.

"I'm searching for the Immortal Life Bamboo. You were sent to the Demon Region by Wan Lingkong, how did you end up here in the Dragon-Devastated Valley?" Luo Tian's eyes held confusion.

"Stop mentioning Wan Lingkong! When I get out, I'll peel his skin!" Xu Liyi's voice rose as he was reminded of the transport incident.

Luo Tian watched in silence, amusement in his eyes. Finding Xu Liyi's whereabouts here was a relief.

"Okay, tell me how you got here!" Luo Tian smiled, interrupting Xu Liyi's rant.

"What else? I fell directly into their ant nest. If it weren't for my pills, I'd have been killed by these Star Dragon Ants!" Xu Liyi said.

"Don't underestimate their strength. They're powerful. Do you know who they are? Descendants of the Epoch Master! Imagine their potential. Given time, one or two Epoch Masters will emerge!" Xu Liyi's eyes held admiration as he gazed at the thousands of ants, envisioning leading a few Epoch Masters to conquer great sects.

"Come on, little ones. This is my brother. You can call him leader!" Xu Liyi pulled Luo Tian, introducing him to the Star Dragon Ants.

"Leader... leader..." A black ant addressed Luo Tian, making him feel awkward.

"Alright, everyone. Have you seen the Immortal Life Bamboo?" Luo Tian asked directly, his purpose clear.

"The Immortal Life Bamboo?" Xu Liyi's brows furrowed, recalling.

"Is it very lively, green bamboo?" Yan Jun, the ant with golden threads on its back, asked Luo Tian.

"Yes! You told me before!" Luo Tian's eyes sparkled with hope, gazing at the black ant.

"I've seen two. But only from afar. There were two Blood Demon Glazed Wasp hives on it, so I didn't approach."

"Blood Demon Glazed Wasps?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed. He didn't know what they were.

"You just arrived here. You don't know the situation of this area. This bamboo forest has only two species: Star Dragon Ants and Blood Demon Glazed Wasps. They're enemies, each feeding on the other."

"The strongest among Star Dragon Ants is a queen comparable to a Sage Peak. Due to her nature, she can't leave here. Similarly, the strongest Blood Demon Glazed Wasp is a queen at Sage Peak, also unable to leave her hive. Thus, they've been fighting for ages—two masters at Sage Peak never fought directly." Xu Liyi explained the bamboo forest's situation.

"Sage Peak?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed. He could handle Sage Late, but Sage Peak was challenging.

"So they built their hives on the Immortal Life Bamboo. Besides, a queen at Sage Peak is beyond our ability to handle. Plus, thousands of Blood Demon Glazed Wasps are also a problem!" Xu Liyi sighed.

"We can't handle them, but someone can!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Xu Liyi. He wasn't alone.

"Who else came? Don't say Gu Lei or Zheng Xin—our group isn't enough for one of their clans!" Xu Liyi shook his head.

"Who said it's them? It's Master Diao who brought me here!" Luo Tian chuckled, his tone lighter.

"Haha! If Master Diao came, it's absolutely safe!" Xu Liyi laughed upon hearing Diao Yuanshan's arrival. With Master Diao, they'd be invincible in this bamboo forest.

"Let's go find Master Diao. He went the opposite direction. We agreed to meet five days later. I guess Master Diao might be anxious." Luo Tian addressed Xu Liyi.

Luo Tian and Xu Liyi left the ant clan, heading toward where they'd separated from Diao Yuanshan. Yan Jun also accompanied them.

They sped up, guided by Yan Jun, not getting lost. Along the way, Yan Jun introduced Luo Tian to the Star Dragon Ants, descendants of the Epoch Master.

Luo Tian marveled at how such a powerful lineage had fallen so low—only one queen at Sage Peak, no other strong ones.

Yan Jun was candid. In the era of celestial prodigies, Star Dragon Ants weren't rare; they were among the weakest beasts. Their ancestor's unique talent and bloodline mutation allowed them to become an Epoch Master.

"Everything has a spirit. Anyone, any beast, can achieve the Epoch Master!" Luo Tian's eyes held admiration.

"However, since an Epoch Master appeared, our Star Dragon Ants grew stronger. One force breaks all laws, reaching the peak of power. Though they won't become Epoch Masters, one or two at the Epoch level are possible—provided their bloodline is close to that of the original Epoch Master!" Yan Jun spoke confidently.

"Enough with the boasting. You just mean your bloodline is nearly as close to that original Epoch Master!" Xu Liyi mocked Yan Jun.

"By the way, transform into human form. It's uncomfortable to see you this small!" Xu Liyi said, impatience in his voice.

"Okay, leader!" Yan Jun obeyed Xu Liyi. Golden light radiated from his body, golden threads flowing through his tiny form.

"Can he transform into human form?" Luo Tian's eyes held confusion. He'd seen Yan Jun in ant form since first meeting, assuming it was his physique.

"Watch. You'll be shocked!" Xu Liyi smiled, watching Yan Jun transform.

"Wow..." Luo Tian's eyes widened in surprise, drawing a breath. Before him stood a man in black attire, perfect physique, long black hair flowing, handsome features with no flaws. His eyes, like black gems, radiated a lively energy, as if containing endless power.

"How's that? Scared? Though slightly inferior to me, he's still a handsome man!" Xu Liyi patted Luo Tian's shoulder, observing his surprise.

"Two leaders!" Yan Jun bowed to Luo Tian and Xu Liyi, swaying slightly, clearly uncomfortable.

Luo Tian had met many handsome men. Even himself, due to long-term cultivation, could be described as handsome. But among those he knew, only Jiang Nanxuan matched Yan Jun's beauty—different in气质, one calm and refined, the other like a volcano ready to erupt, carrying apocalyptic power.

"Let's go!" After admiring, the three continued their journey to where Luo Tian had separated from Diao Yuanshan.

"Not here?" Luo Tian frowned, seeing the empty bamboo forest. Diao Yuanshan wasn't waiting.

"According to Master Diao's strength, he should be the dominant force here. If they made an agreement, he'd definitely arrive!" Xu Liyi spoke, eyes filled with confusion.

"Boom... boom..." As Xu Liyi's words ended, a series of thunderous sounds echoed in their ears. The overwhelming energy made Yan Jun tremble.

"Did Master Diao see the Immortal Life Bamboo and acted on his own?" Luo Tian and Xu Liyi wondered, exchanging glances.

"Maybe. The location of the sound is where I first found those Blood Demon Glazed Wasps!" Yan Jun answered.

"Go!" The three exchanged glances, flashing toward the sound's direction.

Chapter 1095: Confrontation with Blood Demon Glazed Wasps

In the bamboo forest, Luo Tian, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun transformed into three streaks of light toward the location that had alarmed them.

The thunderous sounds grew louder as they approached, their hearts racing. Their speed slowed.

"Here!" After a day's flight, they were within a li of the sound. A li was just a few breaths for them.

But they dared not proceed further, as thousands of Blood Demon Glazed Wasps appeared before them. Larger than Star Dragon Ants, their most notable feature was the pair of blood-red wings and bodies like red glass.

Thousands of blood-red wasps surrounded an old man. His purple robe radiated confidence, with countless dead wasp bodies at his feet.

"Master Diao Yuanshan!" Luo Tian and Xu Liyi recognized the old man. Diao Yuanshan remained as powerful as ever, surrounded by purple qi, moving like a god. His hands struck repeatedly, forming massive purple hands that crushed hundreds of wasps each time. If the wasps weren't so fast, more would have died.

"Look there!" Yan Jun pointed to the wasps' midst. Two towering green bamboo stalks stood.

"Yes!" Luo Tian's face showed excitement, gazing at the two lush green bamboo stalks radiating intense vitality.

"Finally found it!" Luo Tian's heart was thrilled. With the Immortal Life Bamboo, he could craft Reincarnation Pills. If Chen Yunting agreed to follow him, everything would be easy.

But the two hives perched on the bamboo stalks made Luo Tian's heart jolt. The hives radiated intense energy that startled him.

"That's the Blood Demon Glazed Wasp hive. A queen at Sage Peak resides there!" Yan Jun spoke, his voice heavy.

"So many wasps dead. Why hasn't the queen emerged?" Xu Liyi asked, looking at Yan Jun.

"Probably soon!" Yan Jun's face also showed confusion. He didn't understand why the queen hadn't appeared.

"Master Luo, take this chance to cut down a bamboo. If I'm not mistaken, the queen is in the midst of a critical breakthrough! And she's aiming to ascend to the Epoch level!" Diao Yuanshan's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his heart tense.

"Buzz..." The wasps seemed mad, flying out of the hive toward Diao Yuanshan. Even he found them challenging.

"Humans, after my breakthrough, you'll all die!" A deep voice echoed from the hive. Cold and authoritative, it made Luo Tian's group tense instantly.

"The queen is breaking through! Leaders, don't let her complete it. If she does, not only will you fail to get the Immortal Life Bamboo, but our Star Dragon Ants will also perish!" Yan Jun's voice trembled as he heard the queen's words.

"Children, kill this human with your venomous stingers!" The queen's voice echoed again. The wasps, hearing her command, buzzed and their bodies glowed red.

"Buzz..." After the buzz, each wasp's tail sprouted a blood-red stinger, as if drained of all their blood.

"Blood Demon Glazed Wasps' stingers are suicidal attacks. Each can only use it once, and no one at the same level can withstand them—equivalent to a human's self-destruct attack!" Yan Jun's face changed, his voice filled with worry.

Yan Jun's words had barely finished when thousands of wasps flew out, their stingers launching toward Diao Yuanshan. The dense stingers enveloped him.

Diao Yuanshan's face turned serious as he formed purple light to protect himself.

"Quickly, these stingers are tricky. I'll need a while to escape. I can feel the queen's hive is almost complete! If she succeeds, even I'll have to flee or be killed!" Diao Yuanshan's voice echoed again, making Luo Tian's heart race.

After deploying the stingers, thousands of wasp corpses appeared before Luo Tian's group.

"A chance!" Luo Tian didn't think twice. His feet surged with wind, using the幽冥鬼步 (Yin Shadow Ghost Step) combined with梵天攻杀之术 (Buddha Heaven Attack Technique), instantly vanishing from Xu Liyi and Yan Jun's sight.

"Fast!" Yan Jun marveled, watching Luo Tian's speed. He couldn't see his figure, only seeing wasp corpses smashed by his extreme speed.

Luo Tian moved, appearing before the hive. He launched a fierce punch at it.

"Boom..." But his face suddenly changed. This punch used all his strength—Dao of Sealing Demons combined with Buddha Heaven Attack Technique, enough to kill a Sage Late. Yet it only made the hive tremble slightly.

"Can't do it!" Luo Tian's gaze turned to Diao Yuanshan, still surrounded by stingers. Though the stingers couldn't harm him, they kept him occupied.

"Kid, give up! My hive is a family heirloom passed down from our ancestors. Though not an Epoch Treasure, it's harder than a pseudo-Epoch Treasure!" The queen's voice echoed, laced with pride.

"Boom... boom..." Thunder rolled. Dark clouds gathered above the bamboo forest, instantly turning it dark.

"Rustle... rustle..." Wind blew, swaying the bamboo forest. A heavy pressure came from above, like a storm's prelude, making Luo Tian feel oppressed.

"Think of a way!" Luo Tian thought desperately how to break the crisis, his gaze filled with urgency.

"I'll try!" As Luo Tian pondered, Yan Jun's figure appeared before him. His fist turned emerald green and struck the hive.

Luo Tian had seen Yan Jun's strength. Even if he was just power, he couldn't beat Yan Jun. Now seeing Yan Jun use a Star Dragon Ant secret technique.

"Crack..." Thunder rolled. Yan Jun's fist struck the hive, making it tremble again.

"Can't do it!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Yan Jun's strength was strong, effective but only slightly better than himself. It knocked off a corner of the hive.

"What do wasps fear? Fire, probably!" Luo Tian's eyes held a moment of thought. He recalled when he was young, there was a common hive under his house. He and Chen Yunting burned it.

"Try! It's better to try than give up!" Luo Tian had no other ideas. He waved his hand, emitting a green flame that instantly enveloped the hive housing the queen.

As the green flame touched the hive, Luo Tian knew he was right. His eyes gleamed with joy.

Before him, intense flames burned the sturdy hive. The hive, which had withstood attacks from Luo Tian and Yan Jun, now seemed to have a weakness—slowly melting.

"Damn humans! Stop this damn heavenly fire!" A deep voice echoed, clearly furious.

"Rustle... rustle..." In an instant, the massive hive turned into fragrant liquid, flowing down to the roots of the Immortal Life Bamboo.

At the same time, a large Blood Demon Glazed Wasp appeared before Luo Tian's group. Though called "large," it was only as tall as Luo Tian's arm—much larger than other wasps, hundreds of times bigger.

The green flame enveloped the queen. Her blood-red eyes glared at Luo Tian, as if wanting to devour him alive.

"Damn it! I'll kill you, I'll kill you!" The queen roared in the green flame. Crazy and furious, but Luo Tian understood—she was at a critical stage of transformation. Now it seemed she wouldn't succeed, as the dark clouds above were slowly dispersing.

"Indeed, one thing defeats another!" Luo Tian watched the queen defeated by the green flame. His eyes held admiration.

Before, he'd never imagined he could trap a master at Sage Peak—perhaps even on the verge of becoming an Epoch Master.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian and his group marveled, the green flame suddenly moved. A blood-red figure flew out of the green flame, eventually transforming into a middle-aged man in red robes.

"You must die!" The man gritted his teeth, blood qi forming a blood-red sword. Without hesitation, he slashed toward Luo Tian's group.

"Run!" A sky-splitting blade cut through the heavens, instantly appearing before them. Their hearts trembled.

Chapter 1096: Battle at the Threshold of Epoch

In the bamboo forest, a blood-red blade sliced through the sky, slashing toward Luo Tian, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun.

Luo Tian and his group's faces changed. They gazed at the blood-red blade approaching, their hearts trembling with intense seriousness.

"Even without completing its transformation, this queen is at Sage Peak. We can't stop her!" Xu Liyi's eyes held bitterness, feeling as if he were targeted. In this strike, he couldn't resist.

Luo Tian was the same. Though he was extraordinary, even facing a Sage Late was fearless. But against a Sage Peak strike, he doubted his ability to withstand it.

"Even if we can't stop it, we'll die!" Luo Tian roared. His eyes showed madness. The Epoch Bell was summoned, enveloping the three.

"Unexpectedly, you have such a treasure!" The queen, now in red robes, showed a grimace. He gazed at the three enveloped by the Epoch Bell.

"Let's fight with everything we have!" Luo Tian addressed Xu Liyi and Yan Jun. His body's divine power concentrated in his fist, the Dao of Sealing Demons swung toward the approaching blade.

"Force breaks all laws!" Yan Jun also roared. He transformed into his true form, turning emerald green. His jade fist, though small, radiated immense power, striking the blade.

"Damn it! I'll fight!" Xu Liyi shouted wildly. His hands glowed gold, a streak of lightning flying from the Epoch Bell. It merged with the other two fists, striking the blood-red blade.

Though three were exceptional prodigies, they were still insufficient against a Sage Peak's furious strike.

The blood-red blade cut through stars and moon, colliding with the three's martial arts. The explosion echoed, sending waves that scattered a large bamboo forest, turning an area of hundreds of miles into a vacuum.

"Spit...!" The three spat blood, their eyes wide with shock. They were thrown back, colliding with the Epoch Bell's body.

"Boom..." The bell's sound echoed. The blood-red blade, like a sword of the Dao, struck the Epoch Bell's body with thunderous noise.

"Boom..." The three, who had just suffered heavy injuries, were further shaken by this explosion. Their bodies cracked, their faces pale as paper.

But with the three's full effort and the Epoch Bell's defense, they temporarily survived. However, they couldn't withstand another strike. If they faced that attack again, they'd surely die.

"Who dares to disrupt my business? You all must die!" The red-robed man's face still held killing intent. His blood-red sword slashed again, cutting through space toward the three.

"Think you're so important? Now I'll see who kills whom!" A cold voice echoed in their ears. Purple figures surged, overwhelming the queen with wild waves.

"Master Diao, if you don't come out now we're done!" Xu Liyi's face showed a bitter smile. He collapsed on the ground, breathing heavily. Pills were thrown into his mouth, his shattered body slowly recovering.

Luo Tian and Yan Jun weren't much better. They sat on the ground, eyes filled with shock. A Sage Peak's furious strike had nearly killed them, making them appreciate the power of a Sage Peak.

"My god, we've blocked the queen's strike. She's at the same level as our Star Dragon Ants' queen!" Yan Jun exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement.

"Shut up, you damned fool!" Xu Liyi slapped Yan Jun's tiny body. His face showed impatience.

"Humans, we have no grudge. Why disturb my peace and hinder my transformation?" The man in red robes, transformed from the wasp queen, roared at Diao Yuanshan.

"I just want one of those bamboos. If you don't give it to me, I can't do anything!" Diao Yuanshan waved his hand. The blood-red blade was caught in his grasp. That sky-splitting blade, which had nearly killed the three, dissolved into divine power from Diao Yuanshan's hand.

"You're strong. But to kill me... it's still hard!" The queen spoke, her aura flowing slowly. Her gaze at Diao Yuanshan showed strong fear and even a hint of retreat.
