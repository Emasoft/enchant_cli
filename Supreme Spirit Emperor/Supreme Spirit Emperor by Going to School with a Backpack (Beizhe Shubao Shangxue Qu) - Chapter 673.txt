At the moment of arrival, the heavens roared. Many individuals who had formed small teams from Bùtiān City to hunt ghostly creatures encountered this massive force and were crushed by it. However, such misfortunes were rare, for the battlefield was vast, and no one could be certain of their path through the Hellish army...

Bùtiān City's walls still had legions guarding them, and many people went to the battlefield to kill ghostly creatures in exchange for military merit. Yet these past days had seen many returning from outside the city, their faces marked with confusion.

"What's going on? Though ghostly creatures have appeared these days, not a single ghost cultivator has been seen!" Upon returning to the city, people began discussing this strange phenomenon, feeling utterly bewildered.

This odd occurrence soon reached the ears of Bùtiān City's Lord, Jiang Chen.

"What kind of strange event is this?" Jiang Chen felt something was amiss and immediately summoned the commanders. At present, Bùtiān City had undergone a complete transformation; most of the veteran commanders and thousand-commanders from Zhang Ziping's era had retreated to the second line, returning to Bùtiān Mountain.

"Lord, this indeed is strange. But there's no need to worry. Bùtiān Mountain has occupied Bùtiān City for countless years, and the ghostly creatures have never done anything. Even if there were a grand scheme, they could not break into Bùtiān City!" One commander spoke.

"Zhang Heng, things are not as simple as you imagine. History has seen instances where Bùtiān City was breached!" A middle-aged man spoke, and if Luotian's memory remained, he would recognize this man as Ke Duanshan.

Now, Ke Duanshan's aura was even more composed, clearly at the early stage of an Immortal King. At this level of cultivation, he could have returned to Bùtiān Mountain and held a high position as an elder. Yet Ke Duanshan had chosen to remain in Bùtiān City, even when several envoys from Bùtiān Mountain had come to urge him back, he refused.

"Commander Ke, what you said was the past. Bùtiān City now has a strong army and Lord Jiang's cultivation is already at the middle stage of an Immortal King. He alone could suppress these Hellish creatures!" Zhang Heng replied, clearly fawning.

"Lord Jiang, send someone out to investigate the city's outskirts!" Ke Duanshan addressed Jiang Chen. Having guarded against Hell for years, Ke Duanshan sensed something unusual.

"I'll consult the oracle first," Jiang Chen frowned slightly and began to count on his fingers.

"Alas!" Ke Duanshan sighed deeply in his heart. Having spent so many years in Bùtiān City, he knew Jiang Chen better than anyone. When Jiang Chen first arrived in Bùtiān City, he had been full of vigor, but over time, his character had changed. Out there, military orders were not to be questioned; now Jiang Chen was like a regional governor of Bùtiān Mountain, having become somewhat autocratic.

"Lord Jiang, if it truly was an attack, the enemy would certainly have obscured fate's omens!" Ke Duanshan spoke loudly. Among the eight commanders, only Ke Duanshan had the oldest rank.

"Commander Ke, are you questioning Lord Jiang's ability to divine fate?" Zhang Heng looked at Ke Duanshan.

Zhang Heng had been Jiang Chen's favorite for years, a sycophant. However, Ke Duanshan's rank and strength were superior to Zhang Heng's. Yet Zhang Heng knew Ke Duanshan's weakness—his high position had caused Jiang Chen to be wary. Ke Duanshan had strong influence among the soldiers, being second only to Jiang Chen.

Under Zhang Heng's constant provocation, Jiang Chen had become more wary of Ke Duanshan. Jiang Chen had begun to suppress him deliberately.

"Zhang Heng!" Ke Duanshan's face darkened. Zhang Heng was clearly provoking division, and this had been his way for years.

"Enough. I've consulted the oracle; there's no ominous sign, but we must remain vigilant. Zhang Heng, send two people out to investigate the city's outskirts; the ghost tide is about to arrive today!" Jiang Chen cleared his throat and addressed everyone.

"Our spies at the Gate of Heaven have not reported anything either. I believe it's safe. All the legions must be on high alert to prevent any unexpected incidents," Jiang Chen added, his voice carrying authority.

"Lord Jiang!" Ke Duanshan's face was grim. He had just begun to speak when Jiang Chen cut him off.

"Carry out my orders!" Jiang Chen's gaze fell on Ke Duanshan, a flicker of displeasure in his eyes.

"Yes!" Ke Duanshan sighed reluctantly and followed the other commanders to accept their orders. Zhang Heng's face was filled with smugness, a look of a petty man who had gained the upper hand.

As several commanders left the city lord's mansion, Ke Duanshan sighed deeply. Watching Zhang Heng walk away with smugness, he longed to strike him down.

"Senior Ke, is it really that serious?" A few commanders approached Ke Duanshan.

"Based on my years of guarding the Gate of Heaven, I believe this time the ghostly creatures at the Gate of Heaven are about to make a major move. With no ghost cultivators on the battlefield, they must have been recalled for assembly!"

"Unfortunately, Lord Jiang..." Ke Duanshan sighed again and did not continue. Some things were known in the heart, but saying them out loud was another matter.

"Order all your legions to be ready at any time!" Ke Duanshan spoke softly and walked toward the eighth legion.

"Senior Zhang, this time Commander Ke has suffered another setback," on another side, a few commanders surrounded Zhang Heng, watching Ke Duanshan leave in anger, whispering among themselves.

"One day I will be the first commander!" Zhang Heng's face was filled with smugness. As for sending someone to investigate, he hadn't even considered it. He knew Jiang Chen was merely giving Ke Duanshan a way out.

"Let's go to the city wall and take a look!" Zhang Heng's face was filled with smugness as he confidently ascended the wall. Today was his legion's turn to guard.

"Respectful greetings, Commander!" Each soldier bowed and paid homage, deepening Zhang Heng's smugness.

"Stay alert. When the ghost tide arrives, follow me to kill these creatures and gain merit!" Zhang Heng smiled, enjoying the reverence of the people around him.

Time passed slowly. Half a day had gone by when an oppressive atmosphere spread from outside Bùtiān City, and within the black mist, a series of roaring sounds echoed.

"They've come! Everyone prepare yourselves. Follow me out of the city!" Zhang Heng shouted, his spirit renewed as he approached the city gate.

Rumbling... As Zhang Heng's words fell, the earth trembled. A dark cloud surged forward, a cold wind blowing that made those on the city walls shiver involuntarily.

"What's happening?" Zhang Heng's face showed confusion as he gazed at the black mist. At that moment, Bùtiān City's gate opened, and soldiers from within the city rushed out toward the dark mist.

"Go..." Though Zhang Heng felt somewhat uneasy, he still led his sub-commanders out of Bùtiān City.

The endless dark cloud was advancing, it was the group that had attacked Bùtiān City three days ago from the Gate of Heaven, led by Luotian.

"Ha! It seems we can take it easily. Those fools didn't receive the news and still sent a single legion to meet them," seeing those who had rushed out of Bùtiān City, Wu Mian laughed instantly.

"Comrades, crush them!" Wu Mian shouted loudly, his voice echoing through the heavens.

"Kill!"

"Roar..." Hundreds of thousands of people and countless ghostly creatures roared, forming a black ocean that surged toward Bùtiān City.

The heavens thundered. The earth trembled violently. The overwhelming battle spirit reached the sky, and the cries of war spread in all directions, reaching Bùtiān City.

"What's happening?" Hearing the overwhelming cries of war, people in Bùtiān City were instantly thrown into chaos.

They had faced ghostly attacks before, but compared to this one, it was nothing. Never had they experienced such a situation.

"Everyone, follow me to the city wall!" Ke Duanshan's face changed instantly. He barked at the eighth legion who had already prepared, and his body flashed toward the wall.

At the same time, Zhang Heng followed them. Thirty thousand people rushed to meet the Hellish army.

"Damn it!" Zhang Heng's face changed instantly. He saw the Hellish army and his legs trembled, especially feeling the trembling aura behind it.

"Retreat!" Zhang Heng's face turned pale. His first thought was to turn around and flee toward Bùtiān City.

"Zhang Heng, a commander! Ha! Deserved to gain merit!"

"Comrades, we were humiliated yesterday. Today we must regain our honor on the battlefield!" As Zhang Heng turned around, a group of commanders from the Gate of Heaven rushed out immediately. At the same time, several half-Immortal Kings from the Wheel of Transmigration and Tian Gui Wang City rushed out. A total of six people surrounded Zhang Heng.

Moreover, several half-True Immortals flew over the ghostly soldiers toward here, as if they were afraid of missing out.

"Ah..." The two groups collided almost instantly. Zhang Heng's legion was immediately surrounded, and his soldiers' eyes showed despair.

"What's happening?" Jiang Chen appeared on the city wall. His gaze swept over the millions of Hellish troops, and his face turned pale.

Chapter 2519: Resistance

"What happened? Why did so many Hellish troops suddenly appear? Did the Gate of Heaven send all their forces? The Gate of Heaven doesn't have that many people!" Jiang Chen was confused. He knew the Gate of Heaven had more people than Bùtiān City, but not that many.

"Close the city gates and activate the defensive array!" Ke Duanshan shouted first, his reaction swift. Countless black-armored soldiers moved. The city gates closed immediately, and a powerful fluctuation rose along Bùtiān City's long walls, forming a barrier that blocked Bùtiān City.

"Zhang Heng is still outside!" Jiang Chen shouted, his gaze falling on Ke Duanshan.

"Lord Jiang, it's millions of people and Wu Mian. I also felt three Immortal Kings at the middle stage. The Hellish clearly intends to occupy our Bùtiān City!"

"Zhang Heng has already left the city and was surrounded. He can't escape. These thirty thousand people are definitely dead!" Ke Duanshan shouted, his eyes filled with anger. If they had investigated earlier, it wouldn't have been like this. They were prepared, but now Luotian's army had arrived without giving them a chance to react. It was too passive.

"Ah!" Jiang Chen finally reacted, nodding. After years of holding power, he was still quite sharp.

"Quickly contact Bùtiān Mountain. Also, have all the legions assemble and prepare for battle. You don't have much time; you must gather before Zhang Heng's group is completely consumed!" Jiang Chen shouted.

"Yes!" Several commanders shouted, quickly gathering their forces. They knew if they were late, it would cost them dearly.

"Lord Jiang, save me!" Zhang Heng cried desperately in the crowd, surrounded by several half-Immortal Kings. He was pitiful.

Thirty thousand against millions—on the scale of numbers, it was too much. Even if Zhang Heng's legion was valiant and fierce, it couldn't change the situation.

Thirty thousand people were quickly devoured by the Hellish army. Every moment, more people died. Twenty thousand... Ten thousand...

Within a quarter of an hour, thirty thousand people were buried on the battlefield. Countless flesh-eating ghosts emerged from the ground to enjoy their feast.

"Enough to fill my teeth!" Wu Mian stood at the back of the army, laughing lightly as he watched Zhang Heng's legion be annihilated.

"I surrender!" Zhang Heng shouted, surrounded by several half-Immortal Kings. He was no match for them, constantly fleeing but always encountering the Hellish army. Finally, he chose to surrender, knowing no one would come to save him. Even if all of Bùtiān City's people came out, they might also be annihilated.

"Refusing prisoners!" Wu Mian coldly ordered. Their main goal was to destroy the Nine Immortal Mountains and make Yama's Ten Palaces the rulers of the immortal world. The people of the Nine Immortal Mountains would not be spared.

"Boom..." Zhou Yuan punched Zhang Heng, who was severely wounded. His body was stained with blood as he roared into the sky.

"Army at the city gate!" Wu Mian gave another order. Millions of troops surged toward Bùtiān City again.

At this moment, all the commanders were on the city wall of Bùtiān City. They gazed at the countless ghosts and Hellish army, their faces pale.

"Defend it. Relying on Bùtiān City, we might be able to hold until the reinforcements from Bùtiān Mountain arrive. Do not let the Hellish break through our defenses!" Jiang Chen calmed down and began sending messages to Bùtiān Mountain.

After an hour of marching, the Hellish army arrived at the city gate and began to attack Bùtiān City. However, Bùtiān City's array was no ordinary one; it was extremely powerful. Ghostly creatures were annihilated under the attack of the array.

"Attack!" Jiang Chen shouted, and those who had gathered on the city wall unleashed various martial arts techniques together with the array to strike at the Hellish army.

"I see how long you can hold!" Wu Mian showed no surprise. The defending side had the advantage, but they were numerous and filled with ghosts. They could crush Bùtiān City by sheer numbers.

Boom after boom... Ghostly creatures attacked the array like suicide, and ghost cultivators also unleashed powerful martial arts to strike at Bùtiān City's formidable array.

At the same time, explosions rose along Bùtiān City's outer walls. Soldiers within Bùtiān City showed shock, though the array isolated them, they could still feel the powerful explosions. Outside the array, it was even more terrifying; ghostly creatures and cultivators were annihilated in the wild fluctuations.

Yet, ghosts and cultivators still attacked fearlessly. Wu Mian, Luotian, and Wang Gang stood at the back of the army.

Wu Mian showed no emotional fluctuations. He had experienced too much war. Luotian, however, looked with admiration. Wang Gang's face was pale; as one of the Eight Heavenly Kings, he had always been under the protection of the Beast Ghost King. This was his first time witnessing such a scene.

Every moment, people died; life here seemed extremely cheap. This made Wang Gang uncomfortable.

As the attacks continued, the quality of the three armies was revealed. The Gate of Heaven side was the main force and suffered the most casualties, but their death ratio was the smallest. They had long been seasoned in battle and knew how to survive in the most dangerous situations. Also, they did not want to disgrace Wu Mian again.

Bùtiān City's array was extremely powerful, but millions of ghosts attacking together could still shake it. The massive barrier constantly trembled.

Luotian, Wu Mian, Wang Gang, and Du Changming—four Immortal Kings had not yet attacked. Because the war had just begun, they wanted to save their best strength for the final moment and prevent any unexpected changes.

"What's going on? Have we contacted Bùtiān Mountain?" On the city wall of Bùtiān City, Jiang Chen's face showed anxiety. The entire Bùtiān City had only two Immortal Kings, one being himself and the other Ke Duanshan. Once the array was broken, they would have to face the Hellish army directly. At that time, they definitely couldn't resist. Only reinforcements could solve this crisis.

"We have contacted them. However, the reinforcements will take at least half a month to arrive. We can't hold for that long!" Ke Duanshan replied, his voice heavy with concern.

"Nearby sects can't provide support either. Because the Central Three Heavens are in civil war, Tianyuan Sect is waging wars against other sects. The immortal world now faces internal and external troubles," Ke Duanshan spoke, his voice heavy.

Time passed slowly. Under the attacks of the Hellish forces, the powerful barrier finally showed cracks.

"Comrades, give it one more push. We're about to succeed!" Wu Mian shouted, making the Hellish forces even more frenzied.

...

The news of the Gate of Heaven being attacked spread quickly to the Nine Immortal Mountains, causing them great shock.

"Thanks to that old bastard Yongsheng. If it weren't for Luotian's death, which stirred up Tianyuan Sect, they would have been devouring the sects of Central Three Heavens. Now there are sects that could go to support Hell!" Several peak Immortal Kings cursed, their voices filled with anger. They disappeared from their mountain peaks and flew toward Bùtiān Mountain.

"Since you have a good relationship with Tianyuan Sect, quickly contact them and end the civil war to support Hell!" Several peak Immortal Kings gathered rapidly and all converged on Bùtiān Mountain.

"Good relationship or not, when you killed their sect leader, why didn't you consider the bigger picture!" Bùtiān Immortal King's face was angry, his gaze falling on the old men.

"Since Hell has prepared for this attack, the Gate of Heaven is definitely lost. Now we need to discuss how to push Hell back!"

"For so many years, Hell has never attacked. Suddenly attacking must have over a fifty percent chance of success. Do you not know how strong Hell is?" Donghuang spoke, his voice heavy with concern.

"What do you think of the Ten Palaces of Yama's?" The others felt heavy, unsure why Hell had suddenly attacked.

They were most concerned about the final secret weapon of the Ten Palaces of Yama. That kind of weapon that could kill them. If they didn't lose half their strength, Hell wouldn't be considered a victory. After all, an Immortal King at the peak could control the weather.

"First, gather all sect disciples to support. Also, go to Tianyuan Sect and adjust it. If they don't cooperate, we'll have to destroy them. To repel external enemies, internal affairs must be settled first. A small Tianyuan Sect truly thinks it has the capital to resist the Nine Immortal Mountains!" Yongsheng said, his voice cold.

"Didn't you say it was because of you!" The peak Immortal Kings cursed in their hearts but didn't say it out loud. After all, now was not the time; they needed to unify the Nine Immortal Mountains' opinions.

"I agree. If Tianyuan Sect continues to be stubborn, we'll unite our forces and destroy it!" Besides Bùtiān Immortal King, the other sects all agreed.

"Destroy Tianyuan Sect. Do you know how much cost it would take?" Bùtiān Immortal King sneered, his gaze disdainful toward the peak Immortal Kings.

"Central Three Heavens has 100 sects. Tianyuan Sect has already destroyed six and subjugated ten! There are six at the middle stage of Immortal King, one at the late stage, and seven or eight at the early stage. Their disciples number two to three million! Do you think we can afford it if we don't act?"

"If they continue to develop, maybe the entire Central Three Heavens will be ruled by them!" Bùtiān Immortal King spoke, making the atmosphere in the hall instantly quiet. The peak Immortal Kings had never looked down on Tianyuan Sect, but in such a short time, it had developed to this extent.

"Let's just threaten them and have them guard Hell. We'll weaken their strength. If they don't obey, we'll destroy them!" The peak Immortal Kings made a decision and sent the sub-division of Yeshen to Central Three Heavens to deliver the message.

...

Boom... The deafening sound of a thousand battles echoed. The massive barrier turned into fragments of the Dao and shattered on the massive city walls, making the Hellish army's eyes light up with excitement.

Chapter 2520: Siege

A million, a total of one million ghostly creatures and cultivators died under the attacks of Bùtiān City's array and its disciples. This million's death caused Bùtiān City's barrier to collapse.

"Attack!" Wu Mian's cold voice echoed through the heavens. Millions of ghostly creatures and cultivators roared.

"Kill them all, and the immortal world should be under my control!"

"Kill! Taking Bùtiān City is just the first step. Don't disgrace us anymore!" The Gate of Heaven's commanders and sub-commanders roared, gazing at Luotian standing at the back of the crowd.

"We can't disgrace our Holy Prince and Heavenly King!" Luotian and Wang Gang's people also roared, as if competing. They rushed up the Bùtiān City walls.

Fires spread across the sky, and the massive Bùtiān City wall trembled. Ghostly creatures continuously attacked, soared into the air, and rushed toward Bùtiān City's towering walls. The overwhelming battle spirit spread across the heavens.

"Comrades, follow me! Our families are behind us. The Nine Immortal Mountains have sent reinforcements to arrive. We know we can succeed if we hold until the reinforcements come!" Jiang Chen shouted, leaping into the air. He knew he had to stand up now.

The domain expanded, eight thousand zhangs, the aura of an Immortal King at the middle stage burst out. His gaze was deep as he looked at Wu Mian standing at the back of the Hellish army.

"Wu Mian, come and fight!" Jiang Chen's eyes flickered slightly. He hadn't found an Immortal King at the middle stage, so his hope was ignited.

A golden sword appeared in Ke Duanshan's hand. His eyes showed battle intent, standing behind Jiang Chen with the same battle spirit.

"Battle! What's there to fear!" Wu Mian laughed. Even though Jiang Chen was at the middle stage of an Immortal King, he still had no fear because he was Wu Mian!

Two streaks of light rose. One came from Bùtiān City, and the other was Wu Mian. They passed through the crowd and appeared in the sky.

Jiang Chen held a golden sword, while Wu Mian grasped a black spear. They collided instantly in the sky.

Crack... Thunder roared, announcing the start of an Immortal King battle. Wu Mian was immediately pushed back by Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen's eyes showed contempt. Though he had spent these years in luxury, his cultivation hadn't declined. He knew that strength was the fundamental.

"An Immortal King at the early stage dares to attack Bùtiān City!" Jiang Chen's eyes showed arrogance. If he could eliminate Wu Mian, it would be a great boost for Bùtiān City's morale.

"I didn't expect you to have reached the middle stage of an Immortal King. But it doesn't change the result!"

"Your Holy Prince, Heavenly King!" Wu Mian shouted. Luotian and Wang Gang immediately stood behind Wu Mian, looking at Jiang Chen.

"Luotian!" Seeing Luotian standing behind Wu Mian, Jiang Chen's face showed disbelief. He almost couldn't believe it.

"Luotian!" Ke Duanshan's face also showed shock. They hadn't expected Luotian to appear on the battlefield.

Who in the immortal world didn't know that Luotian had caused a big trouble at Yongsheng Mountain, causing heavy losses. Finally, he used forbidden techniques and was annihilated. It was precisely Luotian's death that made Tianyuan Sect go mad and destroy Yongsheng Mountain's forces in Central Three Heavens.

Ke Duanshan had been sad when he heard of Luotian's death, as Luotian had once been his soldier. A dead person suddenly appearing could not help but shock people. The soldiers of Bùtiān City were also shocked, as they had all heard of Luotian's name.

"You're still alive!" Jiang Chen exclaimed, and his body retreated. The identity of a ghost valley disciple had caused heavy losses to Yongsheng Mountain, so Jiang Chen couldn't help but take it seriously.

"You are a senior of Yongsheng Mountain, yet you betrayed Yongsheng Mountain and fought against the immortal world!" Jiang Chen shouted, his eyes filled with anger.

"What Yongsheng Mountain senior? I am the Holy Prince of the Wheel of Transmigration, Luotian!" Luotian coldly spoke, looking at Jiang Chen with a sense of discomfort.

"Kill!" At the same time, Luotian, Wu Mian, and Wang Gang's bodies moved, rushing toward Jiang Chen.

"Luotian, you still have a chance to turn back!" Ke Duanshan shouted, regaining his senses.

But Ke Duanshan's words did not catch Luotian's attention. Luotian and the others had already started to fight Jiang Chen.

"Ke Duanshan, your opponent is me. For so many years, it's time to settle the score!" Du Changming smiled slightly. They had been old rivals; both had remained in the Gate of Heaven and Bùtiān City.

"Du Changming!" Ke Duanshan's face darkened. His golden divine sword burst out with a powerful fluctuation, clashing against Du Changming.

Luotian held a blood-red sword and stepped with the Yellow River Steps, rushing forward. He appeared in front of Jiang Chen instantly, slashing downward with his blood-red sword.

"Crack..." Jiang Chen's face was grim. He raised his sword to meet Luotian, and both of them retreated.

Not yet steady, a black spear was already rushing toward Jiang Chen's back, making him shudder.

"So strong!" Jiang Chen turned around and blocked the black spear with his golden sword. His heart was shocked by Luotian's strength.

...

Because of the passive defense, Jiang Chen took a few steps back. Not yet steady, Wang Gang's attack also arrived like a tiger descending from the mountain. Wang Gang's hands were wrapped in gloves, directly smashing Jiang Chen's shoulder.

"Crack..." This time, Jiang Chen had no time to block. He was hit by Wang Gang's fist on his shoulder, and the sound of cracking flesh echoed. The tiger's fangs directly bit into Jiang Chen's shoulder, tearing off a large piece of flesh. However, Jiang Chen was an Immortal King at the middle stage, stronger than an early-stage one. His body was extremely strong. Wang Gang's punch could hurt him, but it wasn't fatal.

Three Immortal Kings at the early stage. Normally, if Jiang Chen unleashed his power and fought a battle, he was confident he could kill them. But now he was in a passive position.

"Damn it!" Before Jiang Chen could react, Luotian's blood sword again vanished into the void and slashed down. Jiang Chen had no choice but to respond.

"Crack..." Jiang Chen raised his sword to meet the blood-red blade. His body fell from the sky, almost crushing many Bùtiān City disciples. He stopped at the last moment.

"Domain!" A domain spread out, a powerful pressure from Jiang Chen's body surged toward Luotian and the others.

"Condemnation of Heaven!"

"Beast Domain!"

"Reincarnation Domain!" Seeing Jiang Chen's domain, Luotian and the others immediately opened their domains to counter Jiang Chen's.

In the sky, four people stood still for a moment. But the sound of collision rose at the boundary of their domains.

Crack after crack, Wu Mian and Wang Gang's faces slightly changed. The difference between an early-stage Immortal King domain and a middle-stage one was significant, so they quickly realized their domains were beginning to break. They could only continuously shrink the range of their domains.

"Broken Mountain Sword!" Jiang Chen stood still and shouted. He gripped his sword with both hands, lifting it toward Wu Mian's direction and slashing.

After a while of fighting, Jiang Chen had realized that Luotian was the strongest among the three. Wu Mian was next, and Wang Gang was last. But Jiang Chen still chose Wu Mian because he was the backbone of the Gate of Heaven army. If Wu Mian were killed, it would definitely be a big blow to Hell.

With full power, he slashed. The aura was terrifying, and a half-moon flew out, slashing toward Wu Mian. This made Wu Mian's body pause slightly.

At this moment, his domain had been compressed to a hundred zhangs. Jiang Chen's domain power suppressed him, limiting his movement. No matter how he tried to escape, he couldn't avoid this slash.

"Thousand Faces!" Facing Jiang Chen's full power attack, Wu Mian would not sit idly by. His face without a face began to change rapidly, and a series of faces flew out from his face, imprinted on the black spear. The dark light surged.

"Open!" Wu Mian shouted and raised his black spear over his head, meeting the sword's aura that radiated overwhelming power.

The heavens roared. A wild fluctuation spread over Wu Mian's head, and his body fell to the ground, blood spilling from his face without a face.

"General!" The ghostly cultivators of Hell shouted, watching Wu Mian's arms covered with cracks.

"Continue!" Wu Mian shouted. His body flew back into the sky.

"You have no chance left!" Jiang Chen stood in the sky, his sword glowing with a brilliant light again. He quickly gathered power.

"You have no chance either!" But before Jiang Chen could deliver the second strike, a cold voice appeared behind him. This made Jiang Chen pause slightly. A strong sense of danger surged from his heart. Without thinking, he turned and slashed behind him.

But Jiang Chen's speed was still too slow. Six shadowy fists appeared in Jiang Chen's vision, making his eyes blur.

The six fist images merged into Jiang Chen's chest. A surge of blood gas, and Jiang Chen's heart suddenly stopped for a moment. His body flew backward, spitting out blood violently.

"How is this possible!" Jiang Chen's heart was shocked. He hadn't expected Luotian to be unaffected by his domain.

"Boom..." Jiang Chen's body collided with Bùtiān City's wall, sending up a large amount of debris. His body was embedded in the city wall.

With Jiang Chen injured, that domain power also disappeared, making Wu Mian and Wang Gang feel much better. They both formed hand signs, their ghostly energy surged, and two powerful martial arts techniques rushed toward Jiang Chen.

Boom boom... The high walls collapsed in large pieces. Smoke spread, obscuring people's vision.

"Lord Jiang!" The disciples of Bùtiān City shouted. Wu Mian was the leader of Hell, but Jiang Chen was no less.

"Luotian! You've been so good to Bùtiān Immortal King, repeatedly protecting you and even risking a fight with the Nine Immortal Mountains!" The soldiers of Bùtiān City roared.

"Huh?" Hearing the soldiers' roar, Luotian paused slightly.

"Buzz..." At that moment, a golden light shot through the smoke and slashed toward Luotian. It carried heavenly power and rushed toward him.

Chapter 2521: Retreat

The golden sword light illuminated the sky. It quickly reached Luotian's vicinity, making his eyes show caution. This sword light could kill him if not handled properly.

In an instant, Luotian grabbed with one hand and held his blood-red sword with the other. He slashed immediately.

The collision sound echoed, and the devastating golden sword light directly collided with Luotian's blood-red sword. The sword in Luotian's hand was immediately shattered.

Using the Eight Directions of Treasure, Luotian desperately controlled the still powerful sword light and weakened its power.

"Blood spurted from Luotian's body. A sword mark appeared on his chest, making him retreat.

"Close call!" Luotian looked at the sword mark on his chest. The wound was slowly healing. His gaze fell on the figure emerging from the smoke, which was Jiang Chen.

At this moment, Jiang Chen was covered in blood. His left hand held a sword, and his right hand carried a golden sword—Bùtiān Sword.

Though it was called Bùtiān Sword, it was actually a replica. However, its power was still formidable. From Luotian's difficult defense earlier, one could see that.

"This doesn't kill you!" Jiang Chen's eyes also showed surprise as he looked at Luotian standing in the sky.

"Kill!" Wu Mian and Wang Gang, seeing Luotian injured, flew forward toward Jiang Chen.

Jiang Chen moved his hands. One sword in each hand, he began to fight against Wang Gang and Wu Mian.

Luotian stood still. He watched his chest wound slowly heal, his eyes showing a cold light.

"No matter what happened before, if you want to kill me now, I won't let you go!" Luotian muttered quietly. He leaped into the air, and his blood sword appeared in his hand, rushing toward Jiang Chen.

Ke Duanshan continuously fought against Du Changming. Neither could defeat the other, both wanting to eliminate each other to help their side gain an advantage. If it were an Immortal King battle, the result would be uncertain.

"Jiang Chen's sword and blade state have been forced out!" Ke Duanshan watched the battlefield of Luotian's four people, watching Jiang Chen fighting against the three with bloodshed. His heart was shocked.

"I didn't expect Jiang Chen to have reached the middle stage of an Immortal King!" Du Changming was also very surprised. Their intelligence had said Jiang Chen was at the early stage of an Immortal King, but this change was unexpected.

Fires spread across the sky. On another side, millions of Gate of Heaven troops had gained some advantages. At first, many people died under Bùtiān City's walls.

But as time passed, the Hellish ghostly cultivators and creatures gradually climbed onto the city walls. Bùtiān City's casualties began to increase, as both sides were vastly different in strength. The number of half-Immortal Kings and True Immortals was not comparable.

Time passed slowly. An hour had gone by, and the city walls of Bùtiān City were beginning to be stained with blood. Blood flowed into Bùtiān City.

"Comrades, hold on!" Commanders shouted, watching soldiers around them fall. They were helpless as they were also struggling hard.

"Lord Jiang, the comrades are about to give up!" Ke Duanshan shouted. He watched Bùtiān City's side losing people constantly, fighting with their lives. It was just a matter of time before they were broken through. In this one hour, they had already lost tens of thousands.

"I know!" Jiang Chen shouted. He knew this situation was best to retreat, but he couldn't let go of Bùtiān City. It was his life's work, and he had spent most of his life there. He had carefully developed it.

"Preserve the green mountains, don't fear no firewood!" Jiang Chen's heart was bleeding. He watched Bùtiān City's soldiers dying constantly—these were his assets. The city could be taken back, but if people died, it would be truly lost.

"Bùtiān Sword Array!" Jiang Chen roared. He decided to make a final move. His golden sword danced, emitting ten thousand zhangs of light. His arm was shattered, blood flowed out, and it formed blood seals on his arms. The divine sword continued to dance.

A series of sword lights suddenly erupted, forming a net of sword energy that enveloped Luotian and Wu Mian.

"Using one person's power to activate the Bùtiān Sword Array!" Wu Mian exclaimed, not expecting Jiang Chen to be so strong.

The Bùtiān Sword Array was something Wu Mian had heard of, but he had never heard of it being activated by one person.

"Buzz..."
