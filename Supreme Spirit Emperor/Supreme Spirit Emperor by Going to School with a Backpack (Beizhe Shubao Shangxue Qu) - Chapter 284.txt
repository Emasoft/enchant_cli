Long Ao, leader of the Dragon Clan and a cultivator at the Late Stage Sage level, was also currently the Dragon Clan's Sage Prince. Long Ba's father, if Long Jie returned, he would have a formidable opponent. Although Long Ba was the Dragon Clan's Sage Prince, his strength paled in comparison to Long Jie and Cao Dedu. This inevitably affected their faction's standing within the Dragon Clan.

"Boom..." Before Long Ao could continue speaking, a golden dragon surged forth and condensed into a massive golden hand that slammed onto Long Ao's body.

"Crack..." Long Ao spat blood, his eyes wide with terror. The overwhelming pressure of the dragon lineage had made him feel an immense threat.

"Why did you refuse?" Long Jie's youthful face bore a frosty expression. Though seemingly young, he radiated an imposing aura.

"I..." Long Ao's face turned crimson as he prepared to speak again. But before he could, Long Jie materialized beside him, looking down with an air of superiority. Imperial dragon qi surrounded Long Jie's body, forcing Long Ao to swallow his words.

"Long Jie, don't overstep! Release my father!" A commanding voice echoed as Long Ba, a towering figure clad in blue robes, stepped forward from the crowd.

"This is Long Ba. You should know him," Cao Dedu said to Luotian, introducing the high-ranking figures within the Dragon Clan.

"Still remember?" Luotian shook his head lightly. He had encountered so many Sage Princes that he had killed countless of them; this Dragon Clan's Sage Prince was nothing to him.

Luotian made no move to attack. First, he trusted Long Jie; second, he knew that for Long Jie to firmly establish himself, a震慑 (intimidation) was necessary. Though they were sworn brothers, Luotian was an outsider. If he aided Long Jie, it would give others grounds to criticize him.

As they pondered, Long Ba appeared before Long Jie. His blue fist roared with dragon cries and charged toward Long Jie.

"Only you could dare attack me under the pressure of my bloodline," Long Jie's face flickered with surprise. His innate imperial authority radiated, golden imperial dragon qi swirling around his arm. Without hesitation, he struck back with a punch.

"Crack..." The collision of golden and blue fists sent shockwaves outward, the sound of bones breaking echoing as Long Ba's massive body was hurled backward, his arm shattered.

"Roar!" Long Jie howled, transforming into a golden light that soared skyward like a meteor, crashing down upon the fallen Long Ba.

"Boom!" A powerful pressure descended. As soon as Long Ba landed, Long Jie descended like a god, his foot crushing down with nine strands of imperial dragon qi. The force reduced Long Ba's massive body to a mist of blood scattered across the ground.

Yet, Long Jie did not stop. Nine true dragons unleashed their power, completely incinerating the blood mist, erasing it from sight.

The entire process was too fast. Long Jie now at the Late Stage Sage level, nearly reaching the peak of Sagehood. Even against the Dragon Clan's ancestral ancestor, Long Jie's bloodline advantage made him fearless. How much more so against Long Ba, who was naturally inferior.

The Dragon Clan's people erupted in fury. They had not expected Long Jie to be so ruthless, killing the current Dragon Clan's Sage Prince before their very eyes.

Even the Dragon Ancestor's gaze flickered, then returned to calmness. He knew Long Jie was intimidating them, specifically the faction of Long Ao.

"I killed you!" Seeing his son slain in an instant, Long Ao's eyes turned red. He lunged at Long Jie as if fueled by aphrodisiacs.

"Oh, the dream is beautiful but reality is harsh. Since you wish to die, I'll send you to join your son!" Long Jie's voice held no emotion. Nine true dragons shot forth, directly attacking Long Ao.

Though Long Ao was the Dragon Clan's leader and a Late Stage Sage cultivator, his actual combat strength fell short of his son. Trapped by nine true dragons, he was annihilated within moments.

"Iron-blooded!" At that moment, people gazed at Long Jie's youthful face and could only think of this phrase. It felt like witnessing the return of Long Zhan Tian.

"Does anyone have objections?" The Dragon Ancestor, seeing it was enough, addressed the Dragon Clan's people with a satisfied expression. To him, Long Jie surpassed Long Ba by countless times. He secretly sighed, regretting his indecisiveness and overcaution, wishing he had brought Long Jie back sooner.

Though Long Jie now seemed to return, his sense of belonging within the Dragon Clan was not as strong as it was with Luotian. There was no helping it; they had never truly considered Long Jie one of their own and constantly troubled him.

"Hope he can gradually see the Dragon Clan as his true home," the Dragon Ancestor sighed inwardly, scanning Long Ao's faction.

"Who dares object? Clearly, those who object will die!" The Dragon Clan people trembled. No one dared to challenge.

"Alright, let's host a feast to welcome the Dragon Lord back. Invite his friends as well. From now on, all Dragon Clan matters will be handled by the Dragon Lord!" The Dragon Ancestor's gaze held a hint of joy as he disappeared from view, needing to deal with Long Ao and Long Ba's deaths.

"Revere the Dragon Lord!" The Dragon Clan people bowed to Long Jie, knowing now there was no one who could stop his ascension as the Dragon Clan's leader.

That night, they prepared a lavish feast for Long Jie and Luotian. The awkwardness among the guests eased, as Long Jie's strength had proven his capability.

The feast lasted until late at night. Luotian returned to the luxurious accommodation prepared by the Dragon Clan. Upon arrival, he mentally communicated with Cao Dedu and Yan Jun, instructing them to wait for him outside the Holy City.

Luotian then vanished into the night, merging with the void. He needed to eliminate Fengzu and Pengzu to pave a path for Long Jie and Cao Dedu's future control over the Beast Domain. As for revenge, Luotian did not care; their feud with the Phoenix Clan was already irreconcilable.

His figure darted through the gray space, arriving at Fengzu's residence in an instant. He hid within the void, a smile on his face.

"Good thing I don't have to move twice!" Luotian's eyes gleamed coldly. His spiritual sense detected two aged figures sitting there, as if discussing something.

"Fengzu, we can't just hand over the Holy City to them!" Pengzu's face bore a cold glint, sitting at Fengzu's side with deep thoughts.

"Of course not. Tomorrow, Old Long will surely come to negotiate. I'll feign illness and refuse to meet him, delaying the handover. You take this time to gather our loyal clans. Once Luotian leaves, we'll strike back and destroy the Dragon Clan! This years of planning was a bit early, but there's no other choice now!" Fengzu's eyes flashed with malice.

"Is it too early to start?" Pengzu's face changed upon hearing Fengzu's words.

"No choice. Though not fully mature, it was disrupted by Luotian. With Cao Yuanshan absent from the Beast Domain, this is the best time to strike!" Fengzu sighed deeply.

"Regardless of your plans, you'll have no chance to execute them!" As they spoke, Luotian's cold voice suddenly echoed through the hall.

"Who is it!" Their faces showed shock, immediately rising and shouting. Their power surged rapidly.

But before they could fully stand, two golden lights flashed and appeared before them. They felt a chill in their hearts, then lost consciousness, their bodies collapsing into two blood mists scattered across the hall.

Luotian wielded the Shangtian Bow, piercing through space to appear in the hall. His face was cold as he watched their blood coalesce, then extended a hand to unleash the Dao's power, completely incinerating their flesh and bone.

After finishing this, Luotian did not hesitate. He re-entered the void, appearing at the agreed location with Yan Jun and Cao Dedu outside the Holy City.

"How was it?" As soon as Luotian appeared, Cao Dedu and Yan Jun approached, their eyes filled with inquiry.

"No problem. I need to go to the Thunder Domain. Will you stay in the Holy City or come with me?" Luotian smiled, looking at them. With Fengzu and Pengzu dead, the Beast Domain would surely be in chaos. This was Long Jie's time to rise; no one could threaten him now.

Chapter 1190: Seeking the Hidden Cards

Under the starry sky of the Thunder Domain, Luotian stood calmly. His presence held no aura, yet he shone like a brilliant star. Li Tianyu's face was pale.

Li Tianyu had not expected Luotian to be so powerful. Even the aura alone was enough to overwhelm him, leaving Li Tianyu in awe.

The surrounding people felt nothing. Their eyes showed confusion as they watched Li Tianyu's pale face, unsure why he was motionless.

Time passed slowly. After about ten breaths, Li Tianyu stood like a statue, unable to move an inch. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead.

"Since you won't come, I'll go myself!" Luotian's face still held a smile, but it made Li Tianyu feel as if he were descending into the abyss. His entire body felt endless coldness.

"Buzz..." Luotian took a step, invisible spiritual patterns spreading beneath his feet. The Dao's power filled the air, instantly enveloping Li Tianyu.

"Crack..." After Luotian took one step, a series of cracking sounds echoed from Li Tianyu's body. His dantian roared, and the sage energy within it surged violently.

Luotian took another step. Now only tens of zhang away from Li Tianyu, the Dao's voice thundered. Li Tianyu could no longer endure, his body covered in cracks as if being crushed by an invisible force.

"Snort..." People finally noticed Li Tianyu's abnormality. They inhaled sharply, their eyes filled with reverence. This was Luotian—those at the Late Stage Sage level were like paper before him, unable to resist.

"Roar!" Li Tianyu howled, desperately trying to break free from the Dao's constraints. His body radiated waves of lightning, scattering outward. He continuously punched, trying to ease his physical pain and withstand the Dao's power.

"Boom!" At that moment, Luotian took his third step. Only several zhang away from Li Tianyu.

"Boom!" As Luotian's third step landed, Li Tianyu could no longer endure. His body exploded into a mist of blood floating under the starry sky.

"This..." People were completely panicked. Though Li Tianyu's strength was not on par with the Sage Prince level, it was still considerable. They had never expected Luotian to be so powerful—just his aura alone, without moving a hand, had shattered Li Tianyu's body.

Blood and flesh slowly coalesced with Li Tianyu's drifting soul, forming his pale face. He appeared before the people.

Li Tianyu was terrified beyond measure. He had truly felt death's proximity. If Luotian wanted his life, as long as the Dao's power did not recede, he would be dead for sure.

"How is it? Do I have any problems?" Luotian looked down at the reformed Li Tianyu, his gaze still calm.

"No... no problems!" Li Tianyu dared not meet Luotian's eyes, his voice trembling. He had yet to recover from the terror of almost dying.

"Oh, then we'll go first!" Luotian waved to the stunned Cao Dedu, Ren Hongzhe, and Yan Jun. He walked toward the joint encampment of the domains.

"Old boss, you're really fierce!" Ren Hongzhe couldn't help but admire, his eyes filled with fervor. His subordinates were equally fervent.

"Unseen arrogance is the most deadly. I didn't expect you to inherit my style, learning to be arrogant!" Cao Dedu looked at Luotian with satisfaction in his purple eyes.

"Shut up..." Luotian kicked Cao Dedu away. As they chatted, they reached the joint encampment.

With the invasion of the Mortal Domain, the Thunder Domain was now in chaos. Figures darted about, each domain's army stationed on separate continents.

What caught Luotian's attention was the continuous roaring sounds, as if overturning the entire starry sky. The wild waves constantly battered their bodies.

"The battle continues, but it's much smaller than before. After so many days of fighting, both sides are exhausted, as if they've reached an agreement. The Mortal Domain's attacks have also lessened, occasionally sending small groups to harass!" Ren Hongzhe sighed deeply, his voice carrying exhaustion. If it weren't for him guarding the portal array, he might have joined the battle.

"Let's go. First take me to the location of the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Luotian's powerful spiritual sense scanned, his gaze directed at the encampment of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Okay," Ren Hongzhe nodded and led Luotian into the continent. The Four Sacred Star Domains' encampment was bustling with people. Though the continent was vast, all remaining commoners and low-level cultivators had gathered in several places, making the entire continent crowded.

At the peak of a towering mountain within the central area was the Four Sacred Star Domains' base. Soon, they arrived at the mountain's summit.

As Luotian arrived, the Four Sacred Star Domains' top combat forces also gathered. They sighed in relief. Though they held some authority, compared to Luotian, they were still lacking.

"Luotian!" After exchanging greetings, they led Luotian to the temporary council hall.

Looking at familiar faces, Nangong Yuying was also among them. With Nangong Bo and the Demon Lord stationed in the Demon Clan, there was no need for him to be a Sage Prince. Now, under the Demon Lord's careful cultivation, Nangong Yuying had reached the Late Stage Sage level. His demeanor was more composed.

"How is it?" As soon as Luotian arrived, he asked about the current situation. Ren Hongzhe, stationed at the portal array, was unfamiliar with certain details.

"It's not optimistic. Our forces from the Four Sacred Star Domains have already lost nearly a million people in just a few days. Other domains' forces are scattered, fighting independently. The number of Late Stage Sage-level warriors is severely lacking. One Late Stage Sage's power is terrifying; two or three could match hundreds of thousands. The enemy has over ten Late Stage Sages, while we only have six or seven. We're relying on numbers to fight!" Luolong shook his head, a worried expression in his eyes. The war had just begun, yet their forces were already heavily damaged.

"The Mortal Domain announced they'll launch a major battle in seven days. Every day, people are dying. By the time of the big battle, it'll be ten times worse!" Luolong and others showed deep concern. The Four Sacred Star Domains and the Fire Domain had shallow resources. If an era-level powerhouse appeared, they would be doomed.

"There's no choice. If it gets worse, we'll have to bring the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain's people into the Ancient Heaven Palace!" Luotian sighed deeply, preparing for the worst. The Ancient Heaven Palace was an era treasure and should be able to protect everyone's safety.

"Wait. For now, with your arrival, we might be able to fight the Mortal Domain. But for future battles, there's no way but to rely on the great domains' holy clans. We have no idea!" Luolong knew Luotian's combat power, though he was a Late Stage Sage, could withstand several Late Stage Sages. This temporarily compensated for the lack of high-level combat strength.

"Seven days!" Luotian's brows furrowed slightly. A thought was brewing in his mind. He couldn't rely on the holy clans' support, for if it were a world-ending war, those people might not even have time to save themselves, let alone help the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain.

Luotian's arrival in the Thunder Domain was spread throughout the allied forces. However, it didn't raise any confidence. After all, one person's power could never change the war's outcome unless an era-level powerhouse appeared. Otherwise, there was no chance to alter the result.

Luotian stayed in the Thunder Domain for only a day before disappearing from view. No one knew where he went, but the Four Sacred Star Domains' people knew he had his reasons.

Though the Four Sacred Star Domains thought this way, other domains' people didn't. Rumors spread quickly. The entire Thunder Domain was filled with the rumor that Luotian had retreated and fled from the Thunder Domain. This rumor, seemingly pushed by some people, spread within a day across all allied forces.

"Deserter! You claimed to be invincible among your peers. How could you run away so quickly? It's truly embarrassing. You Four Sacred Star Domains should leave too; we don't need you. We can still defeat the Mortal Domain!" The entire allied force shouted this.

In response, the Four Sacred Star Domains people chose to endure without responding. They remained in their encampment, waiting for Luotian's return.

"Hope it's not too late!" At this moment, Luotian walked through the bloodstained starry sky, muttering to himself. He arrived at a towering cliff.

"Severed Spirit Cliff!" Luotian gazed at the towering cliff, his eyes filled with reverence. After leaving the Thunder Domain, he had arrived at the Four Sacred Star Domains because of a bold plan. If it succeeded, he would definitely secure the greatest protection for the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain.

Luotian naturally knew Severed Spirit Cliff well. He quickly reached the altar he had been at before, his eyes filled with respect as he looked at the Devouring Soul Beast beside Zhongli Tian.

"Respectful greetings, Elder Devouring Soul Beast!" Luotian's voice rang out as he bowed to the Devouring Soul Beast.

The beast's murky eyes slowly opened. Its voice echoed in Luotian's mind: "What are you here for again? You're still at the Late Stage Sage level. You're not qualified to help me!"

"I wish to borrow Elder Zhongli Tian's body for a moment!" Luotian directly stated his intention, coming for Zhongli Tian's body.

"Get out..." Hearing Luotian's request, the Devouring Soul Beast turned cold. Its voice carried a hint of killing intent.

"Don't think because I can stand here, you'll look at me differently. Get out! You won't come back again!" The Devouring Soul Beast spoke, clearly Luotian's request had touched its底线 (bottom line).

"Respectful greetings, Elder. I beg you to help the Nine Domains overcome this crisis in memory of Elder Zhongli Tian and Miss Miaoyin's contributions to humanity!" Luotian bowed respectfully, his gaze filled with reverence.

"Don't mention contributing to humanity. My two masters have contributed enough. If it weren't for my master resisting the蛮族战神 (Barbarian Clan's War God), and Miss Miaoyin shaking the ancient times, humanity might not exist. Now my master is left with only a body. You still want him to fight for humanity? I won't agree. Leave now, or I'll personally send you away!" The Devouring Soul Beast's eyes were cold. It directly rejected Luotian's words.

"I believe my two masters would agree to my request if they were here!" Luotian was unwilling to give up, speaking again.

"Get out..." A roar shook the heavens. The Devouring Soul Beast finally grew impatient, roaring and sending out gray mist that turned into a storm, swirling around Luotian on the vast altar.

The Devouring Soul Beast was immensely powerful. Though Luotian didn't know its strength, it had been nurtured by Miss Miaoyin and an era-level reincarnation. After years of being sealed on the altar, accompanying Zhongli Tian's body, it wouldn't be inferior. Even if Luotian was at the Late Stage Sage level, he would not be a match for the Devouring Soul Beast.

The wild mist instantly pushed Luotian out of Severed Spirit Cliff, but it didn't harm him.

"Because you've cultivated so long, I won't hold this against you. Wanting to move my master's body is a dream!" The Devouring Soul Beast's cold voice echoed in Luotian's mind, making his eyes show a bitter smile.

"Can't!" Luotian gritted his teeth and flew back into Severed Spirit Cliff, walking toward the summit of the cliff.

"Don't take it for granted. If you persist, I won't be kind!" Seeing Luotian approaching the summit again, the Devouring Soul Beast finally became angry. It spat out gray mist that turned into a storm, sweeping over Luotian and pushing him beyond the domain. This time, however, Luotian's body bore wounds, blood dripping from them.

"Respectful greetings, Elder. I beg you to lend me Elder Zhongli Tian's body for a moment!" Luotian, however, seemed unaffected by his injuries. He stood determinedly on the summit of Severed Spirit Cliff.

"Don't provoke me. Since you're a reincarnation, and the same as Master Zhongli Tian, I've helped you before. Now you're coming here to bother me?" The Devouring Soul Beast's voice showed impatience, pushing Luotian out of Severed Spirit Cliff again.

"Please give me a chance!" Luotian stood at the base of Severed Spirit Cliff, his voice filled with respect.

"Ha! A chance. Good, I'll give you a chance. If you can reach the summit, I'll let you take your master's body!" The Devouring Soul Beast seemed to be touched by Luotian's determination. It transmitted this to him.

"Good!" Luotian nodded and accepted. Since the other had given him a chance, it was better than nothing.

"Roar..." A low roar echoed from the Devouring Soul Beast's mouth. The gray Devouring Mist surged again, instantly enveloping the entire Severed Spirit Cliff. Even with Luotian's Purple Extreme Demon Eye, he couldn't see beyond ten zhang.

Moreover, the immense pressure made Luotian shocked. The gray mist wrapped around his body like knives cutting him.

"Though it's difficult, there's still a chance!" Luotian showed a bitter smile. He took a step toward the summit of Severed Spirit Cliff.

"You really resemble Master Zhongli Tian when he was young!" The Devouring Soul Beast lay on the altar, looking at Luotian and then at Zhongli Tian's body. Its murky gray eyes showed a series of sighs.

"Crack..." Luotian's face was drenched in sweat. His body emitted a series of cracking sounds. He gritted his teeth, his entire body feeling like it was being flayed by a thousand knives.

After walking for half an hour, the extreme pain made Luotian almost numb. The gray mist entered his body, like its name suggested, continuously eroding and destroying his flesh while also invading his soul. But Luotian had no way to deal with it, as the mist clung to his soul like a parasite without form.

"Damn!" Luotian was shocked by the Devouring Soul Beast's method. It was a dead end with no chance of success. Now, he had no hope of reaching the summit. If he continued like this, it would only be a path to death.

"This Devouring Soul Beast is no better than the Yin Fish's spirit. At least Yin Fish gave me a chance. Most people wouldn't have any possibility of success!" Luotian felt desperate, unable to find a way to break through the gray mist.

Thinking this, Luotian stopped moving and sat in meditation within the gray mist, pondering how to break through it.

"Can't endure anymore?" The Devouring Soul Beast sensed Luotian's stop and showed a smile. Luotian was right; this was an absolute trap. Most Late Stage Sage-level cultivators couldn't even enter the Devouring Mist, let alone walk through it. If not for Luotian's body surpassing most Late Stage Sages, he might not have lasted half an hour.

"The denser the mist toward the summit, the more difficult it is. This short distance has already made me unable to endure. If I go higher, I definitely won't succeed!" Luotian's thoughts turned.

"To successfully reach the summit, the only way is to advance!" Luotian's gaze deepened. He could think of no other method but to enhance his body and soul.

"Advancement! To reach the early era level in one go is still unlikely. However, to reach half-step era should be possible!" Luotian muttered inwardly. His body emitted a series of thunderous sounds.

At the same time, Luotian took out three sacred herbs and placed them in his mouth. He activated the Five Elements Transformation Technique, beginning to refine the immense medicinal power within.

Although Luotian now had the "Feiyu Scripture" created by an era-level master, he felt that the Five Elements Transformation Technique from the Era Book suited him better.

Silence enveloped the Severed Spirit Cliff as Luotian's breakthrough also fell into silence. Only the thunderous sounds from his dantian echoed.

"Buzz..." Time passed slowly. Luotian's breakthrough plunged him into a state of oblivion, no longer moving toward the summit. His body and soul had recovered to their peak state after three days of restoration.

"Not enough!" Three days later, Luotian slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was deep and intense. At the same time, he felt a sense of urgency. He knew that he might not make it to the battle against the Mortal Domain, but he had no choice. He knew that at this moment, the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain might be able to withstand for a while. However, if other nine great powers emerged, more terrifying than Mortal Domain's leader, the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain would have no chance of victory.

"Stay strong!" Luotian's heart cried out. He closed his eyes and began to push again, his aura gradually rising.

Time passed slowly. Though Luotian was anxious, he knew that advancement couldn't be rushed; it required opportunity and accumulation. He had been at the Late Stage Sage level for a short time but was close to perfection. If he could cultivate even a bit of era power, he would become a half-step era-level powerhouse.

Four days passed. As Luotian was pushing for the half-step era, under the starry sky of the Thunder Domain, a gray figure slowly gathered. A blue copper pot floated in the starry sky, blood energy swirling around it. Countless blood energies spilled from the blue copper pot, filling the entire Thunder Domain's starry sky.

"The great battle begins!" Mortal Domain's leader, Ming Yongzhi, wore a bloodthirsty expression. Previously losing many people in the Four Sacred Star Domains had made him feel his attack on the Nine Domains slowed. This long period of only slaughtering one domain had made Ming Yongzhi very dissatisfied. This time, he had resolved to capture the Thunder Domain in one strike.

"Kill!" The Mortal Domain's people roared, forming a gray tide that rushed toward the few remaining continents of the Thunder Domain.

"Have they come?" The allied forces of several domains, still with over two million people, stood there like an ocean, stretching endlessly.

In front of the crowd, the Demon Lord and Star Realm's domain master Zhou Tianxing stood at the forefront. Above them floated a black demon sword and a blue chessboard—two domain's era treasures, radiating overwhelming power.

"Kill! Hope we can withstand it!" The Demon Lord's face bore a cold glint. He held the black era treasure demon sword, his voice filled with killing intent.

"It should be fine. What worries me most is the subsequent chaos. I think it will awaken our Star Realm's resources!" Zhou Tianxing spoke softly, his eyes flashing with wisdom.

Chapter 1192: Half-Step Era

Far from the Thunder Sea Marshes of the Eight-Domain Alliance, the allied forces clashed with the Mortal Domain. Roars echoed through the sky. One side fought to protect their homeland from invasion, while the other sought to massacre all nine domains and complete their long-planned scheme.

Numerous awe-inspiring martial arts clashed in the starry sky. This was the first large-scale battle in years across the Nine Domains. Both sides fought like waves, annihilating each other instantly and causing countless deaths.

"Kill!" The Demon Lord and Zhou Tianxing wielded their era treasures, vanishing into the void. They clashed with Ming Yongzhi, thunderous explosions echoing as wild waves of power spread outward, annihilating large groups of people.

"Kill! There's no room for retreat now!" Gu Lei and others bore killing intent, forming a small unit like a sharp sword that pierced into the Mortal Domain's army.

"Where is Luotian?" Ming Hun led the nine sons of the Mortal Domain, searching for Gu Lei and others. His voice carried strong battle intent.

After their last encounter with Luotian, Ming Hun had long desired to fight him again. Now that the attack began, but Luotian's absence was felt, leaving Ming Hun disappointed. He believed these allied forces were nothing but a disorganized group. Though they had the advantage in numbers, they were still no match for the Mortal Domain's army.

"Where is Luotian? He's already run away. I'll fight you!" A late-stage sage from the Divine Clan roared, his body glowing with golden light. He approached Ming Hun and directly attacked.

"Boom!" However, the young man had barely moved when he was struck by a gray line. Ming Li's figure appeared in front of everyone.

"You're worthy?" Ming Li's face bore contempt. He punched the divine clan's late-stage sage, sending him flying with a shout. However, his voice was drowned by the battlefield's massive explosions and cries of battle.

"Come with me to eliminate Luotian's friends. I won't believe he'll come out!" Ming Hun's face was cold. He looked at the group led by Nangong Yuying, Cao Dedu, and Gu Lei. He led the remaining eight Mortal Domain sons into the crowd, attacking Nangong Yuying's group.

As the battle in the Thunder Domain began, Luotian sat on a hillside of Severed Spirit Cliff. His body emitted thunderous sounds, and his dantian's vast golden ocean continuously roared.

On the surface of this golden sea, a thread of gray mist floated. It seemed like a single feather in the ocean but gave an eerie feeling. This gray mist was his Devouring Mist, and this boy had used the era power within it to cultivate.

The Devouring Soul Beast's eyes slightly narrowed. It showed a hint of surprise.

"Not enough!" Luotian slowly opened his eyes. He extended his hand, and a black tortoise shell flew out from his palm, hovering above his head.

"Kid, what enemy did you run into this time?" The voice of the Yin Fish spirit echoed in Luotian's mind.

"Not an enemy. I want to borrow your Yin Fish's era power for a moment!" Luotian spoke, his gaze filled with a smile. He could feel he was close to breaking through.

"Good!" Knowing Luotian's intention to break through, the Yin Fish spirit didn't hesitate. It released waves of era power and scattered them over Luotian's body.

"Unity of Heaven and Man!" Luotian remained calm, continuing to cultivate the era power reflected on his body.

Time passed slowly. Three days passed without a sound. The thunderous sounds in Luotian's body vanished, and his golden sage energy ocean calmed down. However, this ocean now contained a thread of gray aura—a more advanced power than sage energy. Though it was just a thread, Luotian knew that some people never cultivated this in their lives.

"This cultivation speed is astonishing. His talent is truly remarkable!" The Devouring Soul Beast's mind was shocked, its massive eyes filled with disbelief.

"Come!" Luotian slowly stood up. The surrounding trees rustled, and wild energy converged toward him. If someone saw this in the star domain, the entire Severed Spirit Cliff would become a massive energy vortex like a black hole, making it impossible to see through.

"It's done!" After absorbing for an hour, Luotian's face finally showed joy. He felt stronger than before the Late Stage Sage level. Now, Luotian was a domain master. Remember, Star Realm's Master and Shiluo Domain's Master were only half-step era-level power. If Luotian's cultivation speed spread, it would surely shock everyone.

"Indeed, the same as Master. His cultivation speed surpasses even Master Zhongli Tian!" The Devouring Soul Beast muttered inwardly.
