“嗡……” A terrifying wave surged forth, like a sea of chaos, surging into Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian’s eyes glistened with tears as he gazed upon the familiar faces, his expression tinged with reluctant sorrow. “All of you, I Luo Tian swear again today—within ten years, I shall return to the Heaven-Origin Continent!”

“Enough. Now it’s our turn,” Zhang Daotian nodded, clutching a formation banner in his hand as he soared toward the northern domain.

At the same time, the Demon Lord, Yin Tianxiong, and Xiang Tianming simultaneously flew toward other domains.

“Master!” Luo Tian’s face twisted with bitterness. He understood what the four of them were about to do—each was closely tied to him, and he could not bear to watch them vanish.

“Haha! Master, now that the Moon-Viewing Sect has been destroyed, I too must make a choice like you once did—protect my disciples!” Zhang Daotian’s gaze carried a touch of sorrow, yet his aura soared into the sky above the northern domain.

“Let my lifeblood and soul be consumed, forging an eternal seal to imprison all living beings of the Heaven-Origin Continent!” Four deep roars echoed across the four domains of the Heaven-Origin Continent, resounding throughout its expanse.

Four streaks of light pierced heaven and earth, enveloping the entire Heaven-Origin Continent. Jiang Nanxuan stood upon the ground, his gaze heavy with depth.

The price paid by the Heaven-Origin Continent was the lives of Zhang Daotian and three other elder Realm-Transcendents.

“Master! Demon Lord!” The people of the Heaven-Origin Continent bore faces of grief, recalling all that the four elders had done for their land. Their hatred burned fiercely.

“It’s not enough—only four Realm-Transcendents, it’s still not enough!” Jiang Nanxuan held a formation banner in his hand, his expression resolute.

“I’ll go!” Gu Lei and Long Jie suddenly flashed forward into the sky, causing Luo Tian’s gaze to tremble further.

“Haha! I never imagined my decades of scheming would end up benefiting another—my resentment is endless, my despair boundless! I’ve always been the one to outwit others; no one has ever outwitted me, not even a Supreme Sage!” Yang Huanyu’s frenzied form soared into the sky, his gaze locking onto the robed figure standing by the Book of Epochs.

Chapter 740: I’ll Help You Once ( )

Chapter 740: I’ll Help You Once

Above the western sky of the Heaven-Origin Continent, Yang Huanyu glared at the robed figure standing beside the Book of Epochs, his body transforming into a streak of light that surged toward the void.

“Luo Tian, ever since you emerged, we’ve been at odds. You are truly a rare genius—this I admit; most people at your age haven’t achieved what you have!”

“Though we’ve clashed, I must admit I admire you. Though I failed, I won’t let them succeed—no Supreme Sage shall make me bow to them. Thus, I’ve decided this time… I’ll help you!” Yang Huanyu’s face twisted with grotesque determination, his voice echoing in the ears of all.

Luo Tian gazed at Yang Huanyu’s changed demeanor, his expression filled with admiration. Decades of scheming had led to a fate opposite to his desires—Luo Tian felt deep sympathy for Yang Huanyu’s plight, but that did not erase the blood debt of the Heaven-Origin Continent.

Before Luo Tian could ponder further, Yang Huanyu’s face bore resolve and boundless hatred as he ignited his entire being, his eyes darkened with a strange hue.

Yang Huanyu recalled his youth, the memories of his old sect—until the Book of Epochs appeared, delivering a crucial revelation: the Book required blood to awaken, and after its activation, it would connect with the Immortal Realm.

This revelation spread across the Moon-Viewing Continent, inciting its people into frenzy. Yang Huanyu’s nature shifted drastically, becoming cold-blooded and ruthless, forging the current merciless Moon-Viewing Ancestor through bloodshed.

The thought of his years of killing, of siblings turning on each other, leading the Moon-Viewing Continent to destruction without achieving his goal left Yang Huanyu heartbroken.

“Luo Tian! I only beg one thing—when your cultivation reaches the heavens, and you enter that legendary Immortal Realm, please take my Yell-Of-The-Dead Halberd and bury it within the Immortal Realm!” Yang Huanyu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears as a red light surged into his presence.

Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with complexity, gazing at the now-vanished Yang Huanyu before swiftly placing the Yell-Of-The-Dead Halberd into his storage ring.

“Those who suffer must have their faults,” Luo Tian sighed, his gaze cold as he stared at the robed figure in the sky.

“嗡……” The aura of a half-Supreme Sage flared, how terrifying it was! Combined with the energy from Zhang Daotian and the three others who had burned everything, it finally encircled the entire Heaven-Origin Continent.

“Seal! Seal this mountain, this water!”
“Seal! Seal this time, all living beings of the Heaven-Origin Continent!”
“Seal! Seal this space, this cycle of rebirth!” Deep roars echoed from Yang Huanyu’s mouth as his formation banner glowed with strange fluctuations, emanating waves from the four directions of the Heaven-Origin Continent.

“Luo Tian, may you travel safely! With the chaotic power of all people of the Heaven-Origin Continent, we’ll build a long时空 tunnel to send Luo Tian out of the Heaven-Origin!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore hope as he gazed at Luo Tian in the sky.

“嗡……” The gray chaotic power within Luo Tian’s body roared forth, piercing through the void to form a long时空 tunnel before him.

“Go! Go! Remember, you are our pride! We await your return on the day you become a supreme sage, surpassing all beings and granting our Heaven-Origin Continent one era of peace!” The people of the Heaven-Origin Continent roared loudly, their gazes flickering as they watched Luo Tian in the sky.

“Want to leave? I never let you go—do you have the right to depart?” The robed figure sneered, dark energy swirling as he gazed at Luo Tian by the passage, his palm striking with overwhelming might.

“Seal!” The immense sealing power gradually formed; Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore a faint smile as he waved to Luo Tian.

“Wait for me!” Luo Tian ignored the apocalyptic palm strike of the robed figure, his eyes glistening with tears as he strode into the chaotic-formed passage.

“Self-destruct!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore a faint smile as his gray soul emerged from his former body, his flesh soaring into the sky toward the middle-aged man’s black palm. His body emitted a thunderous explosion.

“Boom!” The deafening sound of the Realm-Transcendent’s self-destruction was immense. Though the robed figure was powerful, within the Heaven-Origin Continent, he had been constrained to a half-Supreme Sage’s level—his power could not be fully unleashed.

Jiang Nanxuan’s former body’s self-destruction transformed into a terrifying storm, shattering the robed figure’s casual strike and rushing toward him.

“Foolish Realm-Transcendent self-destruction—do you think it can harm me?” The robed figure sneered, his gaze filled with contempt as he extended a hand to dispel the self-destruction’s power.

“Still managed to escape? No matter, no matter where you run, it’ll be useless!” The robed figure sneered again, his gaze now fixed on Jiang Nanxuan.

“Since he’s escaped, you scum can die too!” The robed figure chuckled, his aura surging into the sky like a dark cloud that obscured the entire western sky.

“Too late! Seal the Heaven-Origin Continent!” Jiang Nanxuan’s gray soul bore a faint calm as he spoke.

As his voice faded, the sealing power that had been slowly rising suddenly surged upward, rendering the entire Heaven-Origin Continent motionless.

The people of the Heaven-Origin Continent maintained their previous actions, and the broken cycle passage no longer sent souls outward.

The countless冥域 (Underworld) warriors who had been slaughtering across the Heaven-Origin Continent stood still, some even maintaining their killing gestures.

“Damn! I was careless—never imagined such a small Heaven-Origin Continent could have someone unleash this seal!” The robed figure, upon the formation of the powerful sealing power, returned to his original form, his contemptuous face finally revealing a trace of surprise.

“Foolish insects! Wait—this seal won’t last long. When I return to the Underworld and restore my peak strength, breaking this seal will be effortless!” The black-robed man transformed into a wisp of dark energy, ignoring his subordinates as he soared into the portal formed by the Book of Epochs.

Yet this journey, which should have taken only a thought, took the robed figure nearly thirty breaths before he finally entered the portal of the Book of Epochs.

As for the robed figure’s subordinates, they were all left behind on the Heaven-Origin Continent, frozen in place.

Suddenly, the entire Heaven-Origin Continent fell deathly silent—everyone remained in their pre-seal postures, as if time had frozen.

Luo Tian’s face bore a bitter expression; he knew the Heaven-Origin Continent might now be sealed, and his path through the chaotic passage was uncertain.

Luo Tian also knew this world likely had many continents, like the ancient仙古大陆 (Xian Gu Continent) that once connected with the Heaven-Origin Continent.

The Heaven-Origin Continent and Xian Gu Continent were but a fraction of countless realms, perhaps even pitifully weak.

Time flowed slowly as Luo Tian allowed the chaotic energy-formed passage to carry him, endlessly transporting him.

This was his first time leaving the Heaven-Origin Continent; though he had once visited the Xian Gu Continent, it had already perished. Luo Tian did not know where he would end up, and with the Heaven-Origin Continent sealed, his mood remained heavy.

“One day… two days…” Three days passed before the chaotic energy faded, and Luo Tian appeared in the void without encountering any continent as expected.

“Trouble!” Upon arrival, Luo Tian immediately realized the problem was grave.

In the Heaven-Origin Continent, his strength allowed him to briefly traverse the void, but only for a day. Though the terrifying spatial turbulence in the void posed no danger to him, the most fatal issue was that there was absolutely no energy within the void.

Luo Tian stood in the void, his face dark as he surveyed the surrounding planets, unsure of where to go. His vast spiritual sense probed outward, revealing all within a ten-thousand-li radius in his mind.

“One day… I only have one day! If I don’t find a livable continent within that time, I may perish in this endless void!” Luo Tian’s heart raced as he searched desperately for a continent with energy.

After half a day, Luo Tian quickly became disheartened; his speed was unparalleled, yet after traveling for half a day, he found no continent with energy or human presence.

“Huff…” Luo Tian stood on a piece of land, taking a long breath. This continent was barren to the extreme; its size was no more than half that of the Heaven-Origin Continent, and Luo Tian estimated it to be roughly the size of昆仑山 (Kunlun Mountain) in the East.

“A trace of energy!” Luo Tian’s face lit up, sensing a faint trace of energy on this continent. Though it was extremely thin, it still existed.

“Good news!” Luo Tian wasted no time, absorbing all the energy on this continent into his body to replenish his consumption from traveling half a day, then rose again to seek a long-term dwelling.

Luo Tian moved back and forth along the way, always heading in one direction. The good news was that as he searched, more energy-rich continents emerged—though thin, they still existed, enough for him to endure.

On the third day of his journey, a continent covered in black soil caught Luo Tian’s interest.

“嗡……” A black hurricane swept past Luo Tian, causing his eyes to gleam with joy.

He grabbed a handful of the black soil, rubbing it gently—intense darkness attribute energy seeped into Luo Tian’s body.

Chapter 741: Black Rock Continent ( )

Chapter 741: Black Rock Continent

Luo Tian’s face lit up not only because the soil contained intense darkness attribute energy but also because he sensed a sealing barrier on this continent. He could feel that even he would find it extremely difficult to dig through the ground.

“Since there’s a barrier, that means someone has been here—therefore, nearby must be a continent suitable for dwelling and cultivation!” Luo Tian muttered quietly, sitting cross-legged on the black ground to absorb the darkness attribute energy from the black soil.

Time passed without notice; seven days had elapsed, and Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly. Within a hundred-li radius, the darkness attribute energy from both the ground and beneath it had been completely absorbed by Luo Tian.

Yet this did not bring him joy, as his body had become nine attributes—nine dragon offspring-formed attribute meridians circulating in his body created a peculiar cycle, allowing him to convert any single attribute into the other eight, ultimately transforming into gray chaotic energy that flowed into his elixir field.

“Since no one has come, I’ll first absorb all the darkness attribute energy on this continent. If the energy is sufficient, I’ll find a continent to ascend to Supreme Sage!” Luo Tian muttered quietly, standing up to move elsewhere.

But as he was about to rise, a series of breaking sounds echoed from the distant void—dozens of young people with powerful fluctuations appeared within Luo Tian’s spiritual sense.

Luo Tian did not hesitate, his vast spiritual sense covering himself entirely, making his figure vanish into the black continent.

“Haha! Brother Yang is truly strong—he silenced all other continents’ scum, and finally, our White Tiger Continent secured this Black Rock Continent. Without Brother Yang, we wouldn’t have such good fortune!”

“Indeed! A thirty-year-old Realm-Transcendent—who else can match that? Our entire White Tiger Continent has no one with such achievements!” The flattery echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, causing his brows to furrow slightly.

Among the praises, Luo Tian’s spiritual sense caught sight of a young man with an indifferent expression. A fierce aura formed in Luo Tian’s perception, making him slightly surprised.

These young people were rugged in appearance and wore different attire than himself. It wasn’t that their clothing was strange, but among the dozen people—men and women alike—they all wore long robes. The oddity was that each of them had a white, multicolored tiger embroidered on their bodies.

“White Tiger?” Luo Tian gazed at the familiar white tiger, recalling the White Tiger he had once taken out of the Locking Soul Pagoda and given to Long Jian’s couple. The White Tiger had lived with other fierce beasts of the Heaven-Origin Continent. During the great battle, he had arrived late but witnessed the White Tiger’s tremendous transformation. Yet Luo Tian knew these people might belong to a certain clan, possibly worshiping the White Tiger—yet they were likely unrelated to the one he had saved.

Luo Tian remained hidden, concealing his aura and form completely; these people’s highest cultivation was only Realm-Transcendent, unable to detect him.

A dozen people, under Luo Tian’s observation, landed on a small black hill thirty li away.

“Hmm?” Upon landing, the young man in front bore a look of confusion.

“This place has been visited before!” The man named Yang’s face showed slight bewilderment, then cautiously scanned the surroundings.

The others also reacted with shock, their gazes sweeping across the area, sensing that the darkness attribute energy within a hundred-li radius had vanished.

“Wenbin! Should we inform the sect?” A woman spoke to the front man, the only one who addressed him by name. The others called him Brother Yang, and her tone was intimate, clearly indicating a close relationship with Yang Wenbin.

“No need! A hundred-li area—no need to worry. I’m sure this person has already left. If he hasn’t, with the size of this continent, we’ll meet him within a month. Then we’ll see what to do—our White Tiger Sect’s things aren’t so easily taken!” The young man’s face bore a cold smile.

This Black Rock Continent was a treasure, one he had fought fiercely to win from other continents’ geniuses. He aimed to absorb its intense darkness attribute energy and excavate the minerals beneath the surface.

“Brother Yang is truly formidable! That person must have seen Brother Yang coming and fled, unwilling to stay any longer!” The others began praising again.

“Enough! Disperse! You are the first to arrive at this Black Rock Continent—naturally, you understand the benefits. The Tongming Stone you excavate will be given to me half, and the rest you keep!” Yang Wenbin smiled, addressing the dozen young people.

“Such a greedy one!” Hearing Yang Wenbin’s words, the dozen youths who had grasped a trace of chaotic energy inwardly cursed but smiled flatteringly. They knew how difficult it was to reach this Black Rock Continent.

“嗡……” Waves surged forth as the dozen people transformed into streaks of light around the Black Rock Continent.

“Tongming Stone!” Luo Tian remained hidden, his mind shaken—unbelievable, this seemingly unremarkable continent had Tongming Stone beneath it.

“Haha! That Yang fellow isn’t a good person at all, with that fierce gaze of his. You think you can hide it from me?” Luo Tian inwardly sneered.

Tongming Stone was definitely a precious item; even Luo Tian had seen its records in the Book of Epochs.

Tongming Stone connected to the Profound, and one piece could not only refine weapons but also allow one to comprehend space.

Luo Tian now understood that the strength of a Supreme Sage lay in comprehending the Dao. The Dao was an abstract concept—such as the Time Dao, Space Dao, etc.—which were major Dais. Water and Fire Dais were minor ones.

Once one comprehended a single Dao, they became a Single-Dao Supreme Sage; two Dais made them a Double-Dao, and so on. Though it seemed simple, some Realm-Transcendent masters spent their entire lives without grasping a single Dao, dying in despair.

Space Dao was one of the major Dais; Luo Tian naturally felt a strong desire for it. With his urgent need to enhance his strength, he would not miss any opportunity.

His spiritual sense had now reached the Single-Dao Supreme Sage level; his physical body, after a little refining, would reach the Supreme Sage level. His energy was also abundant.

Luo Tian was confident he had deeply felt the Wood Dao, and with a little contemplation, he could grasp it. However, it was still a minor Dao. If he also comprehended the Space Dao, then upon entering the Supreme Sage level, he would become a Double-Dao Supreme Sage.

With his attribute advantage, Luo Tian was confident he could face Triple-Dao masters—though not necessarily defeating them, a Double-Dao Supreme Sage would escape from a Triple-Dao one.

“Let’s go! Remember to stay in front of me; when the time comes, just absorb energy. I’ll use my ancestral artifact to convert this darkness attribute energy into normal energy for you to absorb. After absorbing all the energy of this Black Rock Continent, you’ll likely reach Realm-Transcendent.”

Yang Wenbin spoke tenderly, his fierce gaze now softened as he looked at the woman before him.

“Wenbin, I promise—if I truly reach Realm-Transcendent, I’ll marry you!” The woman’s face bore a soft expression as she leaned against Yang Wenbin’s chest.

“Haoyue, I…” Feeling the softness in his arms, Yang Wenbin seemed ignited, about to bite her lips.

But the woman subtly slipped out of his arms, evading Yang Wenbin’s mouth, her face showing a trace of shyness: “Wenbin, when we’re married, everything will be yours!”

“Good!” Yang Wenbin was no doubt a Realm-Transcendent master; he recovered quickly, nodding and suppressing his desire. He took the woman’s hand and vanished from the spot.

“Finally gone!” Sensing their departure, Luo Tian appeared at the spot, his face bearing a smile. Now he had no interest in this darkness attribute energy but was instead deeply intrigued by the Tongming Stone beneath this continent.

“I’ll go find it too! This place has no owner, nor is it just your sect’s!” Luo Tian spoke and concealed himself again, appearing beneath the ground instantly.

“Hmm?” As Luo Tian’s body just submerged underground, the woman named Haoyue who had been held by Yang Wenbin furrowed her brows slightly, turning to glance at Luo Tian’s direction.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing Haoyue pause with her brows furrowed, Yang Wenbin asked关切ly.

“Nothing… I just felt the storm was too strong!” Haoyue’s eyes gleamed with a smile, offering an excuse.

“Too strong wind? Let it disperse!” Yang Wenbin sneered, waving his hand. An invisible fluctuation spread from his palm.

The black storm that had been thirty li behind Luo Tian exploded, turning into swirling dark mist and vanishing from the Black Rock Continent.

“Let’s go!” Yang Wenbin again took Haoyue’s hand, heading forward. Yet Haoyue’s eyes bore a trace of contemplation, as if thinking of something, her eyes narrowing into a crescent shape.

Yang Wenbin, seeing this, thought it was because he had done something for Haoyue that made her happy. He felt secretly delighted.

“This woman is strange…” Luo Tian, now deep underground three thousand zhang, bore confusion on his face as he inwardly pondered.

Chapter 742: What Do You Say? ( )

Chapter 742: What Do You Say?

Luo Tian bore confusion, standing beneath the surface of the Black Rock Continent as he sighed: “Well, a Realm-Transcendent—should they provoke me, I won’t mind sending these dozen people to the afterlife!”

Luo Tian moved like a diligent miner, continuously穿梭 (piercing) through the underground of the Black Rock Continent in search of Tongming Stone.

So did the dozen young people who had come with Yang Wenbin, moving underground as well.

As for Yang Wenbin and the woman named Haoyue, they sat on a small hillside, Haoyue’s face calm as a three-zhang-tall white tiger statue stood before them.

If Luo Tian saw it, he would be astonished—this statue stood on the black ground, continuously absorbing the intense darkness attribute energy from the earth.

Yet something strange had occurred; instead of emitting darkness, it spewed normal energy for Haoyue to absorb.

Yang Wenbin gazed at Haoyue’s curvaceous figure with a痴迷 (addicted) expression, carefully guarding her.

“Found it!” Luo Tian, after descending thousands of zhang underground and reaching twenty thousand zhang deep, finally discovered a Tongming Stone the size of a palm.

A palm-sized Tongming Stone lay still there, and Luo Tian’s figure appeared before it. He grasped the stone with his hand, a look of joy on his face.

“嗡……” As Luo Tian held the stone in his hand, his face slightly trembled, sensing he was in a special space.

“This is the material for a storage ring!” Luo Tian’s mind stirred, retrieving his master’s storage ring.

Previously, he had given the storage ring to Gu Qianshi, instructing her to deliver its contents to the people of the Heaven-Origin Continent. Later, when he returned, with his spear and Gu Qianshi naturally returned the ring to him.

At this moment, as Luo Tian held the Tongming Stone in his hand, he knew it was the material for a storage ring.

“Excellent!” Luo Tian had no time to deeply comprehend it, placing the stone into his storage ring and continuing his search.

……

Meanwhile, the dozen people Yang Wenbin had brought also continuously descended underground, each achieving different results. After a day of searching, some returned empty-handed while others found only one stone.

“Ten thousand zhang… twenty thousand zhang… thirty thousand zhang…” Luo Tian continued descending, but apart from the first stone he found, there were no other discoveries.

Until Luo Tian reached fifty thousand zhang underground, he finally discovered another Tongming Stone—this time, it was a one-zhang-high stone that left him stunned and then overjoyed.

“My heavens, so large!” Luo Tian muttered quietly, his gaze fixed on the one-zhang-high Tongming Stone standing before him.

“With this stone, when I enter the Supreme Sage level, I’ll surely comprehend the Space Dao!” Luo Tian waved his hand, placing the one-zhang-high stone into his storage ring.

“Hey! Give me that Tongming Stone!” A triumphant voice echoed from behind Luo Tian, causing his brows to furrow slightly.

He turned around and saw two young men behind him, relieving his tension—earlier, he had been so excited about the stone that he forgot to release his spiritual sense, allowing them to take advantage.

He hadn’t sensed their presence behind him, thinking they were some great power—after all, in the stars beyond, it was different from the Heaven-Origin Continent. He should be careful, and that wasn’t wrong.

“Are you telling me to hand over the Tongming Stone?” Luo Tian’s face bore a faint smile as he gazed at them, waiting for their next move. If they were truly overbearing, Luo Tian would not hold back, regardless of their background or identity.

“Three breaths—don’t hand it over and you’ll die!” The two had only grasped a trace of chaotic energy, reaching the peak of spiritual essence. They couldn’t sense Luo Tian’s half-Supreme Sage strength, and with Luo Tian so young, they didn’t regard him seriously.

“Alas!” Luo Tian sighed, his gaze cold as he looked at the two men. To him, they were no different from insects.

“Then you two shall die!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed like a decree, his aura rising sharply. His domain expanded, enveloping an area of a thousand zhang.

“Realm-Transcendent!” Upon sensing Luo Tian’s aura, the two men who had previously been arrogant now bore expressions of disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian.

They hadn’t seen Realm-Transcendent masters often, but Yang Wenbin above the ground was one. He was a top-tier Realm-Transcendent, renowned across several nearby continents.

Yet they hadn’t expected to encounter a Realm-Transcendent master underground, and this one was even younger than Yang Wenbin.

“Quickly call Brother Yang!” One young man spoke, smashing the jade token on his waist. The two men flashed away in different directions to escape, facing a Realm-Transcendent master with no desire to fight. They had even burned their lifeblood.

But would Luo Tian grant them the chance? In his nine-color domain, he was the sovereign within a thousand zhang. Luo Tian simply stood still, extending both hands and pulling back.

Two streaks of light appeared before Luo Tian, their faces filled with fear as they gazed at him.

“Did you want me to die?” Luo Tian’s face bore a playful expression as he looked at the trembling two young men.

“You can’t kill us—we are disciples of the White Tiger Continent’s White Tiger Sect. If you kill me, the entire White Tiger Continent will hunt for you!” One young man knew they couldn’t escape and thus invoked their background, the sect that dominated the White Tiger Continent.

“White Tiger Continent?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He knew nothing about continents beyond the Heaven-Origin Continent. Though he didn’t know how powerful the White Tiger Continent was, seeing that Yang Wenbin had reached Realm-Transcendent at thirty years old, he realized the White Tiger Continent likely had Supreme Sage masters.

“White Tiger Sect? Does it have a Supreme Sage?” Luo Tian’s face showed no expression as he gazed at the two young men.

“You’ve never heard of the White Tiger Sect?” Hearing Luo Tian’s question, the two young men bore expressions of disbelief. They couldn’t believe this cold-eyed youth hadn’t heard of the White Tiger Sect on the White Tiger Continent.

“I advise you to let us go—our sect’s master is a Supreme Sage, his strength already at seven-source Supreme Sage. You can’t afford to provoke him!” The young man quickly spoke to Luo Tian, fearing he didn’t know the terror of the White Tiger Sect.

“And our sect’s elders are also Supreme Sage-level masters, their strength beyond imagination!” Seeing Luo Tian remained unmoved, the young man continued.

“Supreme Sage!” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly—unbelievable, the White Tiger Sect was so powerful.

A Supreme Sage is anyone who reaches five-source—meaning they are the ultimate sage of the heavens. Their strength was terrifying.

Below five-source, they were called Earthly Supreme Sages. However, no matter what kind of Supreme Sage it was, Luo Tian couldn’t handle them at the moment.

“Who are you?” Just as Luo Tian was thinking, a cold voice echoed in his ears, causing his brows to tighten. He gazed toward the front.

Yang Wenbin and the woman named Haoyue appeared before him, both faces filled with seriousness.

At this moment, Haoyue had become a Realm-Transcendent master; she gazed at Luo Tian with a trace of admiration, while Yang Wenbin extended his hand, summoning a three-pronged two-edged sword in his palm. The blade’s tip glowed with cold light, clearly a high-grade heavenly weapon.

Behind them were the remaining dozen young disciples Yang Wenbin had brought, all gazing at their trembling companions before Luo Tian.

“Hey! You’re a scum, hand over our people and kneel to Brother Yang to apologize—this matter is settled!” The young disciples who had followed Yang Wenbin closely shouted, addressing Luo Tian.

To these dozen disciples, Luo Tian was strong but could never compare to Yang Wenbin.

“Silence!” Yang Wenbin slapped the most vocal disciple away, his face dark as he gazed at Luo Tian. Others couldn’t sense Luo Tian’s half-Supreme Sage strength, but Yang Wenbin could.

Though he had seen many half-Supreme Sages and suppressed them before, Yang Wenbin still felt Luo Tian was no ordinary person.

“Sir, this Black Rock Continent is our White Tiger Sect’s territory. I hope you’ll hand over the Tongming Stone you obtained, and we can keep it peaceful!” Yang Wenbin, a genius of the White Tiger Sect, didn’t directly attack after sensing Luo Tian was trouble.

“Indeed a person of character!” Luo Tian inwardly nodded, appreciating Yang Wenbin’s actions. By directly placing himself in the position of trespassing on another’s land, he clearly indicated this continent was theirs. Thus, taking their belongings naturally required returning them.

Would Luo Tian hand it over? Of course not. He knew if he wasn’t a half-Supreme Sage but just a spiritual essence peak disciple, Yang Wenbin would never have spoken this way. And he wouldn’t have survived a few breaths.

“No— I didn’t get any Tongming Stone!” Luo Tian’s face bore a faint smile, neither denying nor admitting.

“Brother Yang lied—he got a one-zhang-high Tongming Stone!” One of the young men captured by Luo Tian shouted, causing Yang Wenbin’s face to slightly tense.

“Boom!” The moment the young man spoke, he transformed into a mist of blood and seeped underground.

“I said I didn’t get it! I didn’t get it! Is that true?” Luo Tian’s cold gaze met the other young man, his voice carrying a chill.

Chapter 743: I Am Long Haoyue ( )

Chapter 743: I Am Long Haoyue

Seeing Luo Tian kill his companion so easily, including Yang Wenbin, everyone’s faces slightly changed, their gazes filled with disbelief. They hadn’t expected anyone to dare kill a disciple of the White Tiger Sect.

Yet Luo Tian seemed unaffected, his gaze playful as he addressed the other young man: “Tell me, what did I get?”

“N-no… I didn’t get it!” The young man spoke softly, his gaze toward Luo Tian filled with terror. He felt that if he said the same as his companion, he would truly die.

“See? Your companions all say I didn’t get anything. Can I leave now?” Luo Tian addressed Yang Wenbin, his face smiling.

“Haha! This is the first time in years someone has dared to provoke my White Tiger Sect. Today, even if you are a half-Supreme Sage, you won’t leave!” Yang Wenbin’s face bore coldness as he swung his three-pronged two-edged sword.

“After all this talk, it seems we must fight. Since so, I’ll go big—White Tiger Sect, later!” Luo Tian showed no fear, his spear emitting a hum as it landed in his hand.

“I’ll see what you half-Supreme Sage can do!” Yang Wenbin’s face also bore battle intent as he gazed at Luo Tian.
