“Hmph, little brats. I won’t hold it against them!” Old Sa Man spoke, their centuries of existence rendering them immune to Qi Yuanzheng’s scheming. Their faces bore smiles as they gazed upon Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue.

Yet within their hearts, they harbored disdain for Qi Yuanzheng’s methods. To be so old and resort to such clumsy tactics was truly shameful.

“Why have you come to our Star Moon Divine Clan?” Fu Wenbin smiled, utterly dismissing Qi Yuanzheng and his three companions as he addressed Old Sa Man directly.

“Fu Wenbin, during our time in the Thunder Sea Marsh, much has transpired within the Mortal Domain. I hear my son was slain by your Star Moon Divine Clan. Should you not offer us an explanation?” Qi Yuanzheng’s face was cold as he addressed Fu Wenbin, his eyes brimming with intense hatred.

Chapter 1658: Threats

“Hah!” Fu Wenbin let out a long laugh, his eyes flashing with coldness as his aura surged.

“You six royal clans gathered the ancient tribes to attack our Star Moon Divine Clan, overwhelming us with armies. Now you turn around and accuse us? How dare you come to our clan seeking answers! Do you think we lack a Divine King’s heir?” Fu Wenbin’s anger flared as he recalled the past. Had it not been for Luo Tian’s arrival, their clan would have already fallen or changed hands.

Fu Wenbin’s words carried greater authority than Qi Yuanzheng’s, his voice booming and shaking the skies.

“I’ve already shown you enough courtesy by not killing them all. What? Do you wish to test us?” Fu Wenbin’s icy gaze swept over the six, including Old Jingu and Old Sa Man.

“Brother Wenbin, don’t be angry. We’ve come to clarify the truth,” Old Jingu smiled as he addressed Fu Wenbin.

“Hearing that the human clan’s boy has returned to the Mortal Domain again?” Old Sa Man’s eyes held a complex expression as he gazed at Fu Wenbin.

“Colluding with the human clan, Fu Wenbin. How do you explain this?” Qi Yuanzheng, Yu Buxiu, and Hun Zhengqing stood united, their gazes fixed on Fu Wenbin.

“Human clan? Where is he? I’m unaware!” Fu Wenbin’s face bore mockery, his refusal to acknowledge the truth evident in his cold eyes.

“Hmph. You deny it!” Seeing Fu Wenbin’s stance, Qi Yuanzheng’s group exchanged smirks. Though Fu Wenbin denied it, all present knew well that Luo Tian was closely allied with the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Don’t know? Can we meet the Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards?” Qi Yuanzheng’s face bore mockery as he addressed Fu Wenbin.

“Xingyang, I’ve long abandoned clan affairs. Go summon the Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards to show these old men!” Fu Wenbin smiled, never once glancing at Qi Yuanzheng’s group but fixating on Old Jingu instead.

“Old Ancestor, our Star Moon Divine Clan hasn’t had a Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guards in years,” Fu Xingyang bowed respectfully, understanding Fu Wenbin’s intent to stage a performance.

“Hmph, old comrade. Don’t play games before us. That boy has now risen to prominence; he cannot be held back!” Old Jingu furrowed his brows, gazing at Fu Wenbin.

“Old fool, you speak of him, but he’s not within our Star Moon Divine Clan!” Fu Wenbin’s face was resolute as he met Old Jingu’s gaze.

Their eyes flashed with a glimmer of spiritual energy, locking for a moment before both withdrew. Old Jingu then spoke: “Take care of yourself. I’ve come to demand him!”

“We of the Jingu Clan have many within your ranks!” Old Jingu sighed, choosing not to dwell on Luo Tian’s matter. At present, the Jingu Clan was under the command of a second-life powerhouse, and he could not interfere much.

“Old friend, our蛮族 (Mantu) youths should also be released to us!” Old Sa Man smiled, addressing Fu Wenbin as well, clearly sharing the same stance as Old Jingu.

“I’ve only come to demand him. As for other matters, we’ll discuss later. However, I’ll grant you this favor!” The elder of the Blood Clan also expressed his stance.

“Damn it!” Hearing their words, Qi Yuanzheng’s group’s expressions shifted slightly. Their purpose in coming with Old Jingu was to incite discord between them and the Star Moon Divine Clan. After all, among the current royal clans, the Star Moon Divine Clan, Jingu Clan, and Blood Clan were the most formidable. While the Mantu Clan was strong, they avoided conflict, with their Divine King’s heir standing on the human clan’s side.

Their three clans were no better, perhaps even worse. The Mantu Clan at least had a Divine King’s heir within their ranks, whereas these three clans had lost their Divine King’s heirs to Luo Tian and his companions. This hatred effectively severed the three clans’ future.

“You three old friends’ faces, I naturally respect. Xingyang, bring forth those from the three clans and their affiliated tribes!” Fu Wenbin addressed Fu Xingyang, who managed these matters.

“Yes…” Fu Xingyang nodded and vanished from their sight.

“As for those three clans’ people, it depends on what price you can offer. Otherwise, our Star Moon Divine Clan won’t keep so many trash!” Fu Wenbin spoke decisively, his voice laced with a killing intent that made Qi Yuanzheng’s group instinctively shiver.

“You…” Hearing Fu Wenbin’s words, Qi Yuanzheng’s group’s faces darkened, but they bit their teeth and forced out the words through gritted jaws.

“What do you want!” Yu Buxiu spoke coldly, having made up his mind. If this matter was unresolved, he would make the Star Moon Divine Clan pay.

“Nothing much. I want Heavenly Witch’s Ice and Nine-Yellow Jade Frost! If you can produce them, everything is fine. If not, forget it!” Fu Wenbin’s face bore coldness as he addressed Qi Yuanzheng’s group.

“What?” Hearing Fu Wenbin’s words, Qi Yuanzheng’s group’s expressions shifted. The Nine-Yellow Jade Frost Fu Wenbin mentioned was unknown to them; how could they produce it?

Luo Tian stood in the hall, his face bearing a touch of gratitude. Fu Wenbin’s two items were indeed the other two herbs mentioned earlier when he had spoken to Fu Wenbin and others—ingredients for the Soul-Eating Pill.

“What do you need these two things for?” Old Sa Man’s face bore confusion as he asked Fu Wenbin.

“Useful, that’s why. Does your Mantu Clan have any?” Hearing Old Sa Man’s question, Fu Wenbin’s eyes lit up. Luo Tian’s Curse-Subduing Pill had been administered by Old Sa Man, so the Mantu Clan might possess these two items.

“Fu Wenbin, don’t be too bold. We’ve never heard of these two things. Where would we find them for you? Hurry and release our three clans’ people, or don’t blame us for uniting against you!” Qi Yuanzheng’s face darkened, his gaze fixated on Fu Wenbin. If their three clans united, they still had a chance to subdue the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Try it. See if our Star Moon Divine Clan fears you!”

“I’ll give you a month. If you can’t obtain these two things, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Fu Wenbin’s face bore disdain, utterly dismissing Qi Yuanzheng’s group.

“Fu Wenbin, don’t be so arrogant. The Star Moon Divine Clan is strong now, but not invincible!” Qi Yuanzheng’s face darkened as if about to drip water. They were currently at a disadvantage, but once their three clans’ second-life powerhouses recovered and united, the Star Moon Divine Clan was nothing.

“Then let’s discuss your Star Moon Divine Clan colluding with that human boy!” The three then shifted the topic to Luo Tian.

“Release our people, and we’ll pretend not to know about this human matter!” Yu Buxiu’s face bore a threatening expression as he gazed at Fu Wenbin.

“Threaten me? I’ve survived countless tribes for so long, and I’m not someone easily threatened!” Fu Wenbin let out a cold laugh.

Fu Wenbin’s words were met with a surge of noise beneath them as Fu Xingyang led the captured people to their feet.

“Old Ancestor, Old Ancestor has come to save us!” The people saw the figures standing in the sky and their faces lit up with excitement.

Darkness had been the most bleak period for them within the Star Moon Divine Clan, especially those who had endured Luo Tian’s needle training. Even after this long, some still hadn’t recovered, their faces pale and bodies swollen.

“Shut up! You’ve embarrassed us enough!” Old Jingu sneered, his gaze sweeping over the people, causing them to shiver involuntarily.

“Alright, you may leave!” Old Sa Man smiled as he extended his hands, sending waves of energy into the captured people’s bodies, lifting their seals and restoring them to freedom.

“Take care of yourself. This is the last time I grant you courtesy. If we meet that boy again, we might have to fight!” Old Jingu sighed softly, gazing deeply at Fu Wenbin before leading his people out of the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory.

“I’m leaving!” The elder of the Blood Clan also bowed to Fu Wenbin before departing with his group.

“I’d like a glass of water. Won’t you mind?” Old Sa Man smiled as he addressed Fu Wenbin, his expression unreadable.

“Of course not!” Fu Wenbin was momentarily stunned but then let out a light laugh, nodding in agreement.

“Why don’t you just leave? You haven’t found what I wanted, yet you still want people?” Fu Wenbin’s face bore coldness as he addressed Qi Yuanzheng’s group.

“Fu Wenbin, don’t be too bold. We can help you find the items, but you must release our people now!” Qi Yuanzheng’s group gritted their teeth, feeling bitter.

“Hmph. Fu Wenbin, I didn’t expect you to be so brazen!” Before their words finished, a thunderous sound echoed from the horizon.

A vast blue hand shattered space, like a mountain, pressing down with immense pressure toward their direction.

“This…” Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly as he felt the overwhelming pressure from that blue hand.

Chapter 1659: Second Life

The blue hand pressed down upon heaven and earth, collapsing space as it descended toward them. In an instant, it landed atop their heads, the immense pressure causing Fu Wenbin’s group to frown.

“Defend!” Fu Wenbin roared. If that blue hand truly landed on the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory, their clan would suffer heavy casualties.

Roaring, Fu Wenbin took flight, as did Fu Tianqing and Fu Xingyang, forming four streaks of light toward the blue hand.

“Open…” Fu Wenbin waved his hands, radiant light rising. Even in daylight, it was dazzlingly bright. His powerful energy surged forth, forming a star that collided with the blue hand.

“Buzz…” Fu Xingyang’s hands released a golden banner, instantly darkening the sky. The Star-Enshrouding Moon Array activated immediately, enveloping all of the Star Moon Divine Clan’s people.

“What’s happening!” The Star Moon Divine Clan’s people felt the sudden darkness of the sky, their faces filled with shock before they saw the blue hand pressing down upon heaven and earth and the four streaks of light flying toward it.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Thunderous sounds erupted, and as the Star Moon Divine Clan’s people trembled, powerful booms echoed from above. Fu Wenbin’s group clashed with the blue hand.

“Puke…” Many of the Star Moon Divine Clan’s people, despite being protected by the array, still had their blood shaken, many spitting out blood.

The violent waves of energy struck the barrier. Fu Wenbin’s group wore solemn expressions as they gazed at an elder who stepped out of the void.

The elder wore blue robes, his head white-haired, eyes cold. His presence exuded an icy aura, and his blue eyes stared at Fu Wenbin’s group without further action but still imparted immense pressure.

“Old Ancestor!” Qi Yuanzheng’s face lit up with joy as he flew toward the elder, bowing respectfully.

“Second-life powerhouse!” Luo Tian stood in the Star Moon Divine Clan’s hall, his face grim. His body tensed; he would act immediately if anything was amiss.

Qi Hongrui, a high-ranking powerhouse of the Qilin Clan, one of those who had attacked Gu Tian’s Divine King. The Qilin Clan’s resources.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, recognizing the blue-robed elder. His mind was in turmoil.

The elder’s aura was immensely powerful, stronger than when the ancient tribes first attacked the human clan by more than double. He had clearly achieved a second life.

What worried Luo Tian was whether other second-life elders from the Thunder Sea Marsh had also emerged. If they did, would they immediately form a barrier against the ancient tribes and attack the human clan?

“Respected elder…” Fu Wenbin’s face bore anger but he still bowed slightly to Qi Hongrui.

“Fu Wenbin, you still call me elder. I’m not worthy of it!” Qi Hongrui sneered, gazing at Fu Wenbin’s group. He was slightly surprised to find the Star Moon Divine Clan had five high-ranking powerhouses.

“Congratulations on your awakening, Old Ancestor!” Qi Yuanzheng’s face bore ecstatic joy, finally finding a pillar of support.

“Respected elder, you’ve arrived. Our three clans’ people have been detained by Fu Wenbin. He’s arrogant!” Yu Buxiu quickly spoke, his gaze filled with respect.

“Fu Wenbin, the ancient tribes are one family. Is this not too much?” Qi Hongrui heard Yu Buxiu’s words, his face cold.

“Or do you think the Star Moon Divine Clan can dominate the ancient tribes now?” Qi Hongrui spoke again, directly pushing the Star Moon Divine Clan to be at odds with all tribes.

“Respected elder, our Star Moon Divine Clan has never harbored such intentions. It was the other clans who united to massacre us. How could we not resist?” Fu Xingyang responded, gazing at Qi Hongrui.

“Get out of my way! What are you?!” Qi Hongrui swung his sleeve, a blue hand striking toward Fu Xingyang’s face.

Fu Xingyang was a high-ranking powerhouse, and even if Qi Hongrui had achieved a second life, he couldn’t easily hit him. His hands glowed with starlight as he clashed with the elder.

“Boom…” Fu Xingyang then retreated, his hands riddled with cracks but quickly healing. His face was grim.

“Dare to fight back? Hurry and release our three clans’ people, or I’ll replace Fu Cangshan’s old man to discipline the younger generation!” Qi Hongrui saw Fu Xingyang return to his group. He admired the Star Moon Divine Clan’s youth but felt resentment toward their Qilin Clan, which had no successors. This made Qi Hongrui even more annoyed at Fu Xingyang’s group.

“Old Ancestor, it’s not just that. You’ve only just awakened. You don’t know yet—this human prodigy is currently within the Star Moon Divine Clan. The entire ancient tribes are aware of this. We previously wanted to kill him, hence coming to the Star Moon Divine Clan.”

“But we didn’t expect them to protect this human boy, hence what followed!” Qi Yuanzheng’s eyes bore mockery as he spoke. Remembering the humiliation he had suffered at Fu Wenbin’s hands, Qi Yuanzheng felt a sense of relief now that he had this powerful pillar.

“Now I understand. Hand over that human!” Qi Hongrui, who already hated Luo Tian, was further enraged by Qi Yuanzheng’s words. His voice carried no room for negotiation.

“Respected elder, he is not within our clan!” Fu Wenbin’s eyes were cold. Though they weren’t in a favorable position, if it came to a fight, they wouldn’t back down.

“Boy, come out. Do you think you’re hiding well?” Qi Hongrui sneered, shouting toward the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, but then a cold smile spread across his face. Having learned from the Blood Clan’s previous attempt to find him, Luo Tian was more cautious now. He was confident that without someone skilled in divination, no one could locate him.

“Lying to me. Though I may not live as long as you, this small trick won’t fool me!” Luo Tian sneered, standing in the hall. Despite Qi Hongrui’s powerful spiritual awareness scanning around, he found no trace of Luo Tian.

Qi Hongrui stood in the sky, his brows furrowed. His current cultivation had reached a high level, yet he still couldn’t find Luo Tian’s presence.

“Respected elder, he is not within our clan. From the start, you’ve accused us of colluding with the human clan, repeatedly humiliating us. Do you truly not regard our Star Moon Divine Clan?” Fu Wenbin stood in the sky, his voice filled with anger.

“Release our people. Let this be settled!” Qi Hongrui scanned again, finding only Fu Xingxuan but no high-ranking spiritual energy.

“Impossible. Even if you are a second-life powerhouse, our Star Moon Divine Clan won’t allow such oppression. If you want people, you must pay the price!” Fu Wenbin spoke coldly. The other side had always acted superior, ignoring them entirely. Even if it was anyone, they would be angry—especially Fu Wenbin, a long-time elder of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Hmph. You’ve grown bold. No longer regard me as an old man!” Qi Hongrui glared at Fu Wenbin’s group, his anger turning into a cold laugh.

“Then I’ll have to resort to force!” Qi Hongrui spoke, his aura gradually rising. The entire world seemed frozen.

“Respected elder, you’ve always spoken of the ancient tribes being one family. Pressuring the Star Moon Divine Clan seems inappropriate, doesn’t it?” Old Sa Man, who had remained silent until now, smiled slightly as he gazed at Qi Hongrui.

“Do you want to get involved too, Mantu?” Hearing Old Sa Man’s words, Qi Hongrui furrowed his brows. He didn’t know what Old Sa Man was up to.

“Respected elder, I’m just an outsider. However, I’ve been watching closely. The Star Moon Divine Clan suffered heavy losses before; they should receive some compensation!” Old Sa Man spoke softly, clearly siding with the Star Moon Divine Clan.

Hearing Old Sa Man’s words, those present fell silent, their gazes thoughtful. Though Fu Wenbin was close to Old Sa Man, he didn’t believe Old Sa Man would risk angering Qi Hongrui for them.

Qi Hongrui, meanwhile, pondered whether Old Sa Man was seeking an alliance with the Star Moon Divine Clan. If so, he would have to reconsider.

“Fine, I’ll accept your conditions. However, we’ll only search for a month. If after one month we still can’t find him, don’t blame us. No matter the outcome, you must release them!” Qi Hongrui sneered, effectively compromising.

“We’re leaving!” Qi Hongrui spoke without hesitation, addressing Qi Yuanzheng’s group. His figure vanished into the distance, no one noticing a subtle smile on his face.

Seeing Qi Hongrui’s group leave, Fu Wenbin’s group’s faces darkened. Though they claimed to search for a month, who knew if they truly would?

Luo Tian stood in the hall, his face filled with surprise. His eyes glowed with intense light.

“Did he do it on purpose?” Luo Tian muttered, excitement in his voice. His mind’s book constantly surged with powerful waves. If he hadn’t suppressed it, the golden book might have already burst out of his body. Such waves only occurred when he discovered a fragment of the Epoch Book.

Chapter 1660: Follow or Not?

“Epoch Book!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, suppressing the Epoch Book in his mind. His eyes bore contemplation—clearly, Qi Hongrui possessed the Epoch Book. Luo Tian had always valued the Epoch Book highly; he wasn’t sure whether to chase after Qi Hongrui’s group. After all, they were second-life powerhouses.

Yet Luo Tian had some confidence. Though Qi Hongrui was powerful, he knew his methods could counter him. Plus, the Epoch Book’s mutual pull would make obtaining Qi Hongrui’s Epoch Book relatively easy.

The sword technique Mei Xueyin had given him was his greatest secret. Luo Tian was certain that if he unleashed it, even a second-life powerhouse would be doomed. After all, it was the ultimate technique of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King.

But Luo Tian worried that using this sword technique would drain him completely. Moreover, the curse he had just suppressed would inevitably resurface. Luo Tian was certain that if it did, he wouldn’t be able to withstand it.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian hesitated, Fu Wenbin’s group returned to the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory.

“Old Sa Man, why are you lingering in our Star Moon Divine Clan?” Fu Wenbin’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Nothing much. I just wanted to meet that boy!” An old voice responded, Old Sa Man’s tone carrying a hint of amusement.

“I’ve already told you he isn’t here!” Fu Wenbin shouted back, still arguing.

“Enough, old friend. Don’t play games with me. I have no ill intent!” Old Sa Man’s voice echoed, and the hall’s door slowly opened. Old Sa Man’s figure appeared in Luo Tian’s line of sight, causing him to startle slightly.

“Old fool, how did you know?” At the same time, Fu Wenbin’s group appeared behind Old Sa Man, their faces grim.

“Divined it!” Old Sa Man stepped into the hall, gazing at Luo Tian. His expression of surprise faded quickly.

“Respected elder!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, unsure how this old man had discovered his presence. However, since he hadn’t exposed him before Qi Hongrui and others, it was clear Old Sa Man had no ill intent.

“Young master, have you been well?” Old Sa Man smiled, his deep gaze unreadable.

“Young master, speak plainly. I have some matters to attend to outside!” Luo Tian addressed Old Sa Man, his heart anxious. He felt the Epoch Book’s waves growing weaker—meaning Qi Hongrui was moving further away.

“I’ve invited the young master to visit our Mantu Clan. Recently, our clan’s Divine King’s heir has returned but encountered some issues. I hope the young master can come and take a look!” Old Sa Man’s eyes bore solemnity.

“Hmph?” Hearing Old Sa Man’s words, Luo Tian’s face shifted. He gazed at Old Sa Man.

“Zhan Biao, what happened to him?” Luo Tian spoke solemnly. They had taken the transmission array set by Wan Lingkong, but they were separated—only Chen Zhanbiao and Wan Lingkong hadn’t returned. They had been searching for them, with Luo Tian most worried about Chen Zhanbiao. He hadn’t expected Chen Zhanbiao to be sent to the Mortal Domain by that scoundrel Wan Lingkong.

“It’s not a major issue. Once you arrive, you’ll see. It seems to be a spiritual soul problem!” Old Sa Man responded, his voice carrying solemnity.

Old Sa Man spoke and then waved his hand. A cold chill swept through the hall, and a black ice block and an icy crystal appeared in his hands. Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy.

“This is the Heavenly Witch’s Ice and Nine-Yellow Jade Frost you needed. I apologize for making you endure the curse. However, our Mantu Clan has lost the method to unlock the Curse-Subduing Pill. I hope these two items will help you!” Old Sa Man spoke softly, handing the two items to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed as he took them. His heart was overjoyed—unexpectedly, the ingredients for the Soul-Eating Pill were already complete.

At this moment, Luo Tian no longer cared about the Epoch Book. After all, Chen Zhanbiao’s safety was his top priority.

“Respected elder, you go back to the Mantu Clan first. Once I’ve lifted the curse, I’ll head to the Mantu Clan!” Luo Tian nodded. Though he worried about Chen Zhanbiao, he was currently in the Mortal Domain and could meet the ancient tribes at any moment. With the curse, he was constrained.

“Hmph, I’ll take my leave then. I’ll wait for you in the Mantu Clan!” Old Sa Man smiled, nodding to Fu Wenbin’s group. After all, the Mantu Clan still needed him to oversee.

“I need to enter seclusion!” Luo Tian watched Old Sa Man leave, then spoke to Fu Wenbin’s group. He vanished into the void.

Luo Tian then sat cross-legged in the void, adjusting his state. It had been a long time since he last cultivated. The Soul-Eating Pill was a high-grade divine-level elixir, and he needed to invest much energy. Five main herbs were only available in one set; he had to be careful.

“Sigh…” Seeing Luo Tian vanish into the void, Fu Wenbin’s group sighed deeply. They all were high-ranking powerhouses but had no more to improve—proving one’s status as a Divine King wasn’t about mere cultivation but opportunity. From the ancient times, many high-ranking powerhouses existed, yet only one Divine King per epoch.

Meanwhile, outside the Star Moon Divine Clan’s domain, faint waves spread from the void.

“Is that boy really in the Star Moon Divine Clan? Why hasn’t he come out yet?” A low voice echoed, filled with intense hatred.

“Wait. I don’t believe anyone would ignore the Epoch Book!”

“No one can remain indifferent to the Epoch Book. That boy has it; he won’t miss this chance!” An old voice responded, and the void fell silent again.

Time flowed slowly. Luo Tian sat for seven days, his mind calm as he opened his eyes.

“Tianji Flame Vessel!” Luo Tian smiled, this being his first time using the elixir vessel. The Seven-Star Thunder Vessel had been returned to Shen Gongfu.

Seven-colored flames erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, rushing into the Tianji Flame Vessel. The scorching atmosphere echoed in the void as Luo Tian’s face bore solemnity. He released a series of herbs.

“Ten… one hundred…” Soon, each herb transformed into refined medicinal liquid under Luo Tian’s powerful spiritual awareness.

“Now, the five main herbs!” Luo Tian sighed softly, then sent the five extremely cold divine herbs into the Tianji Flame Vessel.

“Roar…” Five ice dragons appeared in the vessel, sensing a powerful threat and roaring toward the seven-colored flames.

“Roar…” The Seven-Star Flames were no ordinary fire; they were far superior to the Thunder Flame, forming a seven-colored flame dragon that clashed with the five ice dragons.

Luo Tian’s face bore admiration, his heart also relieved. Fortunately, the Tianji Flame Vessel wasn’t ordinary; otherwise, this cold and hot force would have been unbearable for any elixir vessel.

Time flowed slowly. Though the five divine herbs were rare, they weren’t at the level of immortal herbs. While powerful, they were still inferior to Seven-Star Flames. Though it took time, eventually the seven-colored flames consumed them, forming five droplets of cold liquid floating in the Tianji Flame Vessel.

“Condense…” Luo Tian smiled, but his face was solemn. A booming sound echoed from the vessel.

Luo Tian carefully merged each medicinal liquid, his spiritual awareness rapidly consumed. However, since this was his first time cultivating a high-grade divine-level elixir, though his spiritual awareness was greatly drained, he could still endure it.

“Buzz…” White mist spread from the Tianji Flame Vessel, instantly freezing everything around it. Even Luo Tian shivered involuntarily; even the surrounding gray void currents were frozen, leaving only the seven-colored flames flickering.

“Condense the elixir…” Time passed swiftly, and after seven days, the ice on Luo Tian’s body shattered. Then time seemed to resume. The Tianji Flame Vessel erupted with a thunderous sound.

“Open…” Luo Tian waved his hand, lifting the vessel’s lid. Glorious light spread out, and a pill resembling ice crystals rose from the vessel, surrounded by mist. Black clouds of thunderstorms instantly enveloped the entire void, oppressive energy spreading through it.

“What’s happening? Who is undergoing a thunderstorm?” At the moment the storm clouds formed, shouts echoed from outside the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory. A series of powerful auras spread outward, fearing being caught in the storm clouds. After all, they were high-ranking powerhouses; if they underwent a thunderstorm, it would be the epoch’s trial, which they couldn’t withstand.

“Crack…” Golden lightning descended from the black storm clouds, striking the seemingly weak but icy Soul-Eating Pill.

“Buzz…” However, the golden lightning halted before touching the Soul-Eating Pill and shattered into golden lightning energy, dispersing around.

“Don’t waste it!” Luo Tian smiled as he watched the frozen lightning. He waved his hand, and the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword flew from his hands, hovering above the Soul-Eating Pill.

Chapter 1661: Reward You

“Crack…” Thunderous waves descended from the void, annihilating space as they struck the icy elixir.

But a green long sword hovered above the Soul-Eating Pill, allowing the lightning to descend and emitting endless suction force, continuously absorbing the descending lightning. Each bolt of lightning twisted under the massive suction force of the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword.

“Unexpectedly, the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword has such a function!” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the sword with admiration. As he endured the thunderstorm, the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword’s aura gradually rose but did not produce a third-color lightning. Clearly, the thunderstorm from the Soul-Eating Pill alone wasn’t enough.

“Buzz…” The humming sound echoed. The thunderstorm lasted half an hour, as if it had discovered its purpose of becoming the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword’s nourishment. Finally, it slowly dissipated, and the void returned to silence. The area within a hundred miles of Luo Tian turned into a vacuum.

“Finally succeeded!” Luo Tian smiled, flying toward the Soul-Eating Pill and grabbing it in his hand.

“Difficult indeed!” Luo Tian sighed, without hesitation swallowing the elixir.

After consuming the Soul-Eating Pill, his entire body trembled. A layer of ice shards rose on his body, a powerful extreme coldness that even Luo Tian struggled to withstand.

It was an icy chill capable of freezing souls. Luo Tian didn’t delay, immediately activating the Epoch Power to guide the extreme coldness while making himself feel less cold. If left unchecked, he felt he would be frozen to death.

“This elixir isn’t for ordinary people!” Luo Tian muttered, thinking that if a peak Epoch-level cultivator took it, they would be instantly frozen to death.

The extreme coldness transformed into an ice dragon within Luo Tian’s body, rapidly rushing through his meridians and attacking his spiritual soul.

“Buzz…” The humming sound echoed. A gray flame mark was imprinted on Luo Tian’s gray spiritual soul, as if sensing danger and emitting waves.

“Subdue!” Luo Tian’s gray spiritual soul roared, guiding the coldness from his meridians toward the flame mark.

“Crack…” The next moment, something cracked. Coldness struck the black flame mark on Luo Tian’s chest.

“Boom…” As the coldness struck, the previously sealed soul fire reignited and became even more terrifying. It spread throughout Luo Tian’s spiritual soul, beginning to burn it.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian roared. In an instant, his powerful spiritual soul lost nearly a tenth of its strength—speed was terrifying.

“Sizzle…” Fortunately, the extreme coldness guided by Luo Tian rushed toward his spiritual soul. A series of coldness dragons continuously circled around his spiritual soul, eroding the soul fire that made him want to die.

“Ah…” Luo Tian roared upward, sweat dripping. Two opposing forces turned his spiritual soul into a battlefield, making him scream in pain.

One roar shattered the void. The surrounding space began to collapse as Luo Tian’s continuous roars created violent waves, spreading outward.

“What’s happening…” The people outside the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory, who had thought it was a thunderstorm, looked with shock. They felt the void becoming unstable and noticed distant areas collapsing.

The painful cries echoed throughout the Star Moon Divine Clan’s territory, causing its people to look with surprise.

“Is it the Grand Commander? What is he doing?” The Star Moon Divine Clan’s people saw Luo Tian standing there, roaring continuously, and began to discuss.
