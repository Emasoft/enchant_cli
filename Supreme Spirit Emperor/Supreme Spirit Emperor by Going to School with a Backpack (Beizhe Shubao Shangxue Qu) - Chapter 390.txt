“Fighting spirit—this is why the Nascent Soul of the Battle Saint is so rare! After all, if you're always fighting like this, how could one live long...” Cao Dezhu's face also bore a look of admiration as he spoke softly.

“Ah...” Upon hearing Cao Dezhu's words, Luo Tian and the others' expressions immediately shifted. Though they too had thought this, it was still inappropriate to say so in front of Yao Chen.

“Indeed, we were born for battle. To die in combat is no problem!” Yao Chen spoke softly, his gaze carrying a hint of pride.

“…” Luo Tian and the others felt a pang in their hearts, gazing at Yao Chen. They felt that besides battle, they had nothing else in common with him.

“Brother, you've got it wrong. There are still many beautiful things in the world, like delicious food!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke softly. Though he had fought with Yao Chen for a while, he found him quite likable.

“Haha, well then. When my father was alive, I had already tasted almost every good thing there is! If we have the chance, I'll take you to those places where I remember there were good things. I wonder if they've changed after so many years.” Yao Chen's face broke into a smile, also finding Chen Zhanbiao unusually likable.

“Do you know where your father, the Dragon Emperor Tian, went? Did he ascend or...?” Luo Tian spoke softly, eager to learn the whereabouts of Dragon Emperor Tian.

“My father may have perished!” Upon hearing Luo Tian's question about his father's fate, Yao Chen finally displayed a touch of sorrow.

“Back then, my father pushed through his rivals relentlessly, eventually becoming the Lord of the Epoch. Even after attaining the title of Lord of the Epoch, he never rested, constantly searching for opponents!” Yao Chen spoke softly, his voice laced with nostalgia.

“Even after becoming the Lord of the Epoch, who else could he possibly find as an opponent?” Luo Tian and the others felt a quiet confusion upon hearing Yao Chen's words.

“Indeed, he still sought opponents!” Cao Dezhu sighed, voicing the group's unspoken doubts.

“Of course there were!” Yao Chen looked at Cao Dezhu with disdain before continuing: “My father searched for a million years until he finally found an opponent.”

“Immortals!” Upon hearing Yao Chen's words, Luo Tian and the others were stunned. They could not fathom who else could be an opponent for the Lord of the Epoch.

“My father told me before he sealed me away that he had found an opponent. However, he was unsure of his chances, so he chose to seal me away!”

“He once said that if he won, he would return and unseal my prison to bring me into a new world. If he lost, he would perish! Only when the people of the Dragon Domain awakened me would I be freed!” Yao Chen spoke softly, causing Luo Tian and the others to draw a sharp breath.

“Perhaps the opponent my father found was not an immortal!” Upon hearing Yao Chen's words, Luo Tian recalled what Gu Tianshu had once told him.

“If one wishes to become an immortal, they must defy the heavens!” Luo Tian murmured softly, drawing the group's attention to him.

“What did you say?” Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Yao Chen's expression shifted slightly as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“A senior once told me that. Nothing more, but I don't know what the 'heavens' refer to. Perhaps only those who reach a certain level of cultivation can understand it!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“My father once told me the same thing, saying that if I ever attained enlightenment, I must not be as reckless as him!” Yao Chen spoke, his golden eyes also filled with confusion.

“Do you have any other relatives left?” Luo Tian then asked the question that had been his greatest doubt. He suspected a close connection between the Dragon Emperor and the Nascent Soul of the Battle Saint—too similar to be coincidental.

“No, I suppose not. Our lineage has basically come to an end with me!” Yao Chen spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian: “So, have you seen a Nascent Soul of the Battle Saint somewhere else?”

“Very similar, but I'm not sure. If you have time, go to the Four Sacred Star Domains and verify. If it's truly connected to you, perhaps...” Luo Tian did not finish his sentence but gazed at Yao Chen.

“Do you mean my father might still be alive?” Yao Chen spoke in disbelief, then shook his head, a look of doubt in his eyes.

“The Lord of the Epoch—none of them are without great power, subduing all nine heavens and ten earths. If he's not dead, it's plausible!”

“But that senior has already perished. Now his state seems like he's living a second life, but there's no clear sign!” Luo Tian spoke softly, calming Yao Chen who had become anxious and fidgety.

“Alright,” Yao Chen nodded. Concerning his father, he would not take it lightly and had decided to journey to the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“How does one become an immortal?” Luo Tian murmured softly, then shook his head, dispelling the thoughts from his mind. He turned to Long Jie: “Alright, now we should enter the Dragon Tomb! Retrieve the Dragon Mist Ice—I also need to go to the Shura Domain!”

“Let's leave first. Rest for a day. Though there's no danger in the Dragon Tomb, it's troublesome. I'll go and discuss with a few old masters of the Dragon Clan. Tomorrow, we'll open the Dragon Tomb!” Long Jie nodded and waved his hand. The group's figures vanished from the fragmented small world, returning to the previous grand hall.

After Long Jie left, Luo Tian and the others sat in meditation within the hall to recover. Chen Zhanbiao had expended much energy during his fight with Yao Chen and needed rest.

Time flowed slowly. On the second morning, as the sun rose, Long Jie entered from outside the hall, and Luo Tian and the others gradually opened their eyes, returning to peak condition.

“Let's go. The elders have agreed to open the Dragon Tomb!” Long Jie smiled, leading Luo Tian and the others out of the hall.

Along the way, the Dragon Clan's people bore expressions of reverence. They held Luo Tian in high regard; without him, Long Jie would not have returned to the Dragon Clan, nor could he have ascended to the position of Domain Lord. The Dragon Clan would not have regained its former dominance over the Dragon Domain.

No words were spoken along the way. After a short walk, they arrived at the entrance of the Dragon Tomb—two black dragon carvings stood outside, exuding an imposing presence.

Several elders stood at the entrance of the Dragon Tomb, smiling as they watched Luo Tian and the others approach.

“Hail to the Dragon Emperor!” The elders bowed respectfully to Long Jie, then gazed at Luo Tian and the others who walked beside him. Though Long Jie was now the Domain Lord of the Dragon Domain, Yao Chen might have a chance to challenge him. However, Yao Chen was naturally inclined towards battle and had no interest in the title of Domain Lord.

“Respectful greetings, elders!” Luo Tian bowed to the elders. He had previously had some conflicts with the Dragon Clan, but after Long Jie's return, they were fully reconciled.

“No trouble at all. Without you, our Dragon Clan might still be oppressed and no longer among the Eight Sacred Clans!” The Grand Elder of the Dragon Clan smiled warmly. Regardless of reasons, being on good terms with Luo Tian was undeniably beneficial.

“Alright, open it!” Long Jie spoke calmly. He joined the elders who had already prepared and gazed at the entrance of the Dragon Tomb with reverence.

“Alright!” The elders said nothing more. They moved their hands, and the sound of dragon roars echoed within their bodies. Then they extended their hands, releasing various colored rune dragons from their palms.

“Roar…” As the runes were cast, the two black dragon statues at the entrance of the Dragon Tomb let out deep roars. A powerful pressure spread throughout the world, causing Luo Tian and the others to frown in concentration. Even Yao Chen's gaze turned serious; when he was alive, the Dragon Clan had been strong but not yet dominant.

Two black dragon-like spiritual forms rose into the air, instantly swallowing the runes cast by Long Jie and others before vanishing into the statues.

Long Jie and the elders bore reverence, then extended their hands again. A drop of blood flew from their palms into the eyes of the two black dragons.

Two red glows flickered, and the two dragon statues' eyes slowly opened. A low voice echoed from their mouths: “Why have you reopened the Dragon Tomb again? Disturbing the peace of our ancestors!”

“Latecomer needs the Dragon Mist Ice, so I wish to enter the Dragon Tomb…” Long Jie bowed respectfully and spoke softly.

“The Dragon Tomb was meant to open once every century. You've opened it too frequently recently. This is the last time; next time, you'll have to wait a century!” The dragon statue spoke.

“Yes!” Long Jie responded and nodded at Luo Tian, then stood there with him and the others.

“Buzz…” Four red glows flashed, illuminating Long Jie and the others. In an instant, their figures vanished from the sight of the elders of Long Zǔ.

Chapter 1547: Dragon Tomb Heritage

“Buzz…” A series of humming sounds echoed. Luo Tian and the others appeared in a grand hall, their faces filled with surprise.

Before them stood countless dragon-shaped statues. The vastness of the tomb gave no sense of gloom, instead radiating brilliance with dragon qi swirling overhead.

“Little wonder Long Jie loved shiny things since childhood—he inherited it!” Luo Tian observed the magnificent tomb and chuckled inwardly.

“Hmph, the qi in this Dragon Tomb is truly rich!” Chen Zhanbiao's face bore admiration as he spoke softly.

“Indeed, the qi here is several times stronger than outside. It's the power of our Dragon Clan ancestors who sealed their cultivation within this tomb. Practicing here for a day equals a year outside. That's why Grandpa Cao chose to meditate within this tomb!”

“There are also many inheritances for the descendants of the Dragon Clan to obtain! If you have no other matters, Brother can meditate here for a few days!” Long Jie smiled proudly and spoke to Luo Tian.

“The Dragon Mist Ice we need is a legacy left by an elder within this tomb. Only after passing that elder's test can we obtain the Dragon Mist Ice!” Long Jie continued, explaining where the Dragon Mist Ice was located.

“Let's go. I'll lead you to the place where that elder rests!” Long Jie smiled and spoke to Luo Tian and the others, then stepped forward into the depths of the Dragon Tomb.

“Roar…” A series of dragon roars echoed in Luo Tian's ears. As they had just taken a step, numerous dragon-shaped spiritual forms circled around Luo Tian and the others, rushing toward them.

“Boom…” The spiritual forms collided with Luo Tian and the others' bodies before dispersing, as if attempting to block their path.

“This is just the beginning. The deeper you go, the greater the pressure will be. However, with our cultivation levels, even reaching the deepest parts won't be a problem. Grandpa Cao meditated in the deepest part, and the qi there is even richer!” Long Jie explained again to Luo Tian and the others, but his pace did not slow.

“I want to meditate here!” Yao Chen's face glowed with spiritual light. Any place that could enhance his strength, he would not hesitate to use.

“I support you. Meditate here!” Upon hearing Yao Chen's words, Cao Dezhu quickly spoke, his voice filled with joy.

“Yes, Brother Monkey, you can meditate here. Deeper within are the souls of our Dragon Clan ancestors—each one is immensely powerful. You can challenge them. If you obtain their inheritances, your strength will surely advance another level!” Yan Jun also spoke in agreement, obviously not wanting Yao Chen to bother them further.

“If the people of the Dragon Domain knew that Yao Chen was meditating, they would celebrate for three days and nights!” Cao Dezhu's eyes gleamed with joy, thinking to himself.

Luo Tian and Sun Mengru smiled, secretly sighing at how disliked Yao Chen was in the Dragon Domain.

They walked forward, and the dragon qi grew stronger with each step. Their speed gradually slowed, but the rich qi within it also increased, making them feel a slight growth in their cultivation after just a short walk.

“Here!” After walking for half an hour, Long Jie smiled and arrived at a tomb.

“This is the tomb of one of our Dragon Clan elders. His cultivation reached the peak of the Epoch. He was a rare alchemist in our Dragon Clan. Since ancient times, there have been few alchemists within the Dragon Clan. I don't know how skilled this elder was; it's said he was renowned throughout the Nine Domains!” Long Jie spoke with a dreamy expression, clearly not very familiar with alchemy.

A fiery red dragon coiled above the tomb, radiating a scorching heat that made Luo Tian smile.

“Dragon Roar's Tomb!” The red stone tablet on the tomb bore the name of the deceased and recounted his deeds, densely packed and overwhelming.

“Zhanbiao, Madam, you can look around freely. If you find something suitable for yourself, try to obtain it! Remember, only one person can obtain each tomb's inheritance. Also, don't forcibly break into the tomb; if you do, that inheritance will be lost forever!”

“If you merely obtain the inheritance, after years of accumulation, it may recover. Of course, except for the herbs and treasures you take!” Long Jie smiled and spoke to Sun Mengru and Chen Zhanbiao.

“Unsurpassed, the Dragon Clan!” Luo Tian and the others sighed in admiration, gazing at the dragon-shaped stone figures hovering in the air. With such a foundation, it was no wonder the Dragon Clan was so strong!

“Our Tianyuan Continent is currently prosperous but lacks such places. Places where generations can inherit and benefit their descendants!” Luo Tian sighed deeply.

“Alright, go explore on your own. I'll look around!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to the others.

“Hmm…” The others nodded, leaving Luo Tian's side to explore other areas.

“Dragon Roar!” This name sounded familiar. Why did I think I had heard it before?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, not rushing into the tomb immediately but reading about Dragon Roar's deeds on the stone tablet.

“Dragon Roar, an alchemist of the Dragon Clan. His cultivation reached the peak of the Epoch. He displayed his alchemical talent at a young age, becoming an alchemist rare in the Dragon Clan for centuries. However, the Dragon Clan's alchemy was not very complete. After reaching the early stages of Sainthood, he chose to leave the Dragon Clan and wander through the Nine Domains. Later, he joined Master Meng Yixian of the Fire Domain and studied alchemy under him!”

“Meng Yixian!” Upon reading this, Luo Tian's face suddenly changed. Though he was familiar with the name Dragon Roar, Meng Yixian was a household name to him.

Meng Yixian founded the Fire Domain's Epoch Lord. Luo Tian had heard of Meng Yixian's name from Gu Tianshu. Meng Yixian was not only a master of cultivation but also the top alchemist in the Nine Domains. Gu Tianshu's alchemical skills had once received a fragment of Meng Yixian's legacy.

“Who would have thought this elder was a disciple of the Epoch Lord Meng Yixian!” Luo Tian felt shocked, gazing at the lifelike red dragon above.

“However, Dragon Roar was not a direct disciple of Meng Yixian but was accepted as an honorary disciple. He studied for nearly three centuries before leaving the Fire Domain and returning to the Dragon Domain!”

“After returning, Dragon Roar's alchemical skills soared to a high-level master. He gained the Dragon Clan's attention, greatly increasing their strength. During a great catastrophe in the Dragon Clan, he used his alchemical skills to create many powerful warriors, helping the clan withstand that catastrophe!”

“In his later years, Dragon Roar reached the pinnacle of alchemical skills and attempted to create immortal herbs. However, he failed, his body destroyed and his life lost!” Luo Tian sighed deeply after reading about Dragon Roar's story, admiration on his face.

Even the Dragon Clan now highly valued Dragon Roar's inheritance. If it weren't for Long Jie's connection, the Dragon Clan would never have allowed Luo Tian to choose Dragon Roar's inheritance. The Dragon Tomb, aside from the inheritance of a future king, was most precious for Dragon Roar's.

“Another elder who devoted his life to alchemy!” Luo Tian bowed before the tomb, then extended a hand. Following Long Jie's instructions, he released runes from his palm onto the stone tablet. The red tomb slowly opened, emitting a fresh scent that made Luo Tian's face shift slightly.

“Such rich vitality! It seems this tomb contains many herbs!” Luo Tian murmured to himself, then stepped into the Dragon Tomb.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed. In a moment, Luo Tian appeared before a clean mountain, as if entering another world.

“Finally, someone has entered!” As Luo Tian just landed, a voice echoed in his ears. His face shifted slightly.

“Roar…” A fiery red aura suddenly spread from the mountain top, continuously swirling into a long red dragon that appeared above Luo Tian's head.

“You are not of our clan. How did you enter the Dragon Tomb?” The red dragon coalesced into a spiritual form of an old man, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Latecomer is the brother of the Dragon Emperor. We signed a blood pact, and my body also contains dragon clan's blood!” Luo Tian feared the old man would not let him obtain the inheritance, so he quickly explained his identity. Although the old man was just a spiritual form and could be destroyed with a single breath, it was not wise to break the rules within this tomb.

“Alright! Considering your dragon clan blood, I'll let you try. However, my inheritance is not easy to obtain. It's not just about strength; I'm sure you know that!” The old man nodded, then spoke.

“First, let's take this first test! On this mountain, there are ten million herbs. You must memorize them within three days. If you pass, you may proceed to the next test; if not, leave immediately!” The old man spoke to Luo Tian and then vanished from his sight. He didn't even bother to look, as the Dragon Clan had previously sent people skilled in alchemy who failed.

“Ten million!” Luo Tian's eyes widened, gazing at the herbs carved on the mountain wall with awe.

Luo Tian was now a master of alchemy in the Nine Domains, having mastered millions of herbs. He felt somewhat proud; few people could achieve such alchemical skills at his age.

“Any path has no end!” Luo Tian murmured softly, feeling his pride crushed by the terrifying number of ten million.

“Three days to memorize ten million herbs. For anyone, it's impossible, but with my prior knowledge, there must be repetitions. Within three days, I should manage a few million herbs!” Luo Tian's eyes glowed with purple light. Though confident, he dared not waste time. He gazed at the herbs carved on the mountain wall.

“Nameless Leaf, shaped like floating clouds. Its nature is yin, growing on the icy mountain top…”

“Celestial Mirage Silk… shaped like thin silk…” Luo Tian, as before, immersed himself in the ocean of herbs. Each herb he had never heard of appeared in his mind, memorizing both its properties and appearance—this was a habit he had cultivated.

Time flowed slowly. Two days passed, and Luo Tian sighed deeply, his eyes bloodshot from the immense mental strain. Though it was exhausting for him, he felt invigorated. He would seize this opportunity; no alchemist would give it up.

“Again!” Luo Tian took a brief breath, his eyes filled with madness. He gazed again at the herbs on the mountain wall and began to memorize them.

One day was short for any cultivator, but Luo Tian's eyes turned blood red, as if he hadn't slept in many days. His forehead was drenched with sweat, too exhausting for his mental strength. Even with Luo Tian's willpower, it was difficult to endure.

“This disciple must be an alchemist. His dedication to herbs and their properties is not something ordinary people possess!” The old man, dressed in red robes, sat on the mountain peak. His face bore a touch of admiration.

Dragon Roar had some reservations about Luo Tian's identity and did not want him to obtain his inheritance. He gave others ten days, but for Luo Tian, he only gave three.

“If you succeed, I'll let you continue the tests. If not, those herbs you memorized will be your compensation. It's enough to further your alchemical skills!” Dragon Roar murmured softly, though he was just a fragment of his former self, he still held the same thoughts as Dragon Roar.

One day passed. The time set by Dragon Roar had finally arrived, and his spiritual form reappeared above Luo Tian.

“Alright, time's up!” Dragon Roar spoke to Luo Tian and waved his hand. The mountain wall restored itself into a mountain, and the herb characters disappeared.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian did not feel embarrassed. His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed onto the ground, his face pale as a sheet. His bloodshot eyes gradually regained their focus but were still filled with redness.

“Elder, give me some time to recover!” Luo Tian said and immediately sat cross-legged on the ground, as if falling into a deep sleep to recover.

“Never mind!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form sighed deeply and waited for Luo Tian. He had seen Luo Tian's effort, and no one could ignore the sight of him staring at the mountain wall for three days.

“Unfortunately, he's not from our clan. He's much stronger than those previous boys. The longest time any of them had was just one day!” Dragon Roar's eyes held satisfaction as he watched Luo Tian. He was the best one he had seen in years.

After a moment, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. His bloodshot eyes were gone, and he had returned to normal. He gazed at Dragon Roar.

“Alright, you may leave! My inheritance isn't suitable for you. I can teach you something else!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form spoke softly.

“What do you mean, elder?” Luo Tian looked puzzled upon hearing Dragon Roar's words. He had expended so much energy to memorize the ten million herbs on the mountain wall, and now he was being told to leave. How could he accept that?

“Elder, are you saying I memorized ten million herbs and then don't want to give me the inheritance? You really think I'm a soft target?” Luo Tian's face darkened, gazing at Dragon Roar's spiritual form. He was ready to tear down this tomb.

“You're saying you memorized ten million herbs in three days? You're joking!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form looked down on him.

“If I did memorize them, then proceed with the normal process. Originally, I had great respect for Elder Dragon Roar, but seeing you now, I'm disappointed!” Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at Dragon Roar.

“Moreover, I think I know why you failed to create immortal herbs!” Luo Tian sighed softly, his voice filled with strong disappointment.

“What? You know why I failed to create immortal herbs?” Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Dragon Roar's spiritual form trembled violently.

“I'm just guessing. But I feel the problem is huge!” Luo Tian sighed softly, then gazed at Dragon Roar with a cold smile.

“Say it! Why!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form, though just a fragment, held Dragon Roar's thoughts.

“Can I continue the inheritance tests?” Luo Tian looked at Dragon Roar's spiritual form with a playful gaze.

“If you memorized ten million herbs, naturally you can proceed to the next test!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form spoke softly and continued: “Now, say why!”

“Let me finish my inheritance journey first!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke again about the herbs on the mountain wall.

“Hunmeng Magic Root… the main trunk of Hunmeng Spirit Tree, purple…” Luo Tian ignored Dragon Roar's spiritual form and spoke softly, reciting the names and properties of herbs.

“Really memorized them!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form looked in disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian. He could not believe that Luo Tian had truly memorized all the herbs on the mountain wall in just three days.

Time flowed slowly. Luo Tian continued to speak, reciting for five days until he completed the ten million herbs, leaving Dragon Roar's spiritual form with his mouth open.

“Alas… to memorize ten million herbs in three days and understand their properties, your talent with plants has surpassed me. Only my master could be like you!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form sighed deeply, his eyes filled with admiration.

“Next test, you will receive normal treatment!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form spoke softly and gazed at Luo Tian.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian smiled and did not mention his alchemical rank. He dared not trust Dragon Roar; if he revealed his secrets, and Dragon Roar continued to trouble him, he would be at a disadvantage.

“Alright, proceed with the next test!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form spoke softly and then vanished into Luo Tian's sight, the mountain that recorded ten million herbs vanishing from his view.

“No mountain will appear again for five hundred years!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form reappeared in Luo Tian's sight.

Without the mountain blocking, Luo Tian could now see the scene ahead. However, his face suddenly changed, filled with awe.

Before him stretched an endless field of herbs, each plant swaying and radiating rich vitality.

“Such a vast herb field!” Luo Tian could not help but exclaim. It was his first time seeing such a massive herb field.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian marveled, Dragon Roar's spiritual form extended a hand toward him. A series of incantations were imprinted into Luo Tian's mind, but only the upper half was present.

“Hui Chun Quan (Revitalization Scripture)?” Luo Tian exclaimed, frowning slightly and gazing at Dragon Roar's spiritual form.

“Six months to comprehend the upper half of Hui Chun Quan and cultivate three immortal herbs!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form spoke softly, causing Luo Tian's face to shift slightly.

“Revitalizing herbs!” Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a smile, his lips curling slightly. However, cultivating one immortal herb was still challenging for him. As for Hui Chun Quan, he did not intend to use it immediately; comprehending it would take time.

“Six months?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. To successfully cultivate an herb into an immortal one required at least ten thousand years, and even then, success was uncertain. Alchemists could accelerate the process with their techniques.

“Truly变态 (abnormal) test!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, then did not delay. He soared into the endless herb field.

Luo Tian flew through the herb field, searching for herbs that could be cultivated within six months using the Wanyi Shengsheng Quan (All-Encompassing Life-Bestowing Scripture). Naturally, he used the Wanyi Shengsheng Quan, which he was highly skilled in.

“Found it!” He then arrived at a marsh and saw a herb resembling a lotus, his face breaking into a smile.

Xuan Shuang Lian (Cold Frost Lotus), growing in marshy areas. Its nature was cold, and when it matured into an immortal herb, it would produce nine lotus seeds. The seeds could be used in medicine and radiated coldness, freezing the surrounding ten miles of marsh.

“This Cold Frost Lotus will surely become an immortal herb if given enough time!” Luo Tian murmured, standing in midair above the Cold Frost Lotus. He moved his hands, and nine immortal bodies of reincarnation emitted white light, forming pure white runes that flew from his hands.

“Buzz…” The Wanyi Shengsheng Quan flowed through the white runes, wrapping around the Cold Frost Lotus. The lotus slowly swayed, emitting waves of desire.

“He learned Hui Chun Quan so quickly!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form looked surprised at Luo Tian's rapid cultivation.

“Not possible. No one could learn Hui Chun Quan so quickly!”

“There's only one possibility: he already knows the method of cultivation, and his level is not much lower than Hui Chun Quan!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form murmured, though it was a ghostly image, his eyes held a touch of anticipation.

“Perhaps my inheritance will truly be obtained by him!” Dragon Roar's face bore a complex expression, then sighed deeply.

However, Luo Tian ignored Dragon Roar's spiritual form's amazement. His Epoch power was continuously driven by the Wanyi Shengsheng Quan, flowing into the Cold Frost Lotus.

Time flowed slowly. Seven days passed. Luo Tian's immortal bodies of reincarnation in his dantian became translucent, as if they could be exhausted at any moment.

“Buzz…” Under Luo Tian's continuous cultivation, the Cold Frost Lotus grew, a white petal radiating coldness that froze the surrounding marsh. The lotus gradually withered, producing a crystalline seed.

“He completed the first cultivation so quickly!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form looked surprised, gazing at Luo Tian who had sat down to recover.

“Too long a time. Seven days to cultivate one seed. Nine seeds would require at least sixty-three days, and I need a day to recover. That means cultivating this Cold Frost Lotus into an immortal herb would take nearly seventy days!” The Reincarnation Heaven Technique was activated, and a dense vortex of qi spun above Luo Tian's head. The terrifying qi poured into his body.

“Good, the qi here is extremely rich, allowing me to recover quickly. However, I need to find a way to shorten the time!” Luo Tian recovered while thinking about how to speed up.

Luo Tian's thoughts were continuous, and his immortal bodies of reincarnation solidified at a terrifying speed.

“While I have this time, let me try to comprehend Hui Chun Quan!” However, after thinking for a while, he could not find a way. He had to rely on Hui Chun Quan.

“Spring... all things revive, one inhale and it's absorbed. Qi merges into one, one inhalation and it's swallowed. All things revive…” Luo Tian murmured Hui Chun Quan in his mind, continuously comprehending it.

“Truly a prodigy!” Dragon Roar was no ordinary person. He had been an honorary disciple of the Epoch Lord, and even if Meng Yixian hadn't yet become the Epoch Lord at that time, the Epoch Lords were all outstanding. Seeing Luo Tian's霸道 (brutal) technique, he could clearly see that Luo Tian was no ordinary person.

One day passed. Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, sighing deeply. He practiced the Reincarnation Heaven Technique while comprehending Hui Chun Quan, but his comprehension slowed due to multitasking. It was the most forbidden thing in cultivation.

“Never mind, proceed with the plan!” Luo Tian murmured softly and then returned to the tedious cultivation.

“One... two…” Time flowed slowly. Under Luo Tian's continuous cultivation, crystalline seeds of the Cold Frost Lotus continuously formed on it.

“Fifth!” After more than a month, Luo Tian gazed at the five seeds formed and sat down again.

However, after sitting for half a day, his lips slightly curled. His entire body radiated warmth, and a gust of wind blew around him, carrying a warm feeling like spring breeze, swaying his robes.

“This is Hui Chun Quan!” Dragon Roar's spiritual form, observing Luo Tian, looked in disbelief and exclaimed.

“How is it possible? How could he comprehend Hui Chun Quan while recovering! Such a terrifying level of comprehension, even his master hadn't achieved it!” Dragon Roar's heart was in turmoil, looking at Luo Tian as if he were a monster.
