“What is the Tianyuan Continent, and why did Ke Zhen Tian immediately issue an attack order when the people of the Tianyuan Sect mentioned it?” The onlookers murmured among themselves, their brows furrowed in confusion.

“Idiot!” Sha Cang Mang stood beneath the void, cursing Ke Zhen Tian’s foolishness in his mind. This act of concealment only heightened people's curiosity, failing to suppress it and instead fueling it. Having lived so long, Sha Cang Mang knew well the terror of curiosity.

As people’s inquisitiveness deepened, the two factions finally converged, like two torrents of water colliding and devouring each other.

In an instant, countless limbs scattered beneath the endless starry void, blood dripping endlessly to form a river drifting through the cosmos.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing, after a brief moment, transformed into bloodied figures. With each strike, they felled countless disciples of the Baihu and Zhuque Sects, as if stomping on swarms of ants.

“I will crush you with numbers!” Ke Zhen Tian and Jin Yong Si stood at the rear of their sects, faces twisted with ferocity.

The two sects were allies; Jin Yong Si had nearly lost his life to Luo Tian before. Ke Zhen Tian knew this well, and the two were evenly matched. Seeing Jin Yong Si’s plight, Ke Zhen Tian dared not face Luo Tian alone, especially with Nan Gong Yu Qing, who was nearly his equal. Thus, they resorted to a human wave tactic to overwhelm Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing.

Without Jin Yong Si and Ke Zhen Tian, Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing moved as if through a desert of the dead. Each attack claimed countless lives from the two sects.

Soon, blood mist enveloped Luo Tian’s form, and he felt numb from the killing. He no longer knew how many people he had slain but continued to channel his original power, striking with relentless force.

The disciples of the Zhuque and Baihu Sects suffered heavy losses, while the prisoners from Hulao Star advanced like gods of death. Having emerged from blood-soaked mountains, they were at home in this battlefield, charging into the two sects with ferocity, slaughtering relentlessly.

The numbers of the two sects dwindled rapidly, causing Jin Yong Si and Ke Zhen Tian unbearable pain. Within moments, nearly a million disciples of the two sects perished under Luo Tian’s onslaught.

Though the Tianyuan Sect also suffered casualties, only ten thousand had died—ten times fewer than the two sects.

“This Tianyuan Sect is truly powerful, driving the two sects into such a state!”

“Why have so many died? Why haven’t Jin Zhenjiao and Ke Zhen Tian intervened? Are they waiting for Luo Tian and these outlaws to massacre all the disciples?” The crowd murmured, their confusion deepening.

“Jiuyuan,” Xuanwu Elder Tortoise opened his hazy eyes, sighing. “Luo Tian has ascended to Jiuyuan. With his talent, even if he doesn’t crush Jin Yong Si, it’s near enough! No wonder they dared not act!”

“Alas, this bloody clash… how many lives will be lost? Why must it happen? Let the guilty go free when possible!” Chen Xuanning’s face bore sorrow, gazing at the falling combatants.

“Damn it…” Hearing Chen Xuanning’s words, the onlookers shunned him like a plague, their faces pale with fear.

Even Sha Cang Mang’s lips twitched as he subtly retreated from Chen Xuanning, their inner thoughts cursing: “Brother, please don’t say that again. Every time you do, someone dies. Who knows who’ll be next?”

Chen Xuanning’s face bore confusion as he watched the crowd vanish from his vicinity. Even Xuanwu Elder Tortoise wore a grim expression, slapping Chen Xuanning’s head: “If you say ‘let the guilty go free when possible’ again, I’ll kill you!”

“What’s wrong with me? What does it have to do with me?” Chen Xuanning looked puzzled, unaware why Xuanwu Elder Tortoise spoke thus.

Yet, as Xuanwu was his sect’s foundation, Chen Xuanning dared not offend him. He nodded, continuing to watch the warring factions with a sorrowful expression.

Within moments, the Zhuque and Baihu Sects suffered further losses, their lives rendered worthless before the battle.

“One million… two million…” Time passed slowly; after an hour of combat, the two sects had lost three million.

Corpses piled like mountains, the scene reaching an unparalleled level of awe. Yet the slaughter continued, the starry void cracking open as swirling gray mist emerged, black whirlpools forming beneath the ruptured space, sucking in corpses with immense suction.

The Tianyuan Sect also suffered heavy losses; within an hour, nearly a million had fallen.

At this point, both factions were exhausted, their eyes bloodshot, original power depleted.

Seeing this, Ke Zhen Tian, perhaps unwilling to witness further losses, or sensing Luo Tian’s original power waning, raised his voice: “Luo Tian! Dare you face me in single combat?”

Chapter 831: What Fear Is There?

Ke Zhen Tian transformed into a dragon, his face etched with endless coldness. He brandished his sword and roared at Luo Tian, still clashing within the throng: “Luo Tian! Dare you face me in single combat?”

Ke Zhen Tian’s voice echoed across the battlefield, bringing a flicker of hope to the Zhuque Sect disciples.

Though battle raged, they had felt its brutality deeply. Watching comrades fall in droves before their eyes, the Zhuque and Baihu Sect disciples trembled, fearing Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing’s original power would next strike them.

Now that Ke Zhen Tian had challenged, it was likely Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing would face Ke Zhen Tian and Jin Yong Si, easing their burden significantly.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing walked through the crowd with a smile, gazing at Ke Zhen Tian’s imposing figure above.

“Finally, you couldn’t hold back?” Luo Tian ascended into the sky, and no Zhuque disciple dared intercept him, sighing in relief as they saw Luo Tian wielding the Rupture Spear.

“Fight! What fear is there?” Luo Tian’s voice carried coldness; without hesitation, he thrust his spear toward Ke Zhen Tian.

“Boring! Jin Yong Si, come play with me!” Nan Gong Yu Qing also ascended into the sky, his eyes burning with battlelust as he gazed at Jin Yong Si behind the two sects.

“Do you think me a soft target?” Jin Yong Si spoke loudly, his heart drumming. Yet, with the challenge issued, if he refused, Jin Yong Si would never again hold his head high in the Four Sacred Star Domains.

He gritted his teeth, face twisted with ferocity, and summoned the Baihu Shattered Gold Spear. He stood before Nan Gong Yu Qing.

“Nan Gong Yu Qing, must you meddle in this mess?” Jin Yong Si hissed. If not for Nan Gong Yu Qing’s presence, the Tianyuan Sect would never have been so powerful.

“Can’t help it; I lost a bet. Luo Tian is now my boss. One must keep promises, right?” Nan Gong Yu Qing lightly caressed his bloodstained sword, addressing Jin Yong Si.

“Good! Today I’ll make you regret it!” Jin Yong Si’s face twisted with ferocity, recalling his secret weapon. A flicker of confidence returned to him as he charged toward Nan Gong Yu Qing.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian and Ke Zhen Tian clashed, their every collision sending tremors through the air.

Each clash left Ke Zhen Tian more battered, his body marked with cracks, eyes wide with disbelief.

In just a few brief exchanges, they had clashed over twenty times. Ke Zhen Tian knew Luo Tian was strong but hadn’t expected him to be this formidable.

Sacrificing so many lives to drain Luo Tian’s original power, yet he still couldn’t match him. This revelation stunned Ke Zhen Tian.

Not only Ke Zhen Tian, but even Sha Cang Mang’s face paled as he gazed at the mighty youth in the sky, his eyes filled with shock.

“Ke Zhen Tian isn’t even Luo Tian’s match!”

“Could the rumors be true? That Luo Tian burned eight original powers of Jin Yong Si?” The crowd murmured, their voices filled with awe.

Initially, they hadn’t believed the rumors, but now, seeing Luo Tian reduce Ke Zhen Tian to such a state in so short a time, they began to doubt their disbelief.

“Too strong! I feel now I’m no match for this kid!” Sha Cang Mang inwardly shuddered. For years, he had dominated as the top warrior of the Four Sacred Star Domains. Now, seeing Luo Tian’s might, he felt a mix of bitterness and rising unease.

Ke Zhen Tian was powerful, but so was Sha Cang Mang. If the rumors were true, he knew now he wasn’t Luo Tian’s match.

“Can’t allow this kid to grow stronger; the Four Sacred Star Domains will have no place for our Qinglong Sect!” Sha Cang Mang’s eyes flashed with determination, as if contemplating something, his silence deep.

“Such a kid has already become an dragon; no one in the Four Sacred Star Domains can match him!” Xuanwu Elder Tortoise spoke softly, his words sending shockwaves through the crowd.

The people trusted Xuanwu Elder Tortoise’s words, and now their gazes toward Luo Tian had changed.

Meanwhile, Jin Yong Si and Nan Gong Yu Qing clashed repeatedly. Jin Yong Si’s condition mirrored Ke Zhen Tian’s, his body riddled with bloodstains and holes from the crimson sword.

“Crack…” In the black night, emerald lightning flashed. Luo Tian bathed in thunder, his three fists striking Ke Zhen Tian with merciless force.

Ke Zhen Tian’s face paled, his body emitting cracks as he collided with stars, eyes filled with terror.

Strong—Luo Tian was too strong now, surpassing even his eight-source level by an immeasurable margin. He had no choice but to endure the blows.

Original power surged, mending Ke Zhen Tian’s fractured bones while he sneered: “You think I came unprepared?”

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow but remained fearless. He knew Ke Zhen Tian wasn’t so easily defeated. Though he had been on the defensive, the Zhuque and Baihu Sects were major powers with long traditions. Jin Yong Si’s lack of preparation had cost him dearly before, and now, he wouldn’t be so foolish as to let Luo Tian trample them again.

“Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum!” Ke Zhen Tian roared, his hand sweeping. Crimson flames erupted from his sleeve into the void, and a massive red drum materialized before the crowd. A pressure that shook heaven enveloped the battlefield, halting it abruptly.

“Sacred Artifact! Ke Zhen Tian has truly been cornered!” Chen Xuanning’s face showed shock, his gaze on the red drum engulfed in flames.

Sacred Artifacts—anything bearing the “sacred” title was no ordinary item. Sensing the pressure from the red drum, Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly.

“Die, kid!” Ke Zhen Tian sneered, his hand sweeping as original power coalesced into a multicolored drumstick. He struck the red Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum with all his might.

“Boom!” In an instant, nine original powers coalesced into the drumstick and collided with the red drum, producing a thunderous roar.

Fire surged, lightning crackled; the black starry void darkened as nine original powers exploded upon contact with the drum, embedding themselves into its skin.

Luo Tian’s heart clenched at the sight of the drumstick descending. But before he could react, it struck the drum’s skin, original power transforming into runes that surged toward Luo Tian.

A single strike shattered stars; even the nearby Dongping Continent trembled, and Xuanwu Elder Tortoise’s array activated to block the Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum’s attack.

The sound of Dao filled the air; Luo Tian felt as if struck by lightning, blood gushing from his orifices. He swayed in the void, dazed and disoriented, eyes wide with shock.

“Kid, good! You’ve endured the Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum—truly formidable. But can you withstand the second strike?” Ke Zhen Tian’s face bore triumph as he gathered nine original powers again.

Meanwhile, Jin Yong Si, pressured by Nan Gong Yu Qing, also unleashed his secret weapon. His battered form rose as an ancient copper mirror materialized in his hands.

“Another Sacred Artifact!” The crowd gazed at the seemingly ordinary mirror, exclaiming in awe. They marveled at the four major sects’ profound heritage.

“Only these four sects, with their long traditions, could find Sacred Artifacts in the Four Sacred Star Domains!” The crowd murmured, their faces filled with envy.

Sacred Artifacts—named for their origin from saintly power, they were weapons forged by saints. Each saint could only craft one Sacred Artifact in their lifetime.

Though the crowd didn’t know how Jin Yong Si and Ke Zhen Tian obtained their weapons, their power was undeniable.

“Buddha’s Realm! Let this monster be refined!” Jin Yong Si poured nine original powers into the ordinary mirror.

As Jin Yong Si’s original power entered, the unassuming mirror trembled, radiating light. A blinding sun-like glow illuminated the void, lighting up the endless darkness.

A series of light screens emerged from the mirror, rushing toward Nan Gong Yu Qing with destructive might and powerful refining forces. Each screen carried apocalyptic power, slicing through the void.

Nan Gong Yu Qing moved swiftly, knowing he couldn’t withstand a Sacred Artifact head-on. He dodged each screen with precision.

Though his speed was fast, he still caught a screen slicing across his waist. The refining force of the screen pierced into his body, nearly cleaving him in two.

“Haha! You two are doomed!” Ke Zhen Tian and Jin Yong Si laughed maniacally, watching their attack wound Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing. Their joy was palpable.

Chapter 832: Blood Sea Overflowing

Beneath the starry void, Ke Zhen Tian and Jin Yong Si laughed maniacally, each wielding a drum and mirror to crush Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing.

“Can’t withstand it! Sacred Artifacts are too powerful—this is beyond our current strength!” Luo Tian calculated inwardly, watching Ke Zhen Tian’s original power coalescing into a drumstick. His heart trembled.

Meanwhile, Nan Gong Yu Qing’s form was even more battered, dodging screen after screen while his eyes burned with hatred.

“Enter the Demon Realm!” Without hesitation, both Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing unleashed dark qi from their bodies, flooding into them. Their formidable presence radiated through the void.

“Demon Qi Infusion—Half Step Beyond the Ordinary!” Luo Tian’s face bore a smile, his gaze turning icy.

“What is this technique?” Sha Cang Mang and others were stunned, their voices filled with awe at the overwhelming power radiating from Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing’s bodies were shrouded in gray qi, resembling two devils. Their bodies emitted thunderous roars that shook the starry void.

At the same time, Ke Zhen Tian’s drumbeats surged toward Luo Tian. The sound of Dao crashed like waves against him.

Luo Tian wiped the blood from his lips, his voice cold: “Old dog! Today is your Zhuque Sect’s day of extinction!”

Luo Tian, shrouded in gray qi,闪动 through the void. He charged toward Ke Zhen Tian without fear of the Sacred Artifact’s power.

“Die! Can you even withstand a Sacred Artifact?” Ke Zhen Tian sneered, watching Luo Tian charge directly at him.

“Sacred Artifacts are indeed powerful, but can you, a Nine-Source Supreme, unleash even a fraction of their power?” Luo Tian’s voice was cold as he plunged into the waves of sound.

Original power surged, colliding with Luo Tian’s body, slowing him slightly. His robes flapped violently.

“Break it!” Luo Tian thrust his spear forward, a ship-like force slicing through the sound waves toward Ke Zhen Tian.

Half Step Beyond the Ordinary Luo Tian was formidable; though his speed was hindered by the sound waves, he wasn’t Ke Zhen Tian’s match. He transformed into a black lightning bolt, slicing through the void to appear before Ke Zhen Tian’s Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum. His spear struck.

The dark, cold tip of the spear carried an aura that tore through everything, piercing Ke Zhen Tian’s chest.

Ke Zhen Tian was no slouch; a Nine-Source Supreme who had dominated the Four Sacred Star Domains for years. He felt a chill in his chest and knew he was in trouble. He retreated, summoning nine-colored realms to shield himself.

“Crack!” But Ke Zhen Tian’s realm was as fragile as paper, pierced instantly by Luo Tian’s spear. The spear plunged into Ke Zhen Tian’s heart.

Nine original powers burned; Ke Zhen Tian fought desperately, burning all nine to increase his speed by threefold. He was just a hair’s breadth away from piercing Ke Zhen Tian’s heart.

“Cough! Cough!” Though Ke Zhen Tian wasn’t killed by Luo Tian’s spear, he was severely wounded and retreated a thousand feet.

Before Ke Zhen Tian could recover, a black magic sword slashed down, cleaving him in two. Blood mist scattered across the endless void.

Three souls appeared before the crowd—Ke Zhen Tian’s three solid souls, their eyes filled with panic.

Ke Zhen Tian was terrified; his physical body had been shattered by Luo Tian, leaving only three souls. He no longer had the strength to fight. The three souls scattered in different directions.

Luo Tian stood in the void, his long hair flowing, his body radiating dark qi. His gaze held disdain as he waved his hand, trapping Ke Zhen Tian’s three souls in endless dark qi and consuming them.

“Dead… dead…” The crowd’s faces showed fear as they gazed at Luo Tian, whose dark qi filled the void. Their eyes held disbelief—how could Ke Zhen Tian, who had dominated the Four Sacred Star Domains for years, be killed by Luo Tian?

Meanwhile, Nan Gong Yu Qing was also shrouded in dark qi, his magic sword in hand. He clashed with the light screens from Jin Yong Si’s mirror, their battle evenly matched. Yet it wasn’t because Nan Gong Yu Qing was weaker; he bore a smile, clashing with the screens while his eyes held contemplation.

Luo Tian knew Nan Gong Yu Qing could kill Jin Yong Si at will, but he didn’t know what Nan Gong Yu Qing intended. He ignored it and turned his gaze to the Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum, a Sacred Artifact.

He ascended onto the drum’s surface, feeling an ancient aura wash over his soul, marveling at the drum’s power.

“Treasures are buried—wonder how much of this Sacred Artifact I could unlock when I reach the Beyond Ordinary realm!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, storing the Ten Directions Xuanfei Drum in his storage ring.

Meanwhile, the three sects’ battle raged on. Though the Tianyuan Sect had fewer numbers, their Hulao Star prisoners acted like a sharp blade, slicing through the two sects’ ranks. They slaughtered countless disciples, making the battle evenly matched.

Though the two sects had more numbers, they struggled to hold on. Blood filled the sky, and a thick scent of blood permeated the air.

“Haha! I’ll see who has the guts to impersonate us, the Heavenly River Four Bandits!” A cold voice echoed from the void. A ancient warship slowly approached the battlefield, its power causing Luo Tian to start slightly.

“Heavenly River Four Bandits!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his expression grave. He had met the Heavenly River Four Bandits before and knew their strength rivaled that of Hulao Star. Now, their appearance meant they were after him and his group, causing Luo Tian to startle.

The ancient warship seemed slow but moved with no delay. In an instant, it appeared a thousand feet away from the battlefield.

Li Yangzhi and his companions stood at the ship’s front, their brows furrowed. They felt the battle’s brutality, even seasoned killers like them were momentarily stunned.

The battlefield was horrifying—corpses scattered everywhere, blood mist filling the air.

“Which side is the Tianyuan Sect? They dare to impersonate us, today will be their day of extinction!” Ren Hongzhe, the second brother beside Lin Yangzhi, spoke with a playful smirk.

Hearing Ren Hongzhe’s roar, Jin Yong Si, who was still wielding the mirror, smiled. He knew the Heavenly River Four Bandits’ terror; if they joined their side, there was a chance of victory.

Now that Ke Zhen Tian was dead and he stood alone, if the Heavenly River Four Bandits aided him, they could use their numbers to surround and destroy Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yu Qing.

“The Heavenly River Four Bandits! Those in blue robes are the Tianyuan Sect!” Jin Yong Si quickly informed Lin Yangzhi.

Hearing Jin Yong Si’s call, Lin Yangzhi and his companions gazed at the battlefield. They saw the Hulao Star prisoners, like a bent knife slicing through both sects’ ranks. Their expressions turned grave.

“Hmph, strange… why do I feel their techniques resemble ours?” Ren Hongzhe’s face showed confusion.

“Ah, who cares? Who dares to impersonate us won’t live! Brother Two, let’s fight!” Lu Xingzu’s face lit up with excitement as he addressed Lin Yangzhi.

The Heavenly River Four Bandits’ faces trembled; such a battlefield thrilled them, their blood boiling for battle. Yet when Ren Hongzhe and Lu Xingzu looked to Lin Yangzhi with eager eyes, they found him gazing at the flickering light screens on Nan Gong Yu Qing.

“Lin Xiong, we’ve met again!” Luo Tian’s face bore caution as he stood before the ancient warship. His voice carried a careful tone.

“Luo Tian?” Lin Yangzhi’s heart stirred at the sound of Luo Tian’s voice. Seeing the dark qi shrouding Luo Tian, he inhaled sharply.

“Lin Xiong, our Tianyuan Sect never impersonated you. We ask for your help based on our past connection and hope you won’t interfere with this matter!” Luo Tian held his spear, his body radiating pressure.

“Big Brother! Why are you here?” Lin Yangzhi seemed to ignore Luo Tian’s words, shouting at Nan Gong Yu Qing who wielded his magic sword in the sky.

“Huh…” The crowd’s faces showed disbelief, staring at Lin Yangzhi and his companions on the warship. They hadn’t expected this outcome.

Jin Yong Si’s lips twitched; he hadn’t anticipated this result. He had hoped the Heavenly River Four Bandits would be his salvation, but Lin Yangzhi’s “Big Brother” had crushed his hopes.

Even Luo Tian was stunned—Nan Gong Yu Qing was the legendary leader of the Heavenly River Four Bandits. He was momentarily speechless.

“Enough! Luo Tian is now my Big Brother and can represent me fully. You may heed his words!” Nan Gong Yu Qing slashed a screen, addressing Lin Yangzhi before ignoring him.

Chapter 833: The Saint’s Finger

Beneath the starry void, blood sea overflowed; battle raged on. Luo Tian stood before the ancient warship, gazing at Lin Yangzhi and his companions. Below was an endless sea of blood.

Lin Yangzhi, Ren Hongzhe, and Lu Xingzu locked eyes with Luo Tian. Their brows furrowed tightly.

After a brief stare, Lin Yangzhi nodded slightly and waved to the people behind him on the ship: “Kill!”

“Kill!” A cold, ruthless atmosphere formed on the ship. The people aboard roared in unison, and the ship suddenly accelerated toward the battlefield with terrifying pressure. It pierced through the heavens, emitting a deep hum as it reached the battlefield in an instant.

The massive ship collided with the Baihu and Zhuque Sects’ disciples, scattering flesh and causing countless deaths.

“An execution machine! This is the real execution machine!” Luo Tian stood beneath the stars, gazing at those crushed by the ship with admiration.

The Hulao Star prisoners’ strength had already stunned them; now, witnessing the Heavenly River Four Bandits’ ship crushing their foes with such power was even more震撼.

“Damn it, when will we have a ship this cool?” The Hulao Star prisoners gazed with envy. They felt the people on the ship weren’t much stronger than them, but this ship was terrifying, amplifying their strength to its peak.

In one strike, the Baihu and Zhuque Sects’ disciples suffered heavy losses—over forty thousand dead in this single impact.

“Kill!” After the strike, black-clad people leaped from the ship, forming a dark torrent that surged toward the two sects.

“Brothers! Don’t let them outshine us; don’t disgrace ourselves!” Tu Hongfei roared, his eyes burning with fierce battle spirit. His words weren’t directed at the Baihu and Zhuque Sects but at the Heavenly River Four Bandits’ tens of thousands.

“Roar…” A low growl echoed from the Hulao Star prisoners, their bodies like rutting bulls charging at the two sects.

In contrast, the Baihu and Zhuque Sects were pitiful—like antelope facing a lion pride. They offered only token resistance before being torn apart by the two forces.

Jiang Sixi led the Tianyuan Sect’s people out of the battlefield, his face filled with admiration as he gazed at the two groups clashing within the Baihu and Zhuque Sects.

“With these two groups, we don’t need to lift a finger!” Jiang Yimeng, now a bloodied figure, stood behind Jiang Sixi.

“What the hell are they?!” The Tianyuan Sect disciples, having escaped the battlefield, gazed at the Hulao Star prisoners and Heavenly River Four Bandits who slaughtered like butchers.

“Done! The Zhuque Sect and Baihu Sect are done! The Four Sacred Star Domains have turned upside down!” The onlookers, watching the two sects’ numbers dwindle, sighed silently.

“Those are the Zhuque and Baihu Sects! They dominated the Four Sacred Star Domains for years, yet now they’ve been destroyed by a single boy!” Someone shouted, and the crowd fell silent.

“Sha Xiong, we’ve reached this point. Should we preserve a spark of the two sects?” Chen Xuanning’s face bore sorrow as he turned to Sha Cang Mang.

But before he could finish, he noticed Sha Cang Mang was gone—when had he and the Qinglong Sect retreated from the battlefield?

“He left! And we should too!” Xuanwu Elder Tortoise opened his eyes, his gaze flashing with intensity as he addressed Chen Xuanning.

“Why? The battle isn’t over yet!” Chen Xuanning’s face bore confusion, but he was immediately transformed into his original form and swallowed by Xuanwu Elder Tortoise, vanishing into the starry void.

Jin Yong Si’s face twisted with ferocity; he wanted to burn his original power and fight Luo Tian, but he lacked the courage. He knew from when Luo Tian killed Ke Zhen Tian that there was no escape—only a desperate fight.

The Heavenly River Four Bandits’ arrival had once given Jin Yong Si hope, but it instead accelerated the two sects’ downfall.

“What to do?” Jin Yong Si’s heart raced, watching Nan Gong Yu Qing grow more at ease under the mirror’s light screens. He knew Nan Gong Yu Qing could escape but chose not to.

“Jin Yong Si, today I’ll see where you run!” Luo Tian appeared before Jin Yong Si, his body shrouded in dark qi, eyes wild with arrogance.

Since arriving at the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian had been cautious, yet he’d nearly lost his life several times—each time due to the Baihu Sect. If not for his luck, he wouldn’t have survived their attacks.

Now, all the resentment in his heart was released; with his strength vastly surpassing both sects’ combined might, he felt elation.

“Luo Tian, do you think this is enough to defeat me? Today I’ll die with you as my companion!” Jin Yong Si’s face twisted with madness, shouting at Luo Tian. He extended his hand, channeling all his original power into the mirror.

“Wum…” As Jin Yong Si’s original power flowed into the mirror, it emitted a deep hum. Golden light surged skyward, and a massive finger’s shadow emerged from the mirror, materializing into reality.

Pressure—immense pressure descended upon everyone. Even Xuanwu Elder Tortoise, who had just escaped, paused.

Some界尊境 (Realm-Transcendent) disciples were crushed by this pressure, turning into blood mist.

This attack was indiscriminate; even the Zhuque and Baihu Sects were targeted, explosions echoing through the void.

“What is this!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed in grave concern as he gazed at the massive finger.

Too powerful—though it was just a single finger, it filled Luo Tian with immense pressure, causing him to tremble.

“Luo Tian, how will you block it? You know what a saint is, right? This is the finger of a saint from the divine race. Can you withstand it? Even one strike would be enough to kill you!” Jin Yong Si’s face was pale, his eyes wild. He had no choice but to unleash the mirror after failing to burn his original power.

“Block it! I must block it!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with madness as he gazed at the golden light.

“Why couldn’t I subdue this mirror? It’s because it contains a saint’s strike!” Nan Gong Yu Qing’s face showed understanding. His dark qi surged, and he leaped from the light screens, appearing before Luo Tian. The pressure was divided, easing Luo Tian’s burden.

“Can you block it?” Luo Tian smiled at Nan Gong Yu Qing.

“Approximately! Let’s try!” Nan Gong Yu Qing’s face showed casual confidence, his magic sword in hand.

“Good! I don’t believe two of us can’t withstand a saint’s strike!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with battle spirit, his magic sword in hand.

“Who is this finger? Why is it so terrifying!” The crowd gasped, watching the golden finger emerge from the mirror.

“How could there be such a terrifying person? Fortunately, this pressure is directed at Luo Tian and that young man. If it targeted us, I’d be crushed to dust in an instant!” Someone gasped.

“Unexpectedly, saints are so terrifying they can cross domains and attack through Sacred Artifacts!” Luo Tian muttered, slicing his first blade.
