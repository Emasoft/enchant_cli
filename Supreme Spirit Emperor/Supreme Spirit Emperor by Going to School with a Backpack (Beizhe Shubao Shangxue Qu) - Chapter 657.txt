“Transmute it!” Luo Tian chuckled lightly, waiting for Zhou Yuanhao to complete the transmutation of the medicinal liquid. Though diluted a hundredfold, it still caused Zhou Yuanhao unbearable agony, and after a full day of transmutation, he finally emerged from the cauldron with renewed vigor.

“Master, what is this medicinal liquid? It's so miraculous!” Zhou Yuanhao gazed at Luo Tian with awe, his eyes wide as he watched the latter standing there with a smile.

“This is none of your concern! Your cultivation method is inferior; tomorrow, I shall grant you a better one!” Luo Tian spoke. Having made his decision, he was no longer stingy—his cultivation methods were still plentiful.

“Zhou Xiong, are you telling the truth?” Just as Luo Tian's words had barely finished, a group of figures suddenly appeared outside his courtyard.

Several figures, their faces alight with joy, one a half-Immortal King and several True Immortals at their peak, surrounded Luo Tian's courtyard. An hour prior, the elders and disciples of the outer sect had received news: any True Immortal disciple who could defeat Zhou Yuanhao would be awarded a sixth-grade elixir. Naturally, if they failed, they'd have to pay an equivalent price, and each day only one hour was allowed.

A sixth-grade elixir held immense temptation for a half-Immortal King and True Immortals at their peak. Instantly, it caused a stir within the outer sect, with many elders and disciples rushing over.

“Are you saying this is true? That it's about a duel with my disciple?” Luo Tian extended his hand, and a jade vial materialized in it, containing several sixth-grade elixirs.

“Zhou Xiong, hand over the sixth-grade elixir; I won't kill you!” Seeing Luo Tian actually produce the elixir, a wave of greed surged through them.

Several True Immortals at their peak, faces twisted with greed, stepped into Zhou Xiong's courtyard and surrounded Luo Tian, their gazes filled with menace.

“Fellow disciples, is this not improper?” Luo Tian smiled faintly. These people didn't know that the one before them was no longer Zhou Xiong, the malleable soft plum they once manipulated. Instead, it was a world-shaking killer when unleashed.

“What's improper? Hand it over quickly, or we'll gang up on you!” A True Immortal at their peak sneered.

“Not giving it to you!” Luo Tian feigned heavy breathing, his eyes wild as he gazed at the True Immortals.

Luo Tian's madness caused the True Immortals to hesitate slightly. If it had been the past, Zhou Xiong would have obediently handed over the elixir. Now, he was resisting—this made them uneasy. If Zhou Xiong truly fought to the death, they wouldn't fare well either; after all, Zhou Xiong was a half-Immortal King.

The situation grew awkward. The True Immortals dared not strike, but if they backed down, it would be ridiculed. Who would dare move against Zhou Xiong?

“If you truly desire the elixir, let your disciples fight my disciple. If they win, the elixir is yours!” Luo Tian addressed them, causing a brief pause. Their eyes gleamed.

“Good!” The True Immortals nodded quickly.

“Come on, boy. Take them all down!” Luo Tian addressed the dazed Zhou Yuanhao.

The crowd dispersed, leaving space for the duel. Zhou Yuanhao stood there in bewilderment, never expecting his master to change so drastically.

“I'll do it!” As Zhou Yuanhao was still confused, a figure stepped forward, his expression disdainful. It was one of the young men who had previously come to Zhou Xiong's courtyard, seeking to seize it.

“Chen Tianxiu!” Zhou Yuanhao recognized the youth. He recalled two days ago, when this man had led a group to trouble him and humiliate him.

“Tianxiu, if you win the sixth-grade elixir, I'll greatly reward you and apply for inner sect status!” A True Immortal at their peak spoke, his voice filled with excitement.

“Begin! One hour!” Luo Tian addressed Zhou Yuanhao. As his words finished, Chen Tianxiu leapt forward, fists green with overwhelming energy, charging toward Zhou Yuanhao.

By the time Zhou Yuanhao reacted, Chen Tianxiu was already before him, his face twisted with ferocity.

Zhou Yuanhao swung his fist instinctively toward Chen Tianxiu. The two fists collided, and a thunderous sound echoed between them.

A crackling sound followed as one figure was sent flying, causing people to gasp in shock and fear.

“Boom…” Chen Tianxiu's body fell heavily onto the ground, spitting blood. His eyes held disbelief as he gazed at Zhou Yuanhao standing far away.

“True Immortal Intermediate!” Everyone was speechless. Zhou Xiong's nickname was “Zhou Sǒng,” and now Zhou Yuanhao had inherited this trait perfectly. If it hadn't been for Chen Tianxiu's desire to seize Zhou Xiong's courtyard, Zhou Yuanhao wouldn't have fought back.

“I'm so strong!” Zhou Yuanhao's eyes were wide with shock. He hadn't expected his single punch to knock down Chen Tianxiu.

True Immortals, if no mishaps occur, a slight step up in rank means those of lower cultivation inevitably lose.

“You…” Chen Tianxiu stood up, his gaze fierce with resentment. He hadn't expected to be defeated by Zhou Yuanhao's punch and rushed forward again, but Zhou Yuanhao knocked him back with another punch.

“Combat experience is practically zero!” Luo Tian observed Zhou Yuanhao, who was clumsily swinging his fists. If he faced a True Immortal Intermediate, he'd definitely suffer.

“Boom…” Chen Tianxiu fell again, slowly rising to his feet.

“Again!” Chen Tianxiu shouted, eager for another duel. However, a single hand smacked him down.

“Chen Tianxiu, sit down and rest. Don't block my way!” A youth stepped forward, his gaze toward Zhou Yuanhao with a faint smile.

“Li Xianzhao!” The crowd gasped as they recognized the youth.

Li Xianzhao, one of the top ten geniuses in the outer sect. With True Immortal Intermediate strength, he ranked tenth. Those ahead of him were all True Immortals at their peak.

Li Xianzhao's master was a renowned half-Immortal King elder of the outer sect, Zhong Tian. He had already reached inner sect strength but was waiting for Li Xianzhao to reach True Immortal Peak, then both would enter the inner sect together.

“Finally, someone decent!” Luo Tian's eyes brightened slightly as he gazed at Li Xianzhao.

“Will you kneel yourself, or shall I knock you down?” Li Xianzhao spoke, his voice laced with arrogance. He gazed at Zhou Yuanhao.

Zhou Yuanhao trembled, his gaze on Li Xianzhao. After all, Li Xianzhao's reputation was renowned within the outer sect—even inner sect disciples had heard of him.

“I won't kneel!” Zhou Yuanhao spoke, his fists clenched tightly. His gaze was resolute as he faced Li Xianzhao.

Zhou Yuanhao didn't know why Zhou Xiong had done this, but since he had ascended to True Immortal Intermediate, he felt Zhou Xiong was different. No longer the laughingstock of Yongsheng Mountain. However, others didn't know this.

What Zhou Yuanhao aimed to do was make everyone aware that he and his master would no longer be bullied.

“I don't want to live like this anymore. My master has changed; for my master, I would face fire and water!” Zhou Yuanhao's eyes burned with madness. He stepped forward, charging toward Li Xianzhao.

“Are you seeking death? He's Li Xianzhao!” The crowd roared. They hadn't expected Zhou Yuanhao to charge toward Li Xianzhao.

A powerful punch aimed at Li Xianzhao, but the response was Li Xianzhao's contempt.

“Boom…” In a flash, Li Xianzhao moved like lightning. His palm struck out with overwhelming momentum. As Zhou Yuanhao's fist approached, a green hand directly smacked onto Zhou Yuanhao’s body.

Zhou Yuanhao's eyes went white, collapsing to the ground. Blood flowed from his mouth.

“Boom…” Li Xianzhao stepped on Zhou Yuanhao's back, sneering: “How dare you even challenge me?”

“Zhou Xiong, hand over the elixir!” Li Xianzhao gazed at Zhou Xiong, directly calling out his name.

Disdain. Zhou Xiong and Zhou Yuanhao were like trash to Li Xianzhao. Even Zhou Xiong was no exception, though he wasn't yet Zhou Xiong's match. However, his master had once made Zhou Xiong kneel with a single word.

“Yuanhao hasn't lost yet!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. As his words finished, Li Xianzhao's face slightly changed. A searing pain shot up from his foot, causing him to lift it abruptly.

“Damn!” Li Xianzhao's eyes flashed with anger, gazing at the fresh red tooth marks on his ankle. Blood had soaked into Li Xianzhao's pristine robes.

“You're seeking death!” Li Xianzhao roared, stomping down again on Zhou Yuanhao's back. A crisp crack echoed from Zhou Yuanhao’s back, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, along with fragments of internal organs.

“Crack…” However, Zhou Yuanhao clamped down on Li Xianzhao's ankle with his teeth. His grip was so fierce that two teeth broke off.

“Call… the… elder…” Zhou Yuanhao spoke indistinctly, still clamping onto Li Xianzhao's ankle.

Hearing Zhou Yuanhao’s words, Luo Tian's body slightly trembled. He gazed at Zhou Yuanhao still clamping onto Li Xianzhao's ankle.

“Let go!” Li Xianzhao’s face darkened. His large hand repeatedly pressed down on Zhou Yuanhao's body.

But no matter how Li Xianzhao attacked, this time Zhou Yuanhao wouldn't let go. Blood flowed continuously.

Li Xianzhao really wanted to kill Zhou Yuanhao, but due to Luo Tian's presence, if he pushed too hard, he might not get a good outcome either.

“Zhou… elder, I suppose I’ve won!” Li Xianzhao finally had no choice but to look at Luo Tian.

Chapter 2464: Zhou Yuanhao's Progress

“Boom…” As Li Xianzhao’s words finished, Zhou Yuanhao finally released Li Xianzhao and collapsed onto the ground, breathing heavily.

“Of course!” Luo Tian smiled. He flicked his hand, and an elixir landed before Li Xianzhao.

“Thank you, Elder Zhou!” Li Xianzhao spoke softly, pocketing the elixir and leaving Luo Tian's courtyard.

“Really giving it!” The crowd murmured, watching Zhou Yuanhao lying lifeless on the ground.

“Any True Immortal Intermediate can torment Zhou Yuanhao!” People realized instantly, seeing a way to obtain sixth-grade elixirs.

“Alright, there's no more fighting today. Yuanhao’s condition isn’t suitable for further duels!” Luo Tian chuckled, addressing the crowd.

“Zhou Xiong, lend me a few of those sixth-grade elixirs. I’ll return them in half a month!” The only half-Immortal King elder looked at Luo Tian, his gaze flickering.

“Sorry, I won’t lend it!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He knew if he lent it, it would be a one-way deal. He wouldn’t do such a loss-making transaction.

“You dare not lend it?” The elder’s gaze turned cold, taking a step forward. His piercing gaze pressed onto Luo Tian, and his aura rose.

The elder was also surprised. The current Zhou Xiong was different from before. If it had been the past, Zhou Xiong would have trembled in fear.

“How has Elder Zhou changed?” The crowd murmured. They had never seen Zhou Xiong display such boldness before.

Luo Tian ignored the elder’s words. He took out the large pot again, poured the green liquid into it, and threw Zhou Yuanhao inside.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian had just thrown Zhou Yuanhao into the liquid, the half-Immortal King elder extended his hand and grabbed for Luo Tian.

“Get out…” Luo Tian’s eyes turned cold. He slapped his hand, and a black hand shot out with overwhelming power, striking toward the elder.

Boom…

The next moment, thunderous sounds erupted. The green hand shattered violently, but Luo Tian’s black hand continued flying toward the elder.

The solid black hand struck the elder's body, sending him flying out of the courtyard and landing on the ground in a messy heap.

“Puke…” Blood spewed from the elder’s mouth. His eyes held intense shock, gazing at Luo Tian standing there with a cold expression.

“How is this possible?” Everyone's faces were filled with disbelief. Their breathing echoed in the air.

“Is this Elder Zhou’s true strength?” The crowd murmured, watching Luo Tian.

“Elder Zhou was pretending to be weak before?” Soon after, people thought back to Zhou Xiong's past. Compared with now, he was a completely different person.

“I am no longer the one I used to be. Whoever wants to ride on my head, feel free to try!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, causing people to shiver.

In an instant, everyone scattered. Especially those True Immortals at their peak, who secretly felt relieved they hadn’t attacked Luo Tian.

After people had disappeared completely, Luo Tian turned his gaze to Zhou Yuanhao in the iron pot. After being nourished by the medicinal liquid, Zhou Yuanhao's injuries had begun to recover.

“The Gate of the Dao, the Meningeal Palace, the Dao gives rise to all things…” Luo Tian spoke continuously, reciting complex incantations into Zhou Yuanhao’s ears.

The Dao-Generating Scripture was a cultivation method Luo Tian had selected from the treasures given to him by ancient immortal ancestors in the ruins of the Ancient Celestial Court. Zhou Yuanhao, though severely wounded, remained in an unusual state due to the extreme pain, and he continuously followed Luo Tian's instructions to circulate the cultivation method.

Time passed slowly. Night fell quickly, and Luo Tian sat in meditation beside the large pot while Zhou Yuanhao continued to cultivate, absorbing the green liquid. The entire courtyard was unusually quiet, but one figure broke this silence.

A plump body, emitting a pungent fragrance. Her red lips and fatness made her appear like an obese woman, entering Zhou Xiong's courtyard with a gleam in her eyes as if it were her own home.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze puzzled for a moment before he suddenly recalled someone from Zhou Xiong's memories.

“Husband, come over!” The plump woman, capable of holding two Luo Tians, smiled with joy. Her fatty flesh quivered as she beckoned to Luo Tian.

“Shen Lingyuan, the younger sister of Elder Shen Tianchang from the inner sect. A half-Immortal King with a dual-cultivation method, often coming to Zhou Xiong's place and forcing him into cultivation…” Luo Tian’s mind immediately recalled Zhou Xiong's memories, his lips twitching.

“Elder Shen, what do you need?” Luo Tian feigned ignorance of the woman's words.

“You don’t know what to do? How long has it been, and you’ve already forgotten me?” As she spoke, the woman walked up to Luo Tian. Each step caused the ground to tremble thrice. A foul breath blew onto Luo Tian's face, almost making him vomit.

“I don’t know!” Luo Tian took two steps back to avoid the woman's breath, smiling.

“You’ve chosen me; it’s your fortune. Do you think your wings are strong now? I heard today that you were very powerful! Quickly, let that power be on me!” Shen Lingyuan saw Luo Tian stepping back and her face turned cold. As she spoke, her fatness swayed.

“Elder Shen, I truly lack the fortune to receive it!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. To be with such a person, he would rather die.

“Foolish thing!” Shen Lingyuan sneered. Her mountain-like body rushed toward Luo Tian and collided with him directly.

Luo Tian stood still. This was the second time he had heard such words today. He punched out, directly striking Shen Lingyuan’s body.

“Boom…” A dull sound rose in front of Luo Tian. Shen Lingyuan's body, like a meat ball, flew out and landed outside the courtyard, rolling several times before stopping.

“Zhou Xiong, wait for me. You can't escape!” Shen Lingyuan, though a half-Immortal King, had weaker strength than Zhou Xiong before. She relied solely on her brother's authority to dominate the outer sect.

Luo Tian washed his hands, a look of disgust on his face. He also sighed inwardly at the life Zhou Xiong had endured.

“Good progress!” Luo Tian gazed at Zhou Yuanhao in the medicinal liquid, his eyes filled with satisfaction. He didn’t care about Shen Lingyuan’s threat; he had seen such things too often. Luo Tian still had many ways to deal with it.

The next morning, the pot of medicinal liquid was completely diluted by Zhou Yuanhao. He emerged from the cauldron, full of energy again.

As dawn broke, figures appeared outside Zhou Xiong's courtyard. Their gazes were filled with amazement.

“I was worried Zhou Yuanhao wouldn’t recover, and I would cancel it today!”

“After just one night, such heavy injuries have recovered. What opportunity did Elder Zhou obtain!” People murmured lowly. The events of yesterday had spread throughout the outer sect, causing a stir over Zhou Sǒng's transformation into Zhou Xiong. The incident of one palm sending a half-Immortal King elder flying had caused a commotion in the outer sect.

People attributed Zhou Xiong's change of character to an astonishing inheritance he had obtained outside. Otherwise, how could he have so many elixirs?

“Go on! Just like yesterday, but I think you’ll be stronger today!” Luo Tian addressed Zhou Yuanhao.

“Alright, everyone. If you want to win the elixirs, feel free to duel my disciple!” Luo Tian addressed the crowd.

“I’ll go!” Instantly, several figures appeared. Unsurprisingly, all were True Immortals at their intermediate level.

Zhou Yuanhao clenched his fists. He knew these people were the best among the outer sect disciples, and winning against them would be extremely difficult.

Those vying for a duel finally lined up in order. A youth stepped forward, gazing at Zhou Yuanhao.

“Let’s fight! Try to minimize the number of elixirs my master loses!” Zhou Yuanhao thought, then rushed toward the youth.

The battle began instantly. However, it was only a moment before Zhou Yuanhao fell defeated, spitting blood and collapsing onto the ground.

“Next!” Luo Tian flicked his finger, and an elixir landed in the youth’s hand.

“Ah…” Zhou Yuanhao shouted, then fiercely fought against those people. One… two… These people seemed to have a默契 (mutual understanding), none of them beating Zhou Yuanhao as severely as yesterday. They knew that if they did, Zhou Yuanhao would lose mobility and Luo Tian would stop the duel. They wouldn’t have a chance to win those elixirs.

Luo Tian’s eyes remained smiling as he watched Zhou Yuanhao. Others only saw Zhou Yuanhao being beaten, but Luo Tian noticed Zhou Yuanhao’s potential—his defense and endurance were much stronger than others.

Soon, an hour passed. Zhou Yuanhao had fought five people and lost each time, but he still stood there.

“Add another hour!” Luo Tian raised his eyebrows slightly and addressed the crowd, causing them to rejoice. This time it was seven people. Zhou Yuanhao could no longer endure and collapsed onto the ground, becoming weak again.

“You hit too hard!” Those who hadn’t won elixirs blamed those people.

People left with dissatisfaction, no longer attempting to seize. However, they felt some urgency, fearing Luo Tian’s elixirs might suddenly run out.

Zhou Yuanhao again transmuted the medicinal liquid, his strength rapidly rising. Though painful, Zhou Yuanhao could even feel his cultivation was rapidly increasing—this sensation was indescribable.

The repetitive days began. The next day, the third day, Zhou Yuanhao was still being beaten. On the fourth day, he finally won a battle but was battered.

Chapter 2465: Zhou Li

“Again!” Zhou Yuanhao roared, striking a True Immortal Intermediate disciple and emitting a ruthless aura.

After several days of training, Zhou Yuanhao was no longer the one being beaten but had become evenly matched with those who came to duel. During these days, Luo Tian also distributed many sixth-grade elixirs, causing a storm in the outer sect of Yongsheng Mountain.

“Zhou Xiong obtained an astonishing inheritance. These days, he’s given out dozens of sixth-grade elixirs!”

“And Zhou Xiong and his disciple no longer act like before. They’ve learned to resist!”

“Who would have thought Zhou Xiong, who had been timid for hundreds of years, would now know how to resist!” People in Yongsheng Mountain discussed. Many disciples came seeking to duel Zhou Yuanhao and win a sixth-grade elixir.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s courtyard was bustling. Every day people came waiting for Luo Tian to announce the start of duels.

During these days, Luo Tian also went out a few times, heading to the inner sect. No one knew what he was doing.

“Elder Zhou, are you still taking disciples? I wish to become your disciple and serve at your side!”

“Do you even deserve to be Elder Zhou’s disciple?” Others also wanted to become Zhou Xiong's disciples, hoping to obtain elixirs from Luo Tian.

On the eighth day… Boom…

Zhou Yuanhao emerged as usual from the large pot, his body emitting a series of thunderous sounds. A green vortex appeared above his head, and vast spiritual energy descended, pouring into Zhou Yuanhao's body.

“This is an ascension!” People surrounding Zhou Xiong’s courtyard looked in disbelief, watching Zhou Yuanhao transmuting spiritual energy.

“Fairly good. It’s a day earlier than I expected!” Luo Tian nodded, his eyes filled with satisfaction. Zhou Yuanhao’s rise to this level during these days was naturally due to Luo Tian's elixirs and medicinal liquid, but it also had Zhou Yuanhao’s own efforts.

“My heavens! It's only been a few days. Last time he was at True Immortal Intermediate, now he’s at True Immortal Peak. Who could do this!” People immediately erupted in chaos, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were a god. They naturally knew Zhou Yuanhao’s ascension was greatly related to Luo Tian's methods.

“Master, please take me as your disciple!” Disciples rushed to the courtyard of Luo Tian and knelt before him, shouting loudly. The scene was spectacular.

As they spoke, several figures rushed out of the crowd, their faces filled with reverence.

“Master, your unworthy disciple, Zhou Li has returned!” A voice rang out. A young man knelt on the ground, his body radiating True Immortal Peak energy.

“Zhou Li!” People saw Zhou Li and immediately wore mocking expressions. However, Zhou Yuanhao's face turned dark.

Zhou Li and those behind him were the disciples that Zhou Xiong had once taken in. Zhou Li was of similar talent to Zhou Yuanhao, but he had a stronger cultivation base. Eventually, he defected to another elder's sect and even took all of Zhou Xiong’s disciples with him.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He knew all of Zhou Xiong’s past, naturally knowing about this disciple.

“Shameless! When Elder Zhou was weak, you discarded your gratitude and kicked him out!”

“Now that Elder Zhou is strong and has many elixirs, you’ve returned with your tail between your legs. You’re really shameless!” People murmured lowly, also deeply despising Zhou Li’s actions.

“Master, I’ve repented. I’ll never leave you again!” Zhou Li knelt before Luo Tian and spoke loudly, pretending to be repentant.

“Stay away!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly and addressed Zhou Li.

“Master, don’t you care about our years of friendship?” Zhou Li spoke. He knew Elder Zhou had a weakness—being soft-hearted.

“Everyone, is there anyone who wants to challenge my disciple? Today and tomorrow are the last days!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the crowd as if he hadn’t heard Zhou Li’s words.

“I’ll challenge!” As Luo Tian's words had barely finished, Zhou Li stood up from the ground and gazed at Zhou Yuanhao standing behind Luo Tian.

People were speechless, cursing Zhou Li's shamelessness. However, they had to admit that Zhou Li’s talent was indeed excellent. After leaving Elder Zhou, he defected to another half-Immortal King elder and his strength rapidly advanced. In just a few decades, he had become one of the top ten disciples in the outer sect, reaching True Immortal Peak.

“Since you don’t want to take me back as your disciple, I can only show you my strength!” Zhou Li spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian. His purpose in coming was to obtain elixirs. He hadn’t expected his pitiful master would change so much. Using emotional appeals didn't work, so he had no choice but to fight.

“Hope my master will change his mind!” Zhou Li smiled, slowly standing up and looking at Zhou Yuanhao with disdain.

“Go ahead!” Luo Tian didn’t object, addressing Zhou Yuanhao: “Go!”

“The top ten outer sect disciples, Zhou Li!”

“This isn’t bullying?” People immediately erupted in chaos. They looked at Luo Tian with confusion. Zhou Yuanhao had just fought True Immortal Intermediate disciples and was evenly matched, even being beaten. Now he faced the top ten disciple Zhou Li, who had reached True Immortal Peak. How could Elder Zhou think this was appropriate?

“Kill…” In an instant, Zhou Yuanhao and Zhou Li rushed toward each other. Enemies meeting, they were filled with hatred. Zhou Yuanhao had long wanted to teach Zhou Li a lesson for his fickle nature, even if he wasn’t Zhou Li’s match, he would make Zhou Li pay a price.

However, soon after, Zhou Yuanhao realized the gap between them. After one punch collided, he was sent flying back.

“Ah…” Zhou Yuanhao roared, wiping blood from his mouth. Like a madman, he rushed toward Zhou Li again.

Boom… Boom…

Next, another round of crushing blows. Zhou Yuanhao's body was constantly beaten back, falling onto the ground and kicking up a cloud of dust.

“Damn Zhou Li! You hit so hard!” People watched Zhou Li’s attack, their eyes filled with anger.

It wasn’t that they cared much for Zhou Yuanhao. If Zhou Li had crippled Zhou Yuanhao, they wouldn’t be able to fight either. However, Zhou Li was one of the top ten disciples; his master was also the first elder of the outer sect. Thus, they dared to be angry but couldn’t speak out.

“My younger brother, you are still a waste!” Zhou Li’s eyes glowed with amusement, looking down at him like an emperor.

“I…” Zhou Yuanhao spat blood, trembling as he stood up. His gaze was filled with despair.

“Why don’t I even have the right to injure him!” Zhou Yuanhao felt defeated. Even if he had ascended to True Immortal Peak, he was still no match for Zhou Li.

“Hum…” Next moment, Zhou Li’s body moved. He appeared beside Zhou Yuanhao and grabbed his neck, gazing at Luo Tian with amusement.

“Master, I was injured in the fight with my younger brother. Can you give me a few elixirs to recover? Otherwise, if I die, Master will be heartbroken, right?” Zhou Li gazed at Luo Tian and spoke coldly.

Threat. Everyone could hear Zhou Li’s threat. He was even daring to demand that Luo Tian kill his only disciple in front of him.

“Threaten me?” Luo Tian sneered. Being threatened by the Eternal Immortal King was one thing, but a mere True Immortal Peak disciple threatening him was another.

“That’s your own death!” Luo Tian sneered. His aura suddenly spread, still a half-Immortal King but the power made Zhou Li’s body freeze. His entire body felt cold, as if it wasn’t his own and wouldn’t obey.

Luo Tian extended his finger. A gust of wind shot out, and in the next moment, Zhou Li’s arm holding Zhou Yuanhao exploded into a mist of blood beside him.

“Soul Sealing!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed. He extended his hand, and a gray mist flew out from Zhou Li's body.

“Ah…” Zhou Li screamed. His right arm felt excruciating pain, and blood spilled in large amounts. People watching were shocked.

Luo Tian’s hand emitted a suction force, pulling Zhou Yuanhao's body toward him. Before Zhou Yuanhao could speak, Luo Tian threw him back into the medicinal liquid.

“Fellow disciples, if anyone can step on him once, I’ll give you one elixir. Two steps for five-grade elixirs! However, I also want to see your sincerity!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed the crowd. People fell silent.

Although Zhou Li was severely injured, appearing like a helpless victim, he had a master behind him. They couldn’t afford to provoke him.

Luo Tian watched people not moving and didn’t care. He knew someone would eventually give in. Five or six-grade elixirs were very useful for True Immortals.

“Boom…” Finally, one person stomped heavily on Zhou Li’s back. Zhou Li let out a painful scream.

“Who? Who stepped on me?” People shouted, but more people began to stomp on Zhou Li.

“Stop! He’s about to die!” After an hour, someone shouted, and people stopped their feet.

Luo Tian extended his hand. A series of elixirs flew out from his hands, landing before the crowd with precision—exactly matching the number of steps taken.

“Elder Zhou, how many elixirs do you have?” People murmured.

“It seems Elder Zhou doesn’t care about these five or six-grade elixirs at all. He just threw them away like trash!” People were in a uproar. The elixirs Luo Tian had thrown out totaled over one hundred, all five or six-grade.

“Zhou Xiong!” As people had just collected the elixirs, a furious voice rang out in their ears. They shivered.

A senior elder strode through the crowd, pushing people aside and stepping forward. Seeing Zhou Li lying like a pile of mud, his forehead veins bulged.

Chapter 2466: Zhang Daotian's whereabouts

“Zhou Xiong, you’re seeking death!” The elder approached Zhou Li and glared at Luo Tian.

“Senior Luoxiu!” People’s faces turned pale as they recognized the elder. He was Zhou Li's master, the first elder of the outer sect of Yongsheng Mountain. His strength and connections were terrifying.

Some people who had just stomped on Zhou Li chose to leave secretly.

“Senior Luoxiu, what’s the matter?” Luo Tian spoke softly. A half-Immortal King, he wouldn’t take it seriously.

“You killed my disciple. How do we settle this?” Luoxiu’s gaze was cold as he approached Zhou Li, his hands flashing green light to heal him.

“Killed? Has he died?”

“Even if he dies, what has Zhou Li done? Daring to threaten an outer sect elder. That’s insubordination. According to our Yongsheng Mountain rules, it's a capital crime!” Luo Tian roared, his voice like thunder and laced with madness, giving the impression of being cornered.

“Elder Zhou has been bullied for years. This outburst shows he doesn’t respect Senior Luoxiu anymore!” People erupted in chaos, looking at the outbursting Luo Tian.

“Y… you…” Luoxiu was speechless, unable to respond.

“What did I do? Senior Luoxiu, I’ve been tolerating you all these years. But now you’re still pushing me so hard. I, Zhou Xiong, will fight to the death to defend my last bit of dignity!” If it came to arguing, Luo Tian had no one to fear except Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin.

“Boom…” People watched as Luo Tian silenced Luoxiu, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“You’ll kill me!” Luoxiu roared and transformed into a dragon, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“I’m afraid you can’t kill me!” Luo Tian spoke coldly and struck his palm, colliding with Luoxiu’s hand.

The two palms collided. Thunderous sounds echoed. Both Luo Tian and Luoxiu stepped back, their mouths bleeding—though this was Luo Tian faking it.

People erupted in chaos. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to fight evenly with Luoxiu.

Though it was just one clash, people realized that Luo Tian was only slightly weaker than Luoxiu. It was impossible for Luoxiu to defeat Luo Tian.

“Senior Luoxiu, if there’s something you want to settle, go to the arena!” Luo Tian smiled and gazed at Luoxiu.

Two elders clashing was a big deal. Soon, other outer sect elders also arrived, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Elder Zhou, I heard he had become powerful. I didn’t expect him to reach such strength!” Elders’ faces were filled with surprise.

“Master, the elixir that helped me ascend to True Immortal Peak was given by him!” Li Xianzhao stood among the crowd and spoke to his master.

“Elder Zhou, come here!” The elder’s face showed a faint smile. He stepped out of the crowd and, at the same time, five more elders emerged, their auras fierce. Along with Elder Zhou and Luoxiu, they were the eight half-Immortal Kings of the outer sect.

“Su Tianyang!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, gazing at the elder who had stepped forward. He recalled it was this man who had once made Zhou Xiong kneel over a small matter.

“What are you?” Luo Tian responded strongly, his gaze sweeping over the elders. Clearly, these people had already secretly discussed and appeared together, including the half-Immortal King who had been knocked out by Luo Tian earlier.
