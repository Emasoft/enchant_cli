“Three of them are as if in harmony; even a half-step Epoch master before me is merely an ant, albeit stronger!” Ming Yongzhi’s face bore a cold expression as his hands moved swiftly, emitting waves of gray mist from his palms.

“Yin-Yang Reversal!” Ming Yongzhi sneered, and an endless stream of gray mist burst forth from his hands. This mist merged with the blood qi pouring out of the Blood-Refining Vessel, forming a crimson and gray Daoic diagram that descended upon Luo Tian and his companions with crushing force.

“Star Array!”

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram!” Faced with Ming Yongzhi’s technique forged through an Epoch relic, Luo Tian and his companions dared not show the slightest negligence. Their hands flashed with light, and a black demon map emerged from Luo Tian’s grasp. The techniques of the Profane Heaven’s Attack and the Unyielding Method were fused into this map, transforming it into a demonic sun that descended upon Ming Yongzhi’s technique.

Stars shimmered as the Star Array, an Epoch relic of the Star-Array Domain, took shape as a chessboard. The celestial bodies were activated by Zhou Tian, and countless stars plummeted onto the board.

Chapter 1196: Reinforcements from Two Domains

In the Thunder Domain, beneath the starry sky, four terrifying fluctuations rose. Chaos energy burst forth from Ming Yongzhi’s hands, forming a monstrous storm that devoured vast stretches of space and surged toward Luo Tian and his companions.

The black demon map, resembling a demonic sun, descended upon the chaotic storm—Luo Tian’s Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram.

In an instant, the diagram clashed with Yin-Yang Reversal, but it lasted only a moment before being annihilated by the storm.

“Indeed, an early Epoch master. Even with my full power, I could only shake their technique!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he marveled at the might of an Epoch relic wielded by a master of the early Epoch.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed as golden stars burst forth beneath the vast chessboard. Each star bore ancient characters etched upon it, radiating immense Epoch power. These characters seemed to grant the stars boundless strength, sweeping across the Yin-Yang storm.

“Boom… Boom…” The ancient characters on the stars exploded within the storm, further weakening its might.

The demon sword was unleashed by the Demon Lord, cleaving through heaven and earth as if splitting the cosmos. Its black blade struck the chaotic storm.

“Blocked!” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, watching the storm be severed by a single strike. His gaze turned solemn as he locked onto Ming Yongzhi.

“Kill!” Ming Yongzhi hurled the Blood-Refining Vessel, entangling the Star Array and demon sword. He then surged toward Luo Tian and his companions, knowing that if they did not escape the two Epoch relics, there would be no chance to slay them.

Luo Tian and his companions understood Ming Yongzhi’s intent. Though reluctant to part with the Epoch relics, their interwoven pull caused all three relics to vanish from sight.

Luo Tian roared, his fists swinging like a world-ending demon god. Without fear, he charged toward Ming Yongzhi.

Zhou Tian’s hand flicked, and celestial energy surged forth as meteors rained down—this was the “Starlight Illuminating the Azure Sky” technique Zhou Wei had once wielded. Yet, under Zhou Tian’s control, its power was even greater.

“Demon God’s Body Shattering!” The Demon Lord roared, realizing this was a battle to the death. He held nothing back, unleashing the ultimate secret technique of the Demon Clan.

Ming Yongzhi’s face twisted with disdain as he clashed with Luo Tian in close combat, simultaneously parrying the attacks of both the Demon Lord and Zhou Tian.

“Crack…” The stars exploded in a blinding flash, and Luo Tian’s fist met Ming Yongzhi’s. To the astonishment of all, Luo Tian suffered no injuries and even matched Ming Yongzhi’s strength.

“Indeed, a reincarnated body! With only a half-step Epoch mastery, he dares to fight an early Epoch master!” The crowd gasped in awe, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian.

Ming Yongzhi was equally stunned. He had not expected Luo Tian to be so formidable, capable of clashing with him in close combat. Ming Yongzhi’s eyes darkened as he parried both Zhou Tian and the Demon Lord’s attacks.

“What are you so surprised about?” As Ming Yongzhi marveled, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in his ears, jolting him from his thoughts.

“Boom…” Ming Yongzhi struck again, their fists colliding once more. His body recoiled slightly, but Luo Tian pressed forward relentlessly, granting Ming Yongzhi no respite.

“Easier now,” Zhou Tian and the Demon Lord exchanged glances. With Luo Tian holding Ming Yongzhi, they could unleash their strongest techniques to crush him.

Three battlefields roared with thunderous clashes, each sending shockwaves through the heavens.

“Don’t just stand there! Eliminate the remaining scum of the Shadow Domain!” Xu Liziyi and Zheng Xin shouted, leading their forces to surround the remaining Shadow Domain warriors.

“Impossible!” Ming Yongzhi’s eyes flashed with coldness as he saw the Shadow Domain warriors encircled. He continued fending off Luo Tian’s attacks with one hand while weaving seals with the other, sending waves of gray mist into the void.

“Soul Summoning!” Ming Yongzhi bellowed, and countless seals coalesced into a gray altar. From it, waves of mist formed human silhouettes, shielding the Shadow Domain warriors.

“Soul spirits?” Gu Lei and others stared in grim silence, sensing the familiar aura within the souls.

“Familiar presence—these are the spirits of those who perished in the battle, summoned by another method!” Gu Lei murmured, feeling the unmistakable resonance.

“Roar…” The souls howled, their voices echoing as they lunged toward Gu Lei’s group.

“You should be able to hold them off for a while,” Ming Yongzhi sneered, his body battered from Luo Tian’s relentless assault. “Once I finish these three, I’ll deal with you scum!”

“Even when alive, we feared no one. Now that you’ve become souls, what are you afraid of?” Gu Lei and Zheng Xin roared, charging toward the gray spirits.

The Thunder Domain trembled again, but this time, the allied forces suffered heavy losses. Though the souls were weakened, they still inflicted casualties. Worse, their numbers had reached a terrifying scale—eradicating them would cost countless lives and time.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian and his companions clashed with Ming Yongzhi in a whirlwind of blows. In mere moments, the four had exchanged countless strikes.

The battlefield returned to a stalemate; neither side could overcome the other.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s fists rained down, forcing Ming Yongzhi into disarray. Though he did not retreat entirely, his movements were frantic.

“Kid, stop wasting your strength—you can’t beat me!” Ming Yongzhi clashed with Luo Tian again, sending him flying.

“Hmph, you’re anxious,” Luo Tian retreated momentarily before striking again. He knew Ming Yongzhi was desperate.

“Kid, you’re forcing me to pay a price! I’ll finish the three of you!” Ming Yongzhi’s eyes darkened, spitting blood that formed a mist before him.

“Divine Spirit Transformation!” The blood mist coalesced into crimson seals, merging with Ming Yongzhi’s body.

“Crack…” A sound of something shattering echoed as Ming Yongzhi’s power surged. His aged body radiated a radiant glow, awakening boundless vitality.

“Secret technique?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing the terrifying vitality radiating from Ming Yongzhi. His face bore a flicker of awe.

“Even in the Epoch realm, there are techniques to enhance strength!” The Demon Lord and Zhou Tian were equally stunned. As disciples of sacred sects, they had never encountered such a method.

Ming Yongzhi’s aged body gradually rejuvenated, his flesh radiating pressure that made Luo Tian more wary.

“Feeling young again is delightful! Kid, I’ll finish you first!” Ming Yongzhi clenched his fists, and waves of gray mist burst from his fingers. He met Luo Tian’s punch with a strike of his own.

“Boom…” The evenly matched combat turned when Ming Yongzhi unleashed Divine Spirit Transformation. Luo Tian was sent flying a hundred feet, his fist cracked and trembling in shock.

“This is the Shadow Domain! This is me, Ming Yongzhi! Do you think we’ve plagued the Nine Domains in vain?” Ming Yongzhi sneered, unleashing Yin-Yang Reversal again. A storm of chaos tore through the void, attacking Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He had not expected Ming Yongzhi to be this powerful, even with the three of them ganging up on him.

“Big brother, don’t fear! I’m here!” As Luo Tian prepared to parry Ming Yongzhi’s attack, a deep roar echoed through the Thunder Domain. Dragon power surged, and dragon roars drowned out the battlefield’s cries of war.

The roar shook the Thunder Domain’s stars, sending a heavy pressure through all minds.

“That’s Long Jie—the Beast Domain! The Beast Domain has arrived!” The allied forces sighed in relief, gazing at the shattered stars with joy.

Roars of fury echoed as various beasts emerged from the void, a million-strong army charging toward the gray souls.

“Haha, Zhou Xiong, did I arrive too late?” As the crowd rejoiced at the Beast Domain’s arrival, a crimson torrent surged from another direction. A killing intent permeated the stars. Cloaked in black veils, millions of warriors marched forward, their eyes cold and chilling.

“The Shura Domain has arrived?” The crowd gasped at the sight of the millions of reinforcements and their leader, Yan Xiuluo.

“Boom…” The divine light from the Beast Domain’s relic, the Divine Emperor Mirror, illuminated the stars. It surged toward Ming Yongzhi, who was clashing with Luo Tian and his companions.

The Beast Domain’s relic, the Divine Emperor Mirror, was well-known to all. None had expected their long-awaited reinforcements to arrive at this critical moment.

The divine light swept over the allied forces, instantly healing their wounds. Yet when it touched Ming Yongzhi’s soul formations conjured through special means, it acted as a natural counter. The souls shrieked, as if purified, dissolving into white smoke before vanishing from sight.

“Damn it!” Ming Yongzhi’s face darkened, his gaze fixed on the divine mirror. He knew this battle might end in failure for the Shadow Domain.

“Boom…” Luo Tian struck again, clashing with Ming Yongzhi. His body recoiled, sweat drenching his brow. The strength of a master who had used a secret technique was overwhelming. Luo Tian could only endure through his unparalleled flesh, while the Demon Lord and Zhou Tian would have already bled out.

“Boom… Boom…” Ming Yongzhi took two steps back as Zhou Tian and the Demon Lord’s attacks struck him. They only managed to make him slightly disheveled, causing no real harm.

“Boom…” The divine light swept across thousands of miles, annihilating Ming Yongzhi’s soul formations before turning its gaze upon him.

“Sizzle…” White smoke rose from Ming Yongzhi’s body as his flesh, which even Luo Tian could not harm, bore a deep wound under the divine light. Epoch energy danced over the injury, rendering it irreparable as blood spattered.

Ming Yongzhi’s body recoiled thousands of feet before halting, his gaze dark and resolute as he stared at the Divine Emperor Mirror hovering above.

“Wail…” As Ming Yongzhi regained his composure, the void behind him silently cracked. Even he had not noticed it until he heard the wail. A streak of blood light shot forth, moving at impossible speed.

“Plop…” Blood splattered as a crimson head pierced Ming Yongzhi’s heart, exiting through his back. It was revealed to the crowd.

“You seem to have forgotten me!” Yan Xiuluo’s body radiated blood energy, his aura filled with ruthless intent. His crimson head hovered above him like a ghostly specter.

“Another Epoch relic!” Ming Yongzhi’s eyes flickered, repairing his wounds with a look of awe.

“Indeed, you’ve honored me with four Epoch relics and even a fragment! Such an array would be fatal for any mid-Epoch master!” Ming Yongzhi’s awe turned to a smirk as he surveyed the group with amusement.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s heart quivered at Ming Yongzhi’s gaze, a sense of dread stirring within him.

“If that’s the case, then you shall die!” Yan Xiuluo ignored Ming Yongzhi’s tricks. With four Epoch relics, they could annihilate him without mercy.

“Boom…” Long Jie’s face was cold as he and the remaining Beast Domain elders activated the Divine Emperor Mirror, striking Ming Yongzhi again.

The crimson head vanished silently from Yan Xiuluo’s head, disappearing into the void like a shadow assassin.

“I’ve completed my task!” Ming Yongzhi ignored the remaining dozens of Shadow Domain warriors, including several masters at the peak of their power. He moved his hands, sending waves of gray seals into the void.

“Crack…” As the seals dispersed, the blue copper vessel—once clashing with the Beast and Star Array domains—emerged from the void. It poured out endless blood qi into Ming Yongzhi’s body, instantly restoring his strength.

The blue copper vessel bore ancient seals, clearly damaged from the clash.

“By the heavens, four Epoch relics! Such a scene hasn’t occurred in years!” The crowd marveled at the relics hovering above the stars.

“Boom… Boom…” The four who activated the relics exchanged glances, their eyes flashing with killing intent. They surged forward without hesitation toward Ming Yongzhi.

The divine light roared as Ming Yongzhi raised the Blood-Refining Vessel, forming a crimson barrier to shield himself.

“Boom… Boom…” The four relics descended, but before they could break the crimson barrier, the remaining dozens of Shadow Domain warriors were obliterated. Even masters at the peak of their power vanished in an instant.

“Powerful! This is an Epoch relic! Who could withstand four of them?” The crowd trembled, watching the masters perish under the overwhelming pressure.

The four Epoch relics crushed the heavens and earth, their might instantly clashing with Ming Yongzhi’s crimson barrier. The blue copper vessel howled, its surface flashing cracks.

“Crack…” Ming Yongzhi’s body sank further as blood spewed from his mouth, his face pale. His flesh cracked extensively, and he could not endure much longer. Once the crimson barrier was shattered, it would be his end.

As the crowd awaited Ming Yongzhi’s demise, the nine continents of the Shadow Domain mysteriously aligned in a straight line.

“Boom…” The first and second continents exploded, revealing an old man seated in the gray void. His aged body radiated immense pressure.

“Nine Stars Converge? Finally, it has come!” The old man spoke slowly, his eyes opening to reveal a weathered aura. His gaze turned toward the third continent, which was already cracking.

“Boom…” As the old man watched, the third continent exploded, revealing another old man in gray robes who opened his eyes.

“Fourth Continent… Fifth Continent… Ninth Continent!” In moments, all nine continents shattered, and eight old men emerged from the now-empty void of the Shadow Domain.

“Elder Nine, you’re in danger!” The seven old men gazed at the ninth continent’s shattered remains where an old man sat. Their eyes held reverence.

“Elder One, there’s trouble!” The leader of the group opened his eyes and extended a hand. The void exploded, revealing a massive gray hand that pierced through the stars.

“Has it begun? I feel time is near,” Ming Yongzhi, whose face had been pale, seemed to sense something. His eyes flickered with a smile as he ignored the immense pressure from the four relics about to crush him.

“Crack…” The sound of shattered stars echoed as Daoic patterns covered the heavens, as if the entire void had fractured. In awe, the crimson barrier shattered.

At the moment of its collapse, Ming Yongzhi’s early Epoch body burst apart, and his gray soul floated free, gradually dissipating.

“Finally, it’s over!” Luo Tian and the others sighed in relief, watching Ming Yongzhi’s soul being eroded. Their eyes held a flicker of joy.

“Boom… Boom…” As the crowd believed Ming Yongzhi was dead, a massive gray hand severed the stars. It seized the crimson Blood-Refining Vessel and pulled it toward itself, its immense suction instantly drawing Ming Yongzhi’s soul into the vessel.

“Do you think this is over? This is only the beginning!” Ming Yongzhi’s ghostly soul sneered, its form vanishing into the vessel.

“Boom…” The blue copper vessel was riddled with cracks, held by the massive gray hand before vanishing into the void.

“What technique is this?” The crowd was stunned, feeling the pressure from the gray hand. Their hearts heavy with dread.

“Beyond starfields, retrieving an Epoch relic—this is a mid-Epoch master!” The domain lords gathered, exchanging glances with tension.

“Mid-Epoch!” The word felt like a mountain pressing on their hearts. Facing the nine masters of the Shadow Domain, who could match them except for a few sacred sects?

“What do we do?” The group exchanged glances, feeling the heavy pressure.

“Cough… Cough! What’s a mid-Epoch master or an Epoch ruler? The soul of the Divine and Demon Sect’s diagram is nothing but trash!” As the crowd felt heavy, a weak figure emerged from the void.

“Pfft…” Seeing this figure, people couldn’t help but laugh—it was too absurd.

The figure had transformed into a skeletal body, its skull riddled with cracks. One arm was missing, and the skull hung from a broken limb. Its once-gleaming body had dimmed, losing its divine aura.

Yet soon, the crowd’s laughter faded as they stared in awe at the soul of the Yin Fish. They knew what it had faced.

Chapter 1198: Unending Slaughter

“Thankfully, it was just a projection of an Epoch master. If it were stronger, I might have truly died!” The Yin Fish’s soul, hanging from an arm, spoke repeatedly. Its black flames flickered as if about to die, clearly wounded. Yet seeing the crowd’s awe, it was proud.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian bowed to the Yin Fish’s soul, his eyes filled with gratitude. He could imagine the battle it had endured—against a projection of an Epoch master, even if it was just a shadow.

“Don’t thank me; I’m the one who got unlucky and chose you. Back then, the Divine and Demon Sect’s master was so mighty! I’ve never suffered such humiliation. How many years has it been? Damn it!” The Yin Fish’s soul cursed, ignoring others entirely.

Though so, no one dared to argue. Though it was just a soul, it had emerged from an artifact and defeated the projection of an Epoch master. Its combat power was unquestionably superior to theirs.

“Hmph, four Epoch relics, but we were stronger back then!” The Yin Fish’s soul sneered, its gaze filled with disdain as it looked at the relics above.

“Boom…” As if understanding the Yin Fish’s words, the four Epoch relics emitted a deep hum. Their light flared, radiating overwhelming pressure even without being activated. They seemed to protest.

“Ugh…” The Yin Fish’s soul shivered, its bones creaking as it spoke: “Just kidding! Don’t take it seriously!”

It then slinked into the Yin Fish’s Tortoise Shell, making Luo Tian chuckle.

“Hmph! If I were whole, I wouldn’t fear these guys!” The Yin Fish’s soul grumbled in Luo Tian’s mind. He ignored it.

“Luo Tian, congratulations on reaching half-Epoch!” Yan Xiuluo and others gazed at Luo Tian with admiration. They hadn’t expected him to reach half-Epoch so quickly, matching their own power as domain lords.

“Thank you. Since all of you are here, let’s discuss how to face the next battle,” Luo Tian shook his head, his expression darkening. He addressed Zhou Tian and Yan Xiuluo.

“Sun Shengtian, that bastard hasn’t come to help yet!” Yan Xiuluo spoke without restraint, cursing.

“Also, the Chaos Domain hasn’t arrived!” Zhou Tian murmured, clearly unimpressed with their absence.

“Never mind; it’s over now. At least we won this battle!” The Demon Lord spoke, but his face was grim. This first battle had been too brutal. With 1.5 million Shadow Domain disciples and over three million total, only a few hundred thousand remained. And Ming Yongzhi had escaped. Though they didn’t know when he’d recover, with the Shadow Domain’s methods, he would likely return to life soon.

“I’m most worried about the mid-Epoch master they saved—what if others are as strong?” Luo Tian’s face bore a grim expression.

“Indeed, our sects have resources, but no mid-Epoch strength. Even if we’re strong, we fall short of true mid-Epoch masters!” Yan Xiuluo shook his head. Others frowned, and the stars fell silent.

“Now, we should return to our own starfields. Though we can support now, if it truly comes to life or death, there may be no time for you,” Yan Xiuluo gazed at Luo Tian. His meaning was clear.

“Hmph.” Luo Tian nodded. If mid-Epoch masters attacked, even countless reinforcements would be useless. They’d be crushed in an instant.

Yet as Luo Tian and the others pondered how to face the Shadow Domain, in the stars of the Four Sacred Domains, an old man bore a cruel smile. He gazed at Tongtian Continent and its surrounding lands, his power gradually rising. His gaze was calm as he walked toward the core Tongtian Continent.

“This is the Fire Domain, still so weak!” The old man spoke softly, stepping forward. Each step caused stars to fall and continents to collapse.

“Shriek!” A scream echoed across the stars, as the inhabited lands surrounding Tongtian Continent were instantly annihilated. Whether cultivators or commoners, they vanished into the void like the end of days.

On Tongtian Mountain, the ancient heavenly palace emitted a deep hum, swiftly flying into the stars to shield Tongtian Continent.

“What’s happening?” Those on Tongtian Mountain felt the palace’s unease, their eyes flashing.

“Palace warning!” Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brow, moving instantly to the domain’s outskirts.

Others followed Jiang Nanxuan into the void, including Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and many from the Four Sacred Domains and Fire Domain who had supported the Thunder Domain. They all stood beneath the stars.

But soon, they witnessed a terrifying sight—a star collapsing, blood qi swirling into rivers of crimson surrounding the old man.

“Bad!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face changed, and without hesitation, he activated the ancient palace to absorb everyone.

“Why do this? One person! I should be able to fight him! Those who died were our people!” Someone shouted, eyes red with fury.

“Don’t you dare talk nonsense! Don’t resist; this is beyond our power! Even with the ancient palace, it’s uncertain we’ll survive!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face was wild. The man who rarely cursed now raged.

“Boom…” The ancient palace continued absorbing people from both domains, while the old man calmly advanced toward it.

“Oh, Jiang Lingxiao’s ancient palace! It’s rare to see such an artifact from that old domain!” The old man gazed at the golden palace, his eyes filled with nostalgia. Yet his steps quickened.

Not only the Four Sacred Domains, but other domains faced the same fate. Each domain had an old man, like a messenger of hell, ruthlessly harvesting lives.

“Shriek! Who are you? Why!” In the Beast Domain, an old man walked through the stars, advancing toward the Holy City.

“Your Beast Domain’s Holy City will not escape!” A beast roared, its body exploding in a burst of blood. The domain was filled with blood qi.

“Don’t worry, your Holy City will be gone soon!” The old man smiled.

In the Divine and Demon Domain, Sun Shengtian gazed at rising blood qi, activating his Divine Sword to shield the newly built divine mountain.

“Not sure how the Demon Clan is doing,” Sun Shengtian sighed, sensing a great era was approaching. Even the divine clan faced extinction.

The Demon Clan fared no better, their high-ranking officials like the Demon Lord and Nan Gong Bo had led all to support the Thunder Domain. Now, the Demon Clan was unusually empty, its people filled with fear as the blood qi-wreathed old man approached.

“Grandmaster of the Demon Clan, please emerge to protect your descendants!” Three Grandmasters stood on an altar, their blood spilled to summon the clan’s resources. The old man’s pressure was too great.

In the Star Array and Shura Domains, both faced similar fates. Their domain lords had brought Epoch relics to support the Thunder Domain. Without them, they relied on Grandmasters to communicate with their resources.

The Nine Domains plunged into endless chaos as these old men appeared, screams echoing everywhere. Blood qi rose across the Nine Domains, with countless lives lost every moment.

“Great elders of our domain! Please emerge and save us!” A cultivator cried out, hoping for a great elder to appear and send this devil away.

But soon, despair overtook them as no movement came. These old men continued harvesting lives, melting blood qi into their bodies. Their aged forms gradually rejuvenated.

In the Thunder Domain, after discussing how to face the Shadow Domain, Luo Tian and his group had no solution. They chose to return to their own starfields temporarily.

The Shadow, Beast, and Shura Domains had already departed in batches via teleportation arrays. Only Luo Tian and his group remained.

“Tianzhi, you really won’t come with us to the Fire Domain?” At the Thunder Domain’s teleportation array, Luo Tian’s gaze held concern as he addressed Li Tianzhi.

“No, the Thunder Domain has so few left. I’ll lead them into the Thunder Sea Marsh. I’m sure the Shadow Domain’s Nine Masters won’t dare enter it!” Li Tianzhi shook his head, explaining his plan. The Thunder Domain was too weak now, with only a few hundred thousand left.

“Alright, maybe I’ll bring both domains to your Thunder Sea Marsh for a while too!” Luo Tian smiled, patting Li Tianzhi’s shoulder.

“We should go,” Luo Tian sighed, looking at the over a hundred thousand people standing there. This support for the Thunder Domain had cost them heavily, with the Four Sacred and Fire Domains losing nearly nine out of ten. The losses were too great.

Chapter 1199: A Challenge

In the Fire Domain, on Tongtian Mountain, Luo Tian and Gu Lei’s group appeared. Upon arrival, their faces darkened instantly as a strong scent of blood filled their senses.

“What’s happening?” They saw the former Fire Domain’s lair, Tongtian Mountain, now shrouded by a golden heavenly palace.

Thunderous roars echoed as an old man emerged from the Shadow Domain, his body wreathed in blood qi. Yet he was no longer an old man but a middle-aged figure, his appearance constantly shifting.

“Who is he?” Luo Tian’s heart pounded as he felt the pressure radiating from him.

“His name is Ming Xiuyan—this is one of the Nine Masters of the Shadow Domain!” Jiang Nanxuan’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. The ancient palace roared, enveloping them with a light screen.

“Oh? Another one has arrived?” Ming Xiuyan smiled, extending his hand. As the light screen descended, a massive gray hand surged forth, severing space and reaching toward Luo Tian’s group.

Luo Tian’s group numbered over a hundred thousand. Even with the ancient palace absorbing them, it would take time. In that moment, the gray hand arrived instantly.

“Get inside!” Luo Tian’s face turned wild as he stood at the group’s rear, his Yin Fish Tortoise Shell hovering above him. Under his command, it transformed into a black star, colliding with the old man’s hand.

Thunderous roars echoed through space. The returning group from the Thunder Domain spat blood, but thanks to Luo Tian’s protection, no one died.

“Oh? A fragment of an Epoch relic? You must be Luo Tian! I am Ming Xiuyan, one of the Nine Masters of the Shadow Domain!” The old man—now a middle-aged figure—spoke to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian spat blood, his gaze fixed on Ming Xiuyan with intense caution. The previous strike had nearly overwhelmed him, relying on the Tortoise Shell to deflect most of the power. He had only endured a fraction, yet he was still wounded. His indomitable flesh bore cracks, leaving him awestruck by Ming Xiuyan’s strength.
