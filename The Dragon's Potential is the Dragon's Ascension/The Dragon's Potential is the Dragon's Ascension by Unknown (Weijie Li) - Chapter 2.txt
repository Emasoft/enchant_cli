With Li Weijie’s pouring out his heart, tears welled up again. Perhaps because he had already regarded Su Yuyan as a family member deep in his heart, Li Weijie did not deliberately hide his emotions before her.

Su Yuyan’s eyes were filled with tears as she stood up and walked to Li Weijie’s side. Her fair, lotus-like arms embraced his head, and she spoke gently: “Cry! Let it all out…”

In a daze, Li Weijie seemed to have returned to his childhood. Accompanied by grievances, his childhood was not happy. And when he cried to the orphanage director that he had been bullied again, she would always comfort him in this gentle way.

Li Weijie buried his head deeply into Su Yuyan’s high, soft bosom and cried like a child there, as if the freely flowing tears would take away all his sorrow from his heart.

Unconsciously, Li Weijie’s hands naturally embraced Su Yuyan’s slender waist.

“Cry! Let it all out, and you’ll feel better…”

Su Yuyan’s delicate hand gently patted Li Weijie’s back, and her crystal tears could not help but fall.

Li Weijie was like a wanderer who had been bullied outside, releasing his sorrowful emotions in the warm embrace of his mother.

Unknowingly how much time had passed, Li Weijie’s tears finally dried up. His spirit and senses gradually returned, the soft, elastic touch and the refreshing fragrance making his head buzz. He was now in an intimate embrace with Su Yuyan.

---

**Chapter 006: Delusion**

Li Weijie’s head was deeply buried between Su Yuyan’s high, full and round snow-white breasts. His arms were tightly embracing her slender waist.

Through the gap in Su Yuyan’s collar, Li Weijie could see a pair of breasts with oscillating power…

An unusual impulse arose in Li Weijie’s heart. He gently left Su Yuyan’s embrace, his face blushing as he said softly: “Teacher Mother… thank you…”

“Foolish child, what are you thanking me for?”

Su Yuyan’s tone was intimate as she patted Li Weijie’s forehead and turned towards the bathroom.

Women are all clean-loving, Su Yuyan’s chest had been wet by Li Weijie’s tears and now she was cleaning herself in the bathroom.

Su Yuyan wore a white, gauzy short skirt and a red pure cotton T-shirt. However, that thin T-shirt seemed unable to bear the weight of her two mounds…

Su Yuyan did not close the bathroom door as she entered, washing her exposed chest without hesitation.

Li Weijie had been crying for the whole afternoon and now felt parched. He stood up to get a drink of water but his gaze suddenly fixed on something…

He saw Su Yuyan gently putting her hand into the slightly open collar of her red pure cotton T-shirt, adjusting the bra straps and cups that had slipped during their embrace. Her lively breasts were repositioned in her hand.

“My God! How beautiful, what did I just see…”

Li Weijie suddenly felt an urge to shout out loud.

He really wanted to rush over and put the pink bud in his mouth, but he knew clearly that Su Yuyan was a woman like a mother and sister to him. He knew he had seen something he shouldn’t have.

So, Li Weijie quietly retreated and tiptoed back to the dining table.

When Su Yuyan came out again, her tear marks had disappeared. She handed Li Weijie a wet towel and smiled: “Come, wipe your face?”

Li Weijie silently took the towel and mechanically wiped his face. Seeing Su Yuyan’s calm expression, he knew she had not noticed his indiscreet gaze and the unease in his heart gradually dissipated.

“Weijie, how are you?”

Su Yuyan looked at Li Weijie and said softly: “Do you feel better after crying?”

Li Weijie nodded, feeling somewhat embarrassed as he looked at the wet marks on Su Yuyan’s chest: “Teacher Mother, I’m sorry…”

“Men’s tears are more moving than women’s.”

Su Yuyan paused, then smiled seductively: “But you can only cry once. After crying, forget the unpleasant memories and start a new life.”

Li Weijie’s eyes suddenly brightened but then dimmed, sighing softly and not knowing what to say.

After dinner, Su Yuyan cleared the dishes. Li Weijie bid farewell and left.

A moment later, Li Weijie knocked on Su Yuyan’s door again. He had forgotten his key in a hurry earlier, and it was getting late; the locksmiths were all closed.

Li Weijie, penniless, did not know where to go. He also did not want his close friends to see him in this state, so he finally knocked on Su Yuyan’s door.

Su Yuyan looked at the hesitant young man who had come over to tell her about forgetting his key, and couldn’t help but giggle. She then invited him in; she lived in a three-bedroom apartment with an empty guest room.

The two sat on the sofa watching TV, and it was soon nine o’clock.

“Hmm…”

Su Yuyan lazily raised her hands, pushing out her high, soft breasts as she stretched languidly.

When Su Yuyan pushed up her chest, Li Weijie noticed two bowl-shaped hemispheres faintly appearing under her T-shirt; they were the cups of her bra.

Originally staring at the TV, Li Weijie’s gaze was involuntarily drawn to Su Yuyan’s full and high breasts, his body reacting with shame. A lewd voice whispered in his ear: “What a pair of round, trembling full breasts!”

Su Yuyan noticed Li Weijie’s gaze and realized her unseemly posture. She quickly lowered her hands, her face flushed as she pretended nothing was amiss: “Weijie, watch TV. I’ll be back.”

She blushed and hurried into the bathroom, feeling somewhat embarrassed.

Su Yuyan entered the bathroom, and soon water sounds were heard.

Li Weijie suddenly felt a strong urge to peek at Su Yuyan bathing.

<><><><><><><><><><><><> The lecherous mind often overcomes everything. With trembling hands, Li Weijie rushed in without hesitation…

Water splashed down; Su Yuyan had her back to him, arms crossed over her chest. Her plump and long legs, rounded and uplifted buttocks, slender waist like willow branches, and skin as smooth as jade were truly a masterpiece of nature’s art.

Facing his sudden intrusion, Su Yuyan did not scream as Li Weijie imagined; instead, she said coquettishly: “What are you staring at? Never seen a woman before?”

As she spoke, Su Yuyan turned her head to reveal the deep and alluring cleavage between her arms.

Li Weijie gazed into her eyes filled with tenderness, Su Yuyan first lowered her head shyly and then looked up bravely to meet his gaze.

Slowly walking over, letting the water soak his clothes, Li Weijie met Su Yuyan under the showerhead.

Li Weijie embraced her waist, and his body felt an electric current. He suddenly lowered his head to kiss Su Yuyan’s soft, warm lips.

Su Yuyan kissed him wildly; Li Weijie’s actions gradually became rougher, kissing her white neck and rubbing her high breasts…

Her flat, smooth abdomen and plump thighs rubbed against his body. Li Weijie’s hands roamed over every inch of Su Yuyan’s beautiful skin with the water.

“Give it to me, quickly…”

Su Yuyan murmured, seemingly unable to bear the stimulation. Her soft body hung on Li Weijie’s, one snow-white leg raised and wrapped around his waist.

Standing was not suitable for intercourse; Li Weijie withdrew his penis, letting Su Yuyan lie down in the bathtub.

He bent to kiss her lips, his right hand busy with her peaks and then kissed her breasts while his right hand moved to the entrance.

Su Yuyan was already flooded with desire, and after being teased further, she could no longer hold back. Li Weijie’s middle finger entered the entrance and explored.

Su Yuyan had already spread her legs, welcoming him.

Seeing it was time, Li Weijie stood in the bathtub and used an old man’s posture, holding his penis to grind against her clitoris.

Su Yuyan was ground until her face turned red, panting heavily with passion and soft moans.

“Ah… Teacher Mother feels so uncomfortable all over, stop grinding me… don’t tease me anymore… I can’t hold it any longer… come in, quickly…”

Li Weijie was aroused by Su Yuyan’s coquettish demeanor. His blood rushed, and his penis swelled as he thrust forward with a “sizzle,” entering her.

“Ah… Ah… It hurts… it’s killing me…”

Li Weijie felt his penis tightly embraced by thick, tender flesh. The heat inside was like fire; he couldn’t believe how tight and small Su Yuyan’s entrance was. He paused.

He leaned down to kiss her lips deeply, lifting his hips and entering another three inches.

“Here…”

Wildly entering, the warmth and tightness made Li Weijie’s body tremble.

“Ah… Ah… Stop… it hurts… ah…”

With a low moan, Su Yuyan’s head tilted back, her hands gripping his hair tightly. “You’re going to drive me crazy… ah…”

Su Yuyan was driven by Li Weijie’s thick, strong member to the point of losing her senses. Her desire flowed freely, her eyes wide and her plump buttocks swaying wildly. Her flower opening and closing, panting heavily with passion.

Although she was almost unconscious from being penetrated, she still fought on with all her might.

Su Yuyan lifted her legs onto Li Weijie’s shoulders, her entrance rising. He held up her buttocks with his hands and increased the speed of thrusting, each time deeply stimulating her secret place.

Su Yuyan was hit by wave after wave of pleasure, beginning to lose herself in moans.

Li Weijie increased the speed to its limit and continued moving.

Su Yuyan’s body trembled, her walls contracting rapidly. Suddenly she screamed and stiffened as a powerful climax hit her, trembling uncontrollably with lingering pleasure.

Li Weijie felt the walls of her entrance contracting. An unprecedented impulse rose from his abdomen, a spasm, and his head tingled as he rubbed her flower several times. His member jumped in her warm place, the tip entering her uterus and receiving a scalding stimulation. A hot stream of semen suddenly shot into the depths of Su Yuyan’s uterus, causing her to tremble again. The two bodies were intoxicated in the pleasure of their intimate embrace.

Looking at the chapter title, everyone should know that all this was Li Weijie’s delusion. Although vivid and realistic, it was all in his imagination.

In fact, Li Weijie sat upright on the sofa watching an unknown TV host cooing at the audience.

**Chapter 007: Temptation**

Li Weijie sat on the sofa, imagining Su Yuyan bathing in the bathroom. Suddenly he felt like a very lecherous person.

In the bathroom, water stopped, followed by the sound of the door opening and footsteps fading away.

The fragrance wafted over; Li Weijie turned to see Su Yuyan standing beside him. She wore a black, gossamer thin nightgown that revealed her curvaceous figure and smooth skin. Her rosy cheeks, flushed from the hot water, were as delicate as peach blossoms.

Two firm and full breasts protruded under her red lacy bra, with a small portion of white flesh peeking out from the edges.

Her smooth abdomen, slender waist, uplifted buttocks, and long legs covered by a triangle panty that bulged slightly.

Wearing such an alluring nightgown, Su Yuyan showed no hesitation in front of him. Was he such a man that women trusted?

After Su Yuyan bathed, it was Li Weijie’s turn. On such a hot day, even with air conditioning, not bathing before sleeping made him feel uncomfortable.

Li Weijie entered the bathroom. It was spacious, with a washing machine, Su Yuyan’s bath towels and toiletries, and a clean bathtub.

Thinking about bathing in the tub where Su Yuyan had just bathed, Li Weijie’s face flushed with excitement.

But he quickly reminded himself that Su Yuyan was his respected teacher mother, and he must not have any lecherous thoughts.

Just as he thought this, Li Weijie suddenly became excited. He saw a hanger above the bathtub with three small women’s panties, each adorned with lace.

Any normal man would be excited by this scene. He undressed and stood in the bathtub, letting the warm water from the showerhead wash over him as if to rinse away his fatigue and melancholy.

After bathing, he dried himself and dressed. He did not leave the bathroom immediately but walked to the washing machine where there was a wicker laundry basket.

Li Weijie casually flipped through the basket and found Su Yuyan’s freshly changed underwear lying there, yet to be washed.

Carefully unfolding the crumpled undergarment, he saw a purple lacy thong with black roses embroidered on the transparent fabric.

Li Weijie examined the underwear, noticing a layer of white secretion with a strong scent. It was like a natural aphrodisiac; he inhaled it, and the faint sourness tickled his nose. His body was already highly aroused.

“Is this… Teacher Mother’s scent?”

Li Weijie sniffed Su Yuyan’s underwear and couldn’t resist licking the secretion. He had done this before, but with Lin Yixin.

He gently placed the underwear back and felt a sense of shame towards Su Yuyan, as if he had defiled her.

<><><><><><><><><><><><> Su Yuyan lay on the sofa watching TV. When Li Weijie came out of the bathroom, he saw her sleeping on the sofa with her legs exposed under a black silk nightgown, infinitely alluring.

Li Weijie turned off the TV and walked to Su Yuyan’s side, softly calling: “Teacher Mother, Teacher Mother, go to bed.”

With a bite of his teeth, Li Weijie picked up Su Yuyan. He didn’t notice her eyelashes trembling slightly.

Holding the warm, fragrant Su Yuyan in his arms, Li Weijie’s heart raced. He carried her to the main bedroom and gently placed her on the bed.

Standing straight, Li Weijie looked at Su Yuyan on the bed. First, he saw her crystal-clear body, snow-white and smooth; curves were soft and round; skin was tender and delicate. Her black hair was smooth and fragrant.

Her dreamy, charming face was white and tender; her cherry lips were rosy and full; her cheeks soft and round, neck slightly curved. Her shoulders were slender and rounded like the moon, arms white and soft; her long fingers delicate as jade.

Sleeping Su Yuyan looked like a shy little girl, but Li Weijie knew she was not. No little girl had such full breasts.

Her two peaks were like ripe peaches, teasing Li Weijie’s senses.

Long legs peeked out from the hem of her nightgown, which only reached her knees. He saw black lace at the end.

“Is her underwear also black?”

Li Weijie’s thoughts raced as he decided to uncover the mystery. He glanced around like a thief.

No one could describe Li Weijie better than “bold as brass.” When he lifted Su Yuyan’s nightgown, he found his guess was wrong.

Because the mystery revealed that Su Yuyan, elegant and refined teacher mother, wore no underwear at all.

Taking a deep breath, Li Weijie calmed himself and helped Su Yuyan take off her slippers before gently covering her with a blanket.

After tucking the blankets, he quietly watched Su Yuyan’s sweet sleeping posture. After a long while, Li Weijie sighed: “Teacher Mother is truly beautiful.”

Turning to leave the room, he said softly as he stood at the door: “Teacher Mother, goodnight.”

Li Weijie turned off the light and quietly closed the door.

Not long after Li Weijie left, Su Yuyan suddenly opened her eyes. She quietly propped herself up and secretly watched the door, moving her lips but not making a sound.

Su Yuyan quickly closed her mouth and lay back, pulling the blanket over her head as if she were a ball.

**Chapter 008: Breakthrough**

The next morning, the sun rose in the east.

Li Weijie did not sleep well last night; his mind was filled with Lin Yixin’s beautiful body. He dreamed of their first time, making love passionately in his dream.

Li Weijie’s hand held Lin Yixin’s face and kissed her red lips.

This kiss was long, as if time and space had stopped, leaving only them in the world.

Lin Yixin’s kiss was unfamiliar; Li Weijie teased her with his tongue, and she slowly opened her mouth to respond.

His hands slowly moved to Lin Yixin’s back, untying the bindings on her chest and taking off her top. He carried her into her bedroom.

His kiss slowly moved from Lin Yixin’s cherry lips to her snow-white neck, gradually moving down.

Finally, Li Weijie gently kissed her high and full breasts. Lin Yixin moaned softly: “Weijie, kiss me, I want you…”

At this moment, Li Weijie’s hand moved to Lin Yixin’s lower body. She was already wet under her jeans, and he slowly inserted himself, feeling the sacred membrane.

He softly said to Lin Yixin: “Don’t be afraid; I’ll be gentle.”

Lin Yixin nodded firmly and said, “I’m not afraid. Come in.”

With Lin Yixin’s consent, Li Weijie slowly entered her body.

“Ah… Weijie… it hurts…”

As Li Weijie’s penis entered, Lin Yixin felt a tearing pain.

Li Weijie held her full breasts and caressed them to ease the pain. Gradually, more fluid flowed from within.

“O… Ah… Oh… Yiyi… Um…”

Lin Yixin finally reached her first climax, flying in the clouds of passion. Her body trembled violently as she moaned.

Seeing this, Li Weijie increased his movements and thrusts.

But when the final climax came, he found Lin Yixin had suddenly turned into Su Yuyan…

Hesitating for a moment, Li Weijie gently opened the door. Su Yuyan was curled up on the bed, her hair spread over her smooth white shoulders. Because she hadn’t moved, it looked like a bundle of fine black wires in the light.

Su Yuyan’s face was still pale and smooth, but it had a faint pink hue like her shoulders.

Li Weijie couldn’t help swallowing saliva, moistening his burning throat. He glanced at Su Yuyan’s body on the sofa and began yesterday’s fantasy in the bathroom.

Her black nightgown was slightly revealing, showing her small navel and curving waist. Her buttocks and thighs formed a graceful curve.

Between her legs, the fabric was sparse and weak, with brown and white blending smoothly. Her chest was naturally firm without a bra.

Li Weijie quietly retreated, closing the door behind him.

In the bathroom, Li Weijie almost heard his heart pounding and blood flowing. He dug through a basket of dirty clothes to find Su Yuyan’s purple, narrow lace underwear.

Looking at the fabric that had covered her most private parts, Li Weijie was ecstatic. He squeezed it like petals in his rough hands, and his eyes welled up with shame under the light. His lips opened and closed as he panted, his legs trembling with pleasure.

He placed the underwear under his nose, closed his eyes and sniffed wildly. His tongue poked out tiredly, tasting the sweet-sour scent of her body.

He undressed and placed the underwear between his legs, feeling its softness against his desire. He released white fluid on the clean tiles…

<><><><><><><><><><><><> Time passed, and seven days went by.

“Bang bang bang…”

A storm of knocking woke up sleeping Li Weijie. The sturdy wooden door seemed like a small boat in the sea under the forceful knocks.

‘Damn it, who’s knocking on my door so early in the morning? ’ Li Weijie cursed. He had played CS until three o’clock last night and was now exhausted, pulling the blanket over his head to ignore the person outside.

It couldn’t be Su Yuyan knocking like this; who was it? He didn’t care, Li Weijie just wanted to sleep.

“Open the door, open it quickly. Weijie, you’re not dead, say something…”

With each knock came the voice of his college roommate Ma Kai.

‘What’s he doing here today? ’ Although Li Weijie didn’t want to get up, he still dragged himself out of bed and opened the door for him.

Li Weijie opened his sleepy eyes and mumbled: “Don’t you have to accompany your girlfriend ‘s’?”

“Damn! You forgot, there’s a job fair at school today. Our company is going too; that’s why I came to find you…”

As he spoke, Ma Kai walked in without hesitation.

“Why are you like this?” Li Weijie asked impatiently: “Believe me, I’ll beat you up…”

Facts speak louder than words. Ma Kai pulled the staggering Li Weijie to a mirror in Lin Yixin’s dressing area.

Li Weijie stood before the mirror, his face turning pale. He almost didn’t recognize himself: messy hair like a bird’s nest, bearded cheeks and chin, dull eyes as if he had been ill.

Speechless, tears flowed.

A week after Lin Yixin left, Li Weijie looked like he was ten years older.

After returning from Su Yuyan’s house, heartbroken and not wanting to see anyone, Li Weijie hadn’t left his room. He stayed home, playing games day and night, eating instant noodles when hungry, sleeping only after his eyes were too tired to open.

Only this way could he forget his sadness. In the past week, he slept for no more than four hours a day.

“Weijie, what’s wrong with you?”

Seeing Li Weijie cry, Ma Kai panicked and asked: “Where is Yixin? She’s not here to take care of you…”

Li Weijie wiped his tears calmly and said indifferently: “We broke up. She’s with Liu Bin.”

“What?”

Ma Kai looked surprised and shouted, “She left with that scoundrel Liu Bin? Tell me, did you do something to hurt her…”

Ma Kai’s words made Li Weijie recall Lin Yixin’s departure. His eyes flashed with madness as he shouted: “I didn’t.”

He punched the dressing table hard, causing it to crack with a loud bang. Fine cracks spread out like spider webs.

Clearly startled by Li Weijie’s roar, Ma Kai stepped back and looked at him in surprise. He never thought his usually gentle friend could be so fierce, even when fighting.

“Alright, alright. I was wrong.”

Ma Kai coughed and quickly changed the subject: “Hurry up and get ready. The job fair starts at ten, it’s already nine.”

Li Weijie felt an inexplicable irritation. He said impatiently: “I don’t want to go, I don’t want to go anywhere…”

Ma Kai opened his mouth as if to say something but then sighed and said softly: “Alright, the job fair lasts three days, it’s not a big deal if you miss today. Actually, if you want to…”

Li Weijie shook his head firmly. Ma Kai shrugged and accepted the somewhat disappointed but understandable result.

Ma Kai’s father owned a large company, and with his help as the heir, getting a decent job wasn’t difficult. But Li Weijie refused.

When Li Weijie came to his senses, Ma Kai had already left.

Entering the bathroom and coming out again, Li Weijie looked completely different.

Standing at 1.80 meters tall with a handsome, chiseled face and deep black eyes, his muscles were strong and powerful. His abdomen had six clearly defined abs in an inverted triangle shape, with long legs full of explosive and destructive energy.

Seeing the shattered dressing table, Li Weijie knew that his martial arts manual “Punching Classic” had broken through its bottleneck and reached the second level.

---

**Chapter 010: Drunkenness**

After eating half a pound of spicy noodles at a noodle shop, Li Weijie walked aimlessly through the bustling streets. Watching people rush home after work made him feel a sour taste in his heart.

As the sun set and the moon rose, from day to night.

The nightlife was bustling under colorful neon lights, with many people lingering and spending their lonely nights.

Li Weijie wandered aimlessly down the long street, perhaps hoping that the noise could temporarily alleviate his emptiness. But the surrounding joy had no effect on him.

He walked as if in another space, feeling nothing of the merriment around him.

Wandering aimlessly on the street, he didn’t even notice when it got dark.

Until a familiar feeling welled up in his heart, Li Weijie suddenly realized he had unknowingly returned to the school gate.
