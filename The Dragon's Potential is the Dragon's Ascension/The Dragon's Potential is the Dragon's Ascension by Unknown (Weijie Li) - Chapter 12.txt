In fact, it was not that Shen Mocong had any resistance towards Li Weijie; rather, due to some shy-to-mention matters, she had no choice but to leave quickly, otherwise the embarrassment would not just be Li Weijie’s.

Shen Mocong sat on the toilet in the innermost bathroom, her small hands impatiently caressing her high chest. Underneath the thin fabric of her long dress, two signs of hard and rosy nipples were clearly visible.

And she was obviously not satisfied with this superficial touch. One could see her delicate hand slipping under the hem of her dress, disappearing into that mysterious space between her legs, creating a beautiful and alluring picture of self-pleasure.

Although sitting alone in the quiet place was somewhat dull, there were obvious benefits. That is to say, one could quietly watch the beauty without worrying about being discovered.

An Bilu, Song Susiang, and Xu Qing were clearly a small group. The three women stood together, surrounded by a crowd of men who thought themselves to be charming and elegant, but their eyes were filled with the desire to devour them, betraying their base natures.

An Bilu was nearly thirty years old, with an attractive appearance and a captivating charm. Song Susiang was a seductive young wife, full-figured and alluring, her eyes always filled with water, captivating the soul. She wore a long dress, with high and plump breasts, and her legs were wrapped in crystal-transparent silk stockings, truly irresistible to men.

The Mulan Club was filled with beautiful women! Li Weijie silently appraised, finding Xu Qing’s appearance already stunning. Moreover, she had been groped and peeped at by Li Weijie before, yet now, dressed up even more dazzlingly, he couldn’t help but glance at her curvaceous figure twice. Unluckily for him, she caught his gaze and glared at him fiercely.

Li Weijie’s heart skipped a beat. Goodness, this woman’s intuition was too sharp! He quickly turned away from the awkward gaze, and Xu Qing noticed Li Weijie’s unnatural expression. She was quite pleased with herself and couldn’t help but giggle, then she puffed out her chest and stuck out her tongue to lick her red lips, presenting an enticing and alluring posture that made Li Weijie’s heart race.

"Li Wei, why are you alone here? Come and have a drink with me."

The beautiful young wife Qin Keqing had her arm draped over his shoulder, and her pretty face grew larger in his eyes. The bright eyes were filled with a smile that could be seen clearly.

"Come, let’s clink our glasses."

Qin Keqing said with a flirtatious smile and raised her glass towards Li Weijie. Then, she sighed with a look of melancholy, sipping the wine in one go.

Li Weijie snatched Qin Keqing’s glass and said worriedly, "Aunt Song, don’t drink anymore. You’re drunk..."

"Who are you calling Aunt? My name is Qin Keqing, others call me Mrs. Song, and Miss Shen likes to call me Aunt because my husband’s surname is Song. Well, let’s not talk about that rascal Song Siming... Hmph..."

Hearing Li Weijie call her Aunt, just like Shen Mocong did, Qin Keqing frowned and said with a reproachful tone, "Li Wei, I prefer you to call me Sister. When no one is around, just call me Sister, okay?"

It seemed that Qin Keqing was truly drunk. She spoke so boldly and without restraint. Li Weijie carefully observed the beautiful woman beside him; her beauty was outstanding, with full breasts and a skirt that seemed to be about to slip off. Even wearing a bra couldn’t hide the undulating beauty of her figure, and despite being close to forty years old, she still maintained a curvaceous shape. Her plump and sexy figure was even more captivating with her delicate, melancholic eyes that made one feel pity for her.

Li Weijie recalled what Ximen Qing from *The Golden Lotus* had said: there are two types of women in the world, those men want to rape and those who want to rape men.

His husband Song Siming was truly fortunate! Song Siming? He had heard this name somewhere, but Li Weijie couldn’t recall where. It just seemed familiar.

"Did you fancy those foxes over there?"

Qin Keqing’s chin rested on Li Weijie’s shoulder, and a fragrant breeze blew into his ears. Already half-drunk Li Weijie felt slightly tipsy, and he turned to look at her small red lips, feeling an urge to kiss them.

Seeing Li Weijie’s hesitant look, Qin Keqing rolled her eyes and said, "Don’t deny it. You’ve been staring at those three foxes for nearly ten minutes now, your eyes are about to pop out."

So she was timing him! Li Weijie conceded and nodded, asking with a sly smile, "Sister, who are they?"

"Xu Qing is the one in the black dress. She’s a sly fox and the head of the central bank, newly appointed with formidable means. I bet you won’t stand a chance against her."

Qin Keqing’s beautiful eyes rolled playfully, and she pursed her lips. "The one in the white dress is Song Susiang, the director of the city’s cultural troupe. Her husband is a chief of staff at the Shu Capital Military Region, and there’s talk that his position might be elevated soon. An Bilu is the deputy director of Dalian City Television, she divorced three years ago and is now single. There are quite a few suitors after her..."

None of these women were easy to deal with! Li Weijie felt a chill thinking about his previous idea of bedding all three women. However, Qin Keqing seemed to know them well, indicating her high status. A woman called "Aunt" by Shen Mocong couldn’t be of low rank, could she?

Li Weijie smelled a sweet fragrance from his nose and felt the smoothness of Qin Keqing’s body. She had leaned most of her body against his arm, and the two round and firm breasts were pressing lightly on his arm.

Since their position was relatively secluded, there shouldn’t be many people coming over. Otherwise, Qin Keqing wouldn’t dare to act so boldly; after all, she was a woman of status. If any scandal were to break out, it would be disastrous.

The two chatted idly, and before they knew it, both had consumed quite a bit of wine.

Although red wine wasn’t as potent as white wine, its initial taste was delightful. But once a certain amount had been consumed, the aftertaste would kick in.

Li Weijie looked at Qin Keqing’s body leaning completely against him and couldn’t help but chuckle. He hadn’t intended any mischief; it was Qin Keqing who had drunk herself into a stupor.

This beautiful woman, once drunk, couldn’t just be left there! Li Weijie thought and decided to carry her to the guest room. The Mulan Club, being a high-end place, naturally had rooms for guests to rest.

"You rascal Song Siming, why do you want her and not me? Do you know how heartbroken I am?"

Just as Li Weijie was about to support Qin Keqing, she started speaking in her drunken state. "Wah wah wah... Why am I so unlucky? Song Siming, you shameless old man, finding a fox not much older than your daughter..."

"..."

Feeling someone holding her, Qin Keqing cried and slapped Li Weijie’s chest, whispering with tears, "Dead rascal, why are you so heartless? Guo Hailang, you sly fox, I won’t let you off..."

What a scene! It seemed that Qin Keqing mistook Li Weijie for her husband Song Siming. Well, let her vent; this beautiful woman looked pitiful.

Li Weijie held Qin Keqing’s slender waist with one hand and her arm over his shoulder with the other. Her soft body emitted a faint heat and fragrance, feeling quite pleasant.

After asking the waiter about the guest rooms, Li Weijie half-carried and half-supported Qin Keqing into a room.

As soon as they entered, Li Weijie’s lustful eyes fell on Qin Keqing. The women in cheongsams tonight were many, but only she wore one so seductively.

Qin Keqing’s exquisite cheongsam accentuated her curvaceous figure, with long and fair legs partially exposed. She wore a pair of small black high-heeled shoes that made her look elegant and sexy.

Li Weijie’s hands trembled as he slowly unbuttoned the first button of her cheongsam, revealing a glimpse of her shoulder blades. The second button revealed the snow-white skin on her chest and the deep cleavage.

Li Weijie couldn’t help but lick his lips, feeling a surge of desire. He didn’t continue to undress her; instead, he kissed her perfect face, the smooth and moist neck, and the snow-white skin on her chest.

Mature women’s skin was soft, tender, and fragrant. It almost made Li Weijie lose control as he kissed her passionately.

After a while, Li Weijie took a deep breath. Qin Keqing’s face was flushed from his intense kisses, her cheeks rosy and luscious.

Drunk people were usually more sensitive. Qin Keqing’s originally flawless skin now had a faint blush, looking even more delicate and luscious.

Li Weijie looked at the enticing Qin Keqing, feeling excited. He trembled as he began to unbutton her cheongsam. With each button undone, the full and high breasts were revealed, covered by a purple bra that was elegant and sexy.

He tightly held Qin Keqing in his arms, their bodies touching. He kissed her cherry-like lips passionately.

His chest pressed against her high breasts, gently rubbing them and feeling the changes in her nipples.

Qin Keqing’s body became softer and warmer, with a blush on her snow-white skin.

Li Weijie gently caressed her smooth and fair back with one hand, while the other trembled as it reached for the sacred peaks. He felt that he could only grasp half of her breasts, and the sensation was so delightful it made him want to stop.

The beautiful woman in his arms began to moan softly, “Ah... Oh...” which further stimulated Li Weijie.

After a while of wild kissing, Li Weijie took a breath. Her sweet and fragrant mouth was so delightful.

The only drawback was that due to the alcohol, Qin Keqing seemed passive. Her pink tongue couldn’t actively seek pleasure, but if she hadn’t drunk the wine, he might not have had this opportunity. Who knew what would happen in the future?

He lowered his head and deeply inhaled, her breasts’ fragrance was faint yet sweet. The full and high peaks were very stimulating to the eyes, especially for someone like Li Weijie who was so close.

It was his first time seeing a mature woman’s breasts up close. Although he had seen them on pornographic websites, the real thing was much more visually stimulating.

He gently kissed her soft breasts and felt he was about to be intoxicated by the passion. His mouth kept kissing her perfect peaks, while his other hand continued to caress the un-kissed breast.

“Ah... Don’t... It’s so hard...”

The beautiful woman in his arms suddenly moaned, and Li Weijie looked up at her flushed face. She was talking in her sleep, he thought with a chuckle.

After covering Qin Keqing’s high breasts with his kisses, Li Weijie turned her over and completely undressed her. Her legs were covered in silky stockings, and her thighs were round and long.

Qin Keqing wore a purple lace thong that was not as revealing as a G-string but still barely covered her half-moon shaped buttocks. There were damp spots on the thong.

Li Weijie couldn’t resist this sensual stimulation and leaned close to her legs. He looked at the sexy thong and the damp spots, then parted her legs and kissed them passionately. One hand caressed her round buttocks while the other roamed over her perfect legs.

The most sensitive parts of a woman were usually their breasts and private areas. The sensitivity in the latter was much greater than that of the former. A woman, whether by a man or even another woman’s touch, would react sexually to her private area. Qin Keqing was a mature and sensitive woman; she was very responsive.

Due to the alcohol, her body became even more sensitive. As Li Weijie kissed her, she began to secrete liquid from her private area.

He kissed the thong-covered area for a while, and it became completely wet with her juices and his saliva.

The taste of her secretions was faint yet sweet, not exactly sweet or fragrant but very stimulating. He swallowed it as if drinking nectar.

He slowly pulled off her thong, revealing a pink and black area with damp spots. A faint scent was noticeable.

Looking at her perfect body, Li Weijie suppressed his urge to make love on the living room sofa and carried her to the bedroom.

He turned on the dim light in the bedroom, creating a warm and intimate atmosphere. Under the soft lighting, Qin Keqing lay on the bed in a languid pose.

Li Weijie stared at her perfect body, feeling mesmerized. It was too perfect and enticing; this was the naked form of a mature woman!

Time was running out, so Li Weijie didn’t hesitate and lay on top of her, pressing her down. Her body was warm, soft, and curvaceous.

Although the drunk Qin Keqing couldn’t initiate anything, just looking at her beautiful body made Li Weijie very excited. He didn’t need more words or physical stimulation.

Experienced in lovemaking, Li Weijie gently caressed her body. Drunk and sensitive, she moaned softly with each touch.

He smiled as he knew she was aroused. He gently caressed her flat stomach and then moved to the fragrant area between her legs, feeling soft, warm, and slippery.

Her thighs and buttocks were covered in sweet nectar. She wrapped her legs around his waist, murmuring, “Yes... Quickly...”

Li Weijie couldn’t hold back any longer. He roared and thrust his member into her moist, fragrant area.

“Ahh...”

A heavenly moan echoed. Qin Keqing was a mature and seductive woman, so Li Weijie didn’t have to worry about anything else. He thrust vigorously, and the intense pleasure coursed through their connected bodies.

He looked at Qin Keqing’s drunk and tender expression, feeling his blood boil. He held her full and round buttocks with both hands, thrusting into the moist area between her legs.

He pushed against her full and round buttocks with force, and she panted heavily, moaning loudly. Her eyes were filled with desire, her lips slightly parted, and she exhaled softly.

Her arms wrapped around his waist, her ten slender fingers gripping his strong buttocks. Her lower body moved upward to meet him, and the protruding part of her body collided with his pelvis, tightly entwining their bodies.

Her soft inner walls contracted intensely, squeezing his thick member slightly.

Seeing her beautiful eyes filled with desire and the continuous waves of pleasure, she began to pant heavily.

He covered her soft lips with his mouth, and she immediately extended her sweet tongue to entangle with his.

He greedily sucked on her warm saliva, and she swallowed his as well. Their bodies were tightly entwined, making it hard to distinguish whose was which.

“Ahh... Ahh...”

Her cheeks flushed with a rosy hue, and she panted heavily as her hips moved up and down.

His member’s head pressed against the depths of her uterus, feeling a soft nub in her core that rubbed against his head as she moved. The intense pleasure spread through his body.

Suddenly, blood rushed to his brain, and he felt goosebumps all over.

At the same time, warm liquid continuously flowed from her core, making his member feel warm and soft like a sponge. Her inner walls moved rhythmically, squeezing his entire length.

He thrust into her wet and tight area, feeling the soft inner walls sucking on him. Her climax continued as she looked at him with sparkling eyes.

He held her full and white breasts, sucking on the slightly red nipples. Her nipples hardened under his warm tongue.

She instinctively moved her hips to meet his thrusts, and the soft inner walls sucked on him like a mouth.

Suddenly, he felt her slender fingers tightly gripping his buttocks, making their bodies completely connected. Her protruding hips rubbed against his pelvis as he thrust into her, making his member even thicker.

“Ahh...”

Qin Keqing’s moans were soft and sweet, her eyes filled with desire. His tongue was entangled with hers.

Her inner area felt like fire, and warm liquid flowed from her core onto his member. Her thighs trembled as she contracted intensely, making it seem like they were completely merged.

The wet and tight inner walls sucked on his member, sending waves of pleasure to his brain. He couldn’t hold back any longer and released a thick stream into her core, making her moan again.

“Ahh...”

Li Weijie roared as he released his essence into her, and Qin Keqing, who had climaxed three times already, was sent to the peak again by his powerful thrusts.

He caressed her soft buttocks and thought that she seemed to have been a while without sex. She had moved so passionately, her seductive and alluring demeanor unlike the elegant lady he saw in the hall.

Even during such intense lovemaking, Qin Keqing showed no signs of waking up. Li Weijie took a breath and went to the bathroom for a towel, wiping her body while muttering, “She’s so wet. This mature woman really has a lot of water. Did all the wine come out from there?”

After finishing, Li Weijie lay down on the bed, tiredly hugging Qin Keqing who was sleeping peacefully. As he laid his head on the pillow, a sound of music rang out; his phone was ringing.

Feeling like he had been caught in bed, Li Weijie jumped up and quickly grabbed his phone. He took a deep breath and answered calmly, “Hello, Minister Shen? Oh! Aunt Qin is drunk. I just brought her to the guest room. What? No need, no need. You don’t have to come over. She’s already asleep. Okay, I’ll be right there.”

Looking at the sleeping Qin Keqing on the bed, her full and white breasts rose gently. Due to lying sideways, a deep cleavage was naturally formed between her peaks, highlighting the elasticity of her breasts. Although not called a "wave," they were still impressive.

Her slender waist and protruding buttocks formed a perfect “S” shape, with full breasts, sexy buttocks, and long legs. It was truly stunning.

The purple bra and thong, along with the thin silk stockings, were torn during their wild encounter, creating a sensual and alluring scene.

Li Weijie looked at her with reluctance before quickly dressing. He walked back to the bed, picked up his phone, and took several photos of her naked body, even some close-ups of her breasts and private area.

He wasn’t taking photos to cause a scandal or threaten anyone; he just wanted to keep some memories in case they had another chance. Of course, there was also a part of his male nature at play; as a small white-collar worker, he didn’t often have the chance to interact with such an elegant and beautiful woman like Qin Keqing.

After tidying up in the bathroom, he left the guest room and headed towards the auction hall as instructed by Shen Mocong.

No matter why Shen Mocong brought him to this auction, Li Weijie felt it was worth it just for the chance to make love with Qin Keqing, a mature and beautiful woman who was elegant in public but passionate in bed.

Looking at the wide windows beside him, he saw dark clouds gathering in the sky. Sure enough, fine raindrops began to fall. It was a light drizzle that often lasted all day.

Li Weijie looked away and quickened his pace, walking towards Shen Mocong who was constantly checking her watch.

When Li Weijie and Shen Mocong were led by a club staff member into the second-floor small auction hall, it was already filled with members. Only a few seats at the back were empty, indicating that this internal club auction attracted many participants.

After satisfying basic needs, people seek more. Those who could afford to enter the club were wealthy and influential; auctions were secondary, but a place for reasonable gatherings was important.

Shen Mocong sat next to Li Weijie in the back row and said, “I have a good friend who just returned from America. She’s having her birthday next week. I heard she recently became fond of Tang Sancai. These past few days, I’ve been looking around but haven’t found anything suitable. They say there’s a rare piece being auctioned today.”

Tang Sancai? Li Weijie was startled and waved his hand, “Don’t give it to her. Don’t give it to her.”

Shen Mocong was curious, “Why? I think that little girl looks pretty?”

“It’s not about whether she looks good or not. Tang Sancai shouldn’t be given casually.”

Li Weijie thought, luckily he knew a bit; otherwise, he might have offended someone. “In the old TV series *Dream of Red Mansions*, there was a Tang Sancai in Grandma Jia’s room. Actually, that’s an error; it’s like a bug. In the Qing Dynasty, no one would put Tang Sancai in their home because it was a burial object for the dead. It’s considered unlucky, just like not giving a clock as a birthday gift.”

In China, Beijing people are the most particular about such things. For example, in a quadrangle courtyard, they wouldn’t plant mulberry or locust trees because the word for mulberry sounds like "loss" and is considered unlucky. Locusts are called “hanging ghosts” in the vernacular, and people wouldn’t want to say "Why does this family have so many hanging ghosts?"

“Burial object? That little girl really likes these strange things.”

Shen Mocong frowned and then smiled, “You know a lot. It’s good you’re here.”

Li Weijie chuckled and asked, “Minister Shen, we...”

Shen Mocong interrupted him with a hint of displeasure, “Minister Shen? Minister Shen... Do you think my name isn’t nice?”

“Everyone says to call me by my name when no one is around.”

There are people everywhere here! Li Weijie looked a bit embarrassed and asked, “Shen... cough, Mocong, I...”

Shen Mocong glared at Li Weijie and said, “From now on, call me by my name when no one is around. Otherwise, I’ll be upset.”

“Okay, okay.”

Li Weijie quickly agreed and then asked, “Mocong, we came here to investigate tonight?”

Shen Mocong laughed and said, “Investigate the Mulan Club’s investment project? It’s not that. They don’t want to make a fuss. You know, in China, even the slightest hint of news can cause a stir. Real estate, stocks, futures... including those Shanxi coal bosses who recently got into garlic.”

Li Weijie nodded, knowing Shen Mocong was right. He originally thought there might be something fishy with the loan, but now he realized they had considered all possibilities.

The auctioneer was a seductive woman with curved eyes, red lips, and a full figure. She exuded mature charm in her coffee-colored business attire, with her legs tightly wrapped in sheer stockings. Many men were secretly watching her, while the young women beside them pouted.

Li Weijie smiled and said, “No wonder it’s a top club! Not just the auctioneer but even those two girls bringing the items are beauties!”

Shen Mocong huffed and said, “Men! Always looking at women’s appearances. You’re all perverts.”

“Not really. Liking beautiful women doesn’t mean you’re a pervert. Everyone loves beauty, right? Besides, what else would men look at if not women? Men looking at other men might be even more perverted. Recently, stars seem to like revealing their same-sex love. Take Zhang Guorong for example; everyone knows he’s gay, and the media never stops following him. He even wore long hair and makeup for his music videos and movies. So, he’s the only great gay man. But Huang Xiaoming also claims to be gay, which is quite surprising since he’s in a relationship with Angelababy. They’ve been spotted together, yet he says he’s gay…”

Li Weijie looked up to the sky and said with a smile, then brought up an ambiguous topic that made Shen Mocong’s face turn red. He grinned and said, “I’m a modern good man, heh! But with you by my side, Mocong, I don’t need to look at other girls. Your beauty is like the moon compared to stars; you’re electricity, light, and my eternal faith…”

“Sweet talker, smooth-talker.”

Shen Mocong pouted and looked at Li Weijie’s not-so-handsome face. Her eyes seemed to blur, and she thought, “So much like him, so much alike. Even his tone of voice is the same. Could it be that heaven took pity on my longing for him and placed this person who looks so much like him by my side, to develop a new relationship and forget the past? No, it’s impossible. He left, forever gone…”

Li Weijie noticed Shen Mocong staring at him and felt a bit embarrassed. He turned his head to look at the intense bidding in front, but suddenly his face changed as he almost couldn’t believe what he saw. He rubbed his eyes a few times and looked again, confirming it was Liu Bin who had taken Lin Yixin away from him.

Beside Liu Bin sat a woman, her waist held by his arm as she clung to him.

The woman was dressed seductively, in a tight white shirt that pushed up her full breasts, revealing the cleavage and lace of her red bra. Her short skirt hugged her buttocks tightly, almost exposing the edges of her stockings. Although only seeing from behind, Li Weijie was sure it wasn’t Lin Yixin.

Liu Bin seemed to have won an item, and the woman kissed him passionately, her full breasts pressing against his arm. They stood up and left through a side door.

Shen Mocong noticed Li Weijie’s expression change, his eyes fixed on the front. She followed his gaze and saw a couple-like pair leaving through the side door.

Li Weijie’s face darkened, and Shen Mocong guessed something. She asked cautiously, “Do you know them?”

Li Weijie nodded heavily and Shen Mocong said, “Them?”

“Don’t say anything.”

Li Weijie growled softly but quickly realized his outburst. He said, “Sorry, my girlfriend left me and ran off with that man…”

Seeing the couple’s intimate gestures made Li Weijie’s anger rise, and he wanted to confront Liu Bin.

Just as Li Weijie moved, Shen Mocong grabbed his hand and said, “Stay calm. Don’t rush it; there will be a chance to teach them a lesson. The most important thing now is to find that man’s weakness.”

Li Weijie agreed with Shen Mocong and thought about how to deal with Liu Bin.

Shen Mocong looked at Li Weijie and sighed, “Li Wei, you really liked your ex-girlfriend…”

Li Weijie, still angry, asked, “Mocong, what did you say?”

Shen Mocong said with a hint of displeasure, “I didn’t say anything.”

Why was she suddenly upset? Li Weijie looked at her, and Shen Mocong blushed. She said, “What are you looking at? What’s so interesting to look at? Haven’t you seen it before?”

Her tone was not friendly, but her face turned even redder. What was she thinking? Why did she look so girlish! Haha, her blushing face looked beautiful.

Feeling uncomfortable under Li Weijie’s gaze, Shen Mocong took three deep breaths. Her full breasts rose and fell, creating a seductive wave before she calmed down.

Five minutes later, Li Weijie couldn’t hold back and said goodbye to Shen Mocong before following.

Outside the auction hall, Li Weijie found a waiter and described Liu Bin’s appearance. Soon he learned that they were in room 1024.

Outside room 1024, through the wooden door, faint sounds of kissing and clothes rubbing could be heard. Li Weijie knew he was in the right place.

Li Weijie didn’t break down the door and, after calming down, left the auction hall. Shen Mocong wouldn’t let Li Weijie do something rash.

He opened Qin Keqing’s room door and entered quietly with Shen Mocong.

The guest room was large, and Qin Keqing was drunk and exhausted. Even if Li Weijie made love with her again, she wouldn’t wake up, so he wasn’t worried Shen Mocong would see her naked and alluring form.

Shen Mocong knew this was Qin Keqing’s room, so she wasn’t surprised Li Weijie had a key. Since the owner was asleep, they wouldn’t disturb her and their current actions weren’t something to be discussed openly.

Li Weijie climbed over the balcony between the two rooms, and with Shen Mocong’s pleading eyes, he helped her over as well.

Due to the two of them, Li Weijie didn’t enter the room and used his phone’s camera mode. Although not the latest model, it had basic photo and video functions.

Looking at the screen, wow! Heavenly! How alluring and stimulating! The woman was sitting on a table with her legs spread at 60 degrees, Liu Bin standing between them, kissing her ear while his left hand was inside her clothes massaging her full breasts and right hand in her thong.

This woman, Wang Xiaoyan, was Liu Bin’s administrative secretary and a recent graduate from an art school. She had been working for three weeks, and with Liu Bin’s coaxing and persuasion, she quickly fell into his embrace.

Wang Xiaoyan moaned, “Ah... Bin... Be gentler. Don’t squeeze so hard... It hurts…”

Liu Bin leered, “Hurt? You mean it feels good. Look how wet you are…”

Liu Bin pulled his fingers out, glistening with moisture, and inserted them into Wang Xiaoyan’s mouth. “Lick it clean.”
