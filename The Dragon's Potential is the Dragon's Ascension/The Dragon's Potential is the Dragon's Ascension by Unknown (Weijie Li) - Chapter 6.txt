Su Yuya sipped elegantly a small mouthful of water, her eyes inadvertently sweeping over the open couple, and her pretty face flushed instantly, perhaps recalling that night’s ambiguous encounter. Her large eyes widened in surprise, appearing particularly bashful.

The stepmother really acts like a little girl, Li Weijie thought with amusement. His heart warmed up and he forgot his timidity, without any reservations, teasing her curiously: “Are you hot? Do you want to turn up the air conditioning?”

Su Yuya is a very intelligent person, of course she clearly understood Li Weijie’s intentions. She naturally had her own way and suppressed the embarrassment in her heart, scolding: “Weijie, I thought you were an honest person! Didn’t you just want to see me blush? Are you satisfied now?”

Intentionally saying ‘you’ without mentioning her own status, and using the kind of intimate terms used between lovers, Su Yuya was indeed very thoughtful. If Li Weijie did not feel this out…

Feeling the subtle amorous atmosphere from his beloved, playing around with guns in a couple’s restaurant made him feel as if his whole heart was melting.

Chapter 26: Dining Together

Unbeknownst to him, a girl of about eighteen years old walked up to the table. She was a beautiful and fashionable young lady who smiled as she kissed Su Yuya’s face, saying: “Auntie, what are you doing here?”

Su Yuya blushed and introduced her to Li Weijie: “She is my goddaughter, Li Yuqian. She grew up in America and just returned recently.”

“She is my student, Li Weijie,” Su Yuya added.

Su Yuya introduced Li Weijie to Li Yuqian and emphasized that she grew up in America.

Li Weijie and Li Yuqian smiled at each other, shaking hands as a sign of goodwill.

Releasing Li Weijie’s smooth and delicate hand, which seemed even finer than a girl's, Li Yuqian asked teasingly: “Auntie, why are most of your buttons undone?”

Li Yuqian spoke without any intention, but Su Yuya’s face flushed completely. She said awkwardly: “Oh! Maybe it was because of the wind while driving…”

Li Yuqian gently buttoned up Su Yuya’s loose buttons, but her movements were slow and she unintentionally pressed her palm on the full breasts of Su Yuya, making Li Weijie blush and feel nervous.

Su Yuya blushed shyly and said softly: “Yuqian… don’t tease Auntie…”

The actions of Li Yuqian and Su Yuya seemed a bit over the top, giving an unusual sense of intimacy. Li Yuqian’s fair and translucent skin, her oval face, lively eyes, high nose, cherry lips, and long silky hair made her a rare beauty.

Su Yuya blushed and said: “Yuqian, come sit down and eat with us…”

Li Yuqian smiled and said: “No need. I came here with friends, saw Auntie here so I just stopped by to say hello and will be leaving soon.”

Li Yuqian bent slightly, from Li Weijie’s angle, he saw that she was wearing nothing underneath her blouse. No wonder Su Yuya emphasized that she grew up in America, with such a bold style.

Two full white mounds swayed gently on her chest, two tender pink nipples clearly visible. How tempting! Li Weijie thought that the young Li Yuqian had such beautiful breasts.

Li Weijie’s legs swelled up. As Li Yuqian leaned over, she whispered something in his ear before bidding farewell to Su Yuya and left.

“Have you… looked enough?”

Su Yuya blushed shyly, but her tone did not seem very angry.

Li Weijie straightened up and dared not speak, wondering if Su Yuya was scolding or teasing him.

Unbeknownst to him, the second button on Su Yuya’s blouse had loosened for no reason.

Half of a snow-white breast and the enticing pink bra were clearly visible, through the lace on the side. Li Weijie could faintly see the shy pink nipples, his whole body heated up as he knew Su Yuya had successfully captivated him.

Su Yuya’s eyes secretly glanced at Li Weijie’s lower body, seeing that his unmentionable part had risen due to the heat. Su Yuya smiled secretly and suddenly a strong wind blew, revealing the enticing view of her breasts, but the deep cleavage disappeared from Li Weijie’s sight.

“Do you need me to wait for you?”

Su Yuya parked the car, her face flushed and a teasing smile on her lips.

Li Weijie looked around quickly and saw that across the street was a hair salon, with several women in flashy attire soliciting customers.

“I… I…”

Li Weijie’s handsome face turned red, quickly lowering his head to fiddle with his phone. He first checked the time, then the date, and finally the battery level…

Unable to find anything else to do, Li Weijie impulsively sent a text message to Xia Weiwei informing her that he had applied for Tianfeng Group and was already hired after the interview.

Su Yuya smiled secretly, seeing him stammering. She no longer teased him and continued driving.

After a half-hour drive, they arrived at a parking lot. The restaurant’s parking was full, so they had to park in another nearby one and walk over.

Li Weijie noticed that today Su Yuya was dressed fashionably, her carefully made-up face even more stunning. One word: beautiful.

Li Weijie had seen many beauties, but few were as pleasing to the eye as her.

This mature beauty was naturally beautiful and belonged to that rare type of exquisite beauty. Most importantly, her figure was curvaceous yet smooth, not as thin as a young girl’s. The good quality clothes clung to her long and rounded legs, then came the short skirt covering a cute buttocks, making Li Weijie involuntarily think of the protagonist in Korean movies.

Su Yuya was slightly embarrassed by his intense gaze, pretending to comb her hair and said teasingly: “Weijie, we can go now.”

This was the most lethal move. The curvaceous breasts moved gracefully with her actions, making Li Weijie’s strong self-control almost give in.

Li Weijie nodded and the two strolled leisurely along the road. The bustling pedestrians made them stand out.

The woman was graceful and beautiful, the man elegant and refined. Others envied their appearance.

Walking together felt a bit awkward. Couples usually hugged closely, but they walked separately, appearing distant.

Li Weijie was not the first time walking with Su Yuya. Previously they were relaxed and chatting, but now it felt different.

Su Yuya bit her lip, suddenly extending one of her white arms and tightly holding Li Weijie’s arm. His handsome face flushed instantly.

This was a standard couple pose, the stepmother… Li Weijie’s heart pounded wildly.

Unaware of time passing, he arrived at the restaurant entrance like a puppet on strings.

The waiter’s eyes lit up and greeted them courteously: “Sir, please come in. Do you have a reservation?”

This restaurant was considered upscale here; otherwise, the parking would not be full.

Li Weijie felt the delicate touch of Su Yuya while mechanically shaking his head.

The waiter checked the computer and found that a table had just become available, leading them to it.

Before the waiter could ask, Li Weijie politely pulled out a chair for Su Yuya to sit.

As they sat down, the waiter handed them menus and suggested: “We have a new couple’s set meal. Would you like to try it?”

It was no wonder the waiter mistook them for a couple; Li Weijie was tall and handsome, Su Yuya maturely beautiful. Walking together like that made them a perfect pair.

Li Weijie hesitated, Su Yuya smiled coyly and nodded in agreement.

He closed the menu and politely ordered: “Two lemon juices, please.”

He remembered that he liked lemon juice. Su Yuya was touched by his thoughtfulness and smiled gently: “Actually, you don’t have to cater to me. Would you like some red wine?”

Li Weijie smiled casually, his radiant smile making Su Yuya lose herself again.

Everything proceeded smoothly. The atmosphere was infectious; the young couples around them were flirting openly, and in a nearby booth, a couple kissed passionately under dim candlelight.

Su Yuya sipped elegantly a small mouthful of water, her eyes inadvertently sweeping over the open couple, and her pretty face flushed instantly. Her large eyes widened in surprise, appearing particularly bashful.

The stepmother really acts like a little girl, Li Weijie thought with amusement. His heart warmed up and he forgot his timidity, without any reservations, teasing her curiously: “Are you hot? Do you want to turn up the air conditioning?”

Feeling the subtle amorous atmosphere from his beloved, playing around with guns in a couple’s restaurant made him feel as if his whole heart was melting.

Chapter 27: Xu Qing

“Stepmother, you go in. I’ll wait here.”

Li Weijie said to the interested Su Yuya, exhausted from his efforts. After mastering the second level of the Fist Scripture, this was the first time he felt “out of breath.”

“Haha! Since you found a job today and are so obedient, I won’t force you.”

Su Yuya smiled sweetly. “Alright, wait here quietly…”

Li Weijie slumped listlessly beside a bronze statue on the commercial street, watching the bustling crowd.

Now he didn’t even have the mood to look at the exposed beauties. He just leaned his head against the statue behind him, slightly stretching his numb legs when he felt something trip him. A sharp cry rang out as a fragrant breeze swept over.

“Trouble!”

Without thinking, Li Weijie quickly stood up and stretched out his right hand to catch the falling person. In that instant, he felt a soft, warm, and elastic sensation.

Instinctively, Li Weijie squeezed harder. “Ah!”

A mixed cry of anger and embarrassment rang out.

Li Weijie finally saw that he was holding a long-haired woman in a white shirt. Realizing what the soft, firm thing was, he let go of her like an electric shock, and she cried out as she fell.

“Bad!”

Li Weijie knew he had made a serious mistake and quickly reached out again, catching her just before she hit the ground. His fingers slipped between her loose shirt buttons, and that soft, warm sensation returned. This time, he distinctly felt a protruding point roll under his palm.

“Rude guy!”

Xu Qing, surprised by this bold wolf’s second attempt to grope her, angrily slapped Li Weijie. He easily dodged but she fell clumsily to the ground.

“Red, sexy see-through panties!”

Glancing at the woman’s exposed leg as she fell, Li Weijie’s eyes followed down to glimpse the anticipated view.

Feeling his fiery gaze, Xu Qing blushed and gritted her teeth, twisting to stand up.

“Li Weijie, what are you doing?”

Su Yuya walked over and glared at him. Turning to Xu Qing, she asked gently: “Sister, sorry about this. My Li Weijie is a bit naughty. What did he do wrong? Let me make it up to you…”

Xu Qing was around thirty, similar in age to Su Yuya. Yet she called her sister and referred to Li Weijie as “my Li Weijie.”

But indeed, Xu Qing was very pretty. She had the mature charm of a woman in her prime, with black silky hair cascading over her shoulders. Her oval face was well-defined, and her lively eyes sparkled with allure; her full red lips exuded charm. Her slender neck, prominent collarbone, and round shoulders were covered in smooth, white skin that glowed with a hint of fragrance. Her slender waist was like willow branches, and her legs were as smooth as ivory; her delicate fingers were soft and boneless. Her beautiful, long legs under the skirt swayed gracefully with every move.

Su Yuya gently helped Xu Qing up, stroking her snow-white calves and smiling: “It’s all Li Weijie’s fault. Sister, I’m sorry… Do you need me to take you to the hospital?”

Xu Qing cooperated with Su Yuya’s help, glaring at Li Weijie and smiling at Su Yuya. She said she was fine and didn’t need to go to the hospital, her voice melodious.

Su Yuya supported Xu Qing as they walked forward. Li Weijie followed silently, watching the two beautiful women sway with their plump buttocks.

Li Weijie couldn’t look at Su Yuya and stared intently at Xu Qing. He watched her breasts bounce, his desire rising with each movement. His gaze moved down to her large buttocks, making his member ache.

***

Returning home, Li Weijie found the lights on and the TV playing. Xia Weiwei was asleep on the sofa.

The sound of him opening the door woke Xia Weiwei. She sat up and said: “Weijie, you’re back. Did you eat?”

Seeing her red eyes and dark circles, Li Weijie was moved again, just like when her hand got burned because of him.

He saw the sumptuous meal on the table, knowing she had waited for him to celebrate his new job. She was a silly girl; he should have called her.

Seeing the beautiful woman’s concern, Li Weijie approached and held her hands apologetically: “Weiwei, I’m sorry for being late. Did you worry?”

Xia Weiwei was relieved to see him back, intending to warm up the food but was pulled into her room by Li Weijie.

What would happen next?

Li Weijie covered her with a blanket, sat beside the bed, and gently stroked Xia Weiwei’s face: “Weiwei, sleep well. Dark circles aren’t pretty and are bad for your health.”

“Why do you say I’m old now? Did you just notice or want me to eat and sleep, turning into a fat pig?”

Xia Weiwei, though tired, teased him gently.

“Of course not. My Weiwei is always as beautiful as a fairy.”

“First you say I’m old and ugly, then you call me a fairy. You talk so much.”

“It’s all your teaching, teacher.”

“Go on, you learned from someone. Don’t talk so much.”

“Yes, yes! Sleep now. Get some rest and wake up refreshed. I want to see you beautiful.”

Li Weijie kissed her hand gently, then stood up.

Xia Weiwei watched him leave and lay down, recalling their conversation. She touched the place Li Weijie had stroked and fell asleep.

Chapter 1: Yun Smoke

Monday morning at nine, a slender young man with an elegant appearance walked into the lobby of Yulong Tower.

Li Weijie looked at the beautiful OLs walking around and smiled softly: “Ladies, I’m here.”

Entering the elevator, it was crowded with eight or nine people during office hours. The small space filled with high-end perfume.

In front of him was an OL in a gray suit, her round and uplifted buttocks visible under the narrow skirt. What an exquisite butt!

As they reached the sixteenth floor, several people rushed out, pushing the woman in front of Li Weijie. His hand touched her plump buttocks.

“Haha, my luck is good today!”

Still feeling the softness of her butt, Li Weijie asked at the reception about Manager Left’s office.

“Knock knock!”

Li Weijie knocked on the door.

“Come in!”

A moment later, a haughty voice answered from inside.

Entering, Li Weijie smiled: “Manager Left, hello! I’m here to report.”

“Oh, Xiao Li. Why are you standing? Come in and sit down!”

Left Cheng smiled. As a deputy manager who had fought for seven or eight years, he knew there was something behind Li Weijie’s sudden arrival.

Left Cheng was of medium build, wearing gold-rimmed glasses with small eyes. Li Weijie instinctively disliked him but sat down opposite his desk, given the friendly attitude.

“You should go to the secretary’s office and find Secretary Liu. She will arrange your work.”

Left Cheng didn’t beat around the bush, not putting on a bossy act.

“Okay! Thank you, Manager Left.”

Li Weijie stood up and left.

‘Why do I have to find the secretary for my work?’

Arriving at the secretarial office, Li Weijie saw a group of stylishly dressed girls.

The secretary at the front desk was about twenty years old, pretty.

“Hello, I’m Li Weijie. I’m here to see Secretary Liu.”

Li Weijie was polite, knowing she was a beautiful girl.

“Oh, hello,” the secretary smiled.

“I’m Li Na, Secretary Liu’s personal assistant. Are you new? Why did Manager Left send you to see her?”

“I don’t know, he told me to come here.”

Li Weijie shrugged, curious about a secretary having an assistant.

“Please wait a moment,” Li Na said casually.

“Thank you.”

Li Weijie smiled.

After Li Na informed her, he knocked on the door and entered a spacious office. He was stunned by how beautiful the woman behind the desk was.

She looked around twenty-five or six, with thick black hair tied up. Her oval face had a light makeup, and her slender nose was framed by glasses. Her eyes were bright and exuded an elegant, intellectual beauty.

“Are you Li Weijie?”

The woman asked. “Please sit.”

“Yes, yes…”

Li Weijie finally came to his senses but didn’t sit down.

“I said please sit.”

The woman stood up and extended her hand.

Li Weijie hurried over, shook hands with her, and looked at her face. She was indeed maturely beautiful and alluring.

Her delicate nose, pearl-like teeth, almond-shaped eyes, and cherry lips were complemented by her slender figure. Her fair skin was almost translucent at the neckline, blending with the white collar. The two prominent breasts pushed out her blouse, inviting thoughts and desires. Her tight black dress accentuated her slender waist and rounded buttocks, forming a perfect curve.

“Such soft hands!” Li Weijie didn’t want to let go until she pulled back her hand.

“I’m Yun Smoke, the head of Tianfeng Group’s secretarial department. Please sit.”

Yun Smoke said emotionlessly, but Li Weijie didn’t hear her.

‘Yun Smoke, a beautiful name. Her breasts are so full, probably 35D.’

“Li Weijie, are you listening?”

Yun Smoke sounded slightly annoyed.

“I’m sorry. I was a bit distracted, it’s my first day.”

Li Weijie apologized quickly, knowing she was a strong woman.

Yun Smoke took out a file from her drawer and said without looking up: “I saw your resume. You only have a bachelor’s degree, although I value ability over education. But you have no work experience and your major doesn’t match our company’s requirements…”

“Not bad! You managed to pass the interview. Since you’re here, I’ll try my best to arrange for you. But I’ll keep an eye on you. Don’t make any mistakes, or I’ll fire you immediately.”

“Alright, go out and let Li Na take you to meet your department head,” Yun Smoke said.

Li Weijie stood up, scratched his head and said goodbye before leaving.

“Damn, a strong woman. To stand in Tianfeng Group, I need to deal with her first.”

Following Li Na, he thought about Yun Smoke’s mature and sexy face. He arrived at his department—Credit Investment Department.

***

Chapter 2: Bai Jie

The Credit Investment Department was a large department with several heads. Li Weijie only met one of them.

There were sixty people in the department, including him. The head was a middle-aged woman named Li Jie with a cold expression.

Li Jie greeted him neither warmly nor coldly, showing leadership.

She introduced Li Weijie to everyone: “This is our new colleague, Li Weijie. Welcome.”

She clapped first, followed by a few scattered applause.

Li Weijie bowed and said: “Please give me your guidance!”

Someone chuckled softly, saying: “Hey! You look a bit like a Japanese person.”

Li Weijie looked up and saw Huang Ying, a young girl with a beautiful name.

She wore a white blouse and a short skirt, accentuating her slender figure. Her skin was as smooth as ice, with long legs almost completely exposed under the skirt. She exuded an office lady’s charm.

Her willow-like eyebrows, straight nose, and cherry lips were complemented by her fair neck. Two prominent breasts under a white blouse made her look alluring.

Muttering ‘little demoness,’ Li Weijie smiled awkwardly. Then, Li Jie introduced a team leader to him.

Li Weijie had no specific work on his first day, so he flipped through customer files. He kept thinking about the beautiful woman in the elevator and Yun Smoke’s captivating face.

At the end of the day, Li Weijie left Tianfeng Group without seeing that beautiful woman again.

Standing outside Yulong Tower, Li Weijie didn’t know where to go. He didn’t want to go home yet; Xia Weiwei was still working on her important doctoral thesis and would be late.

“Hey! Where are you going after work?”

A voice came from behind. Li Weijie turned and saw Huang Ying, now in a white skirt and black T-shirt. Her breasts moved gently with her steps, her round buttocks forming a beautiful curve under the short skirt. Her legs were bare and she wore small white sandals.

“Going home, where else? Do you want to invite me?”

Huang Ying huffed and said: “Dream on, with you. Hmph…”

“Xiao demoness, go home then.”

Huang Ying giggled and said: “You should hurry back. Otherwise, your wife might make you kneel on the washing board!”

Li Weijie’s phone rang. Huang Ying laughed and said: “Speak of the devil! I’ll leave, bye!”

“Don’t we have a washing machine?”

Li Weijie called Xia Weiwei to tell her he would be late. It was Ma Kai calling.

“Hey! Where are you?”

Ma Kai asked.

“Just finished work.”

“To celebrate your first day, I’ll treat. How about it?”

“Sure!”

Li Weijie called Xia Weiwei and told her he would be late. She reminded him to take care of himself, drink less alcohol, and come back early.

***

At six PM, Li Weijie met Ma Kai at the Galaxy Dynasty Hotel. According to Ma Kai, his red-haired friend was the hotel’s manager.

They enjoyed a luxurious seafood dinner with shark fin, abalone, and sea cucumbers. Li Weijie had never eaten such an extravagant meal; even the simplest dish was worth half a month’s salary.

After the feast, Li Weijie burped and said: “Kaizi, you’re so lucky to eat here every day.”

Ma Kai smiled: “You can come too. I’ll get Bai Jie to give you a discount.”

“With this consumption, even at 50% off, I can’t afford it!”

Li Weijie shook his head. “I’m saving for my wife.”

Just then, the door opened and Bai Jie appeared, a beautiful woman in her thirties. She was slender with light blue floral dress hugging her curvaceous figure, high breasts, a slim waist, and full buttocks. Her face was like autumn water, her eyes alluring, and her skin flawless.

Ma Kai introduced his red-haired friend: “Manager of Galaxy Dynasty Hotel, Bai Jie.”

“Hello,” Bai Jie said gracefully.

Li Weijie stood up and shook her hand politely, saying: “Hello.”

After dinner, they drove around the city until it was dark. They stopped at Caesar’s Palace.

Caesar’s Palace, located in a prime area with sea views, was one of the largest clubs. It had twenty floors and five floors.

Li Weijie looked at the magnificent building, feeling amazed. He had never imagined he would come to such a luxurious place.

Ma Kai pushed him and said: “Come on, country bumpkin. You look like an old woman in the Grand View Garden.”

The valet parked their car, and Ma Kai tipped him.

This was a members-only club. The guards let them in without showing membership cards.

The first floor looked like any other club, with marble floors and a chandelier. Some young men and women in designer clothes were chatting.

Ma Kai whispered: “Don’t think they are socialites. They are high-class prostitutes, each with a bachelor’s degree or higher, costing five thousand per night.”

On the second floor, two servants opened a carved door. A warm breeze with an unknown perfume greeted them.

Sixteen young women in semi-transparent gowns lined up, bowing as the door opened. Sixteen pairs of breasts and deep cleavages captivated all men.

The room was soundproof. Inside, the noise couldn’t be heard outside.

Ma Kai led Li Weijie to the top floor. A manager greeted them politely: “Young Master Ma, hello. Do you need anything?”

“Is the boss here? I reserved a room.”

“Yes, please follow me,” the manager said.

“Reserving rooms here is hard. If I didn’t know the boss, we wouldn’t have gotten one.”

Li Weijie looked out at the sea and sky. The view was beautiful.

Ma Kai asked: “What do you want to do first?”

“Let’s go get a massage,” Li Weijie said. “I’m tired and need to relax.”

Chapter 3: Tang Guo

Ma Kai introduced his red-haired friend: “Manager of Galaxy Dynasty Hotel, Bai Jie.”

“Hello,” Bai Jie said gracefully.

Li Weijie stood up and shook her hand politely, saying: “Hello.”
