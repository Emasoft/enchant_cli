Li Weijie chuckled and shook his head, not entering the campus but instead turning to enter a nearby high-end nightclub.

Alcohol is not a good thing; it hurts the stomach and clouds the mind, but alcohol was what he craved now, to forget all his worries and pain in a drunken stupor.

After walking for about half an hour, a grand hall adorned with gold and splendor appeared before him.

A lady in a red cheongsam gracefully approached Li Weijie and said, “Sir, would you like to drink, sing, or dance? Do you know any familiar ladies?”

Li Weijie looked at the service ladies in the hall, all of whom were over 175 centimeters tall with model-like figures. Their cheongsams did not have undergarments, and their plump breasts were subtly visible.

Shaking his head, Li Weijie said, “I am here to drink.”

“Sir, this way please.”

The lady deeply bowed and stepped aside.

Li Weijie caught a glimpse of the infinite allure revealed when she bent over, and his Adam’s apple struggled to move.

Taking advantage of the time while the lady fetched him a drink, Li Weijie glanced through the single-paned window at the scene inside the nightclub.

Ear-splitting heavy metal rock music, played by a seductive DJ in revealing attire, pushed the emotions of men and women on the dance floor to one climax after another. The dim laser lights flashed, each person being swept by a single color light, their expressions appearing fierce for an instant.

In the spacious dance floor, hundreds of young men and women in trendy outfits moved their bodies freely to the strong rhythm of the music.

At this moment, everyone had shed their usual pretenses and were releasing their innermost dark sides.

Around the dance floor, sofas formed a ring where men and women sat, whistling, shouting loudly, twisting their buttocks on the sofas, and swaying like snakes, appearing wildly mad.

In the center of the dance floor stood a high platform where a sexy woman with an alluring figure, wearing a black see-through chiffon dress, wildly twisted her slender waist. Her long hair cascaded to her hips and was blown by a large fan, revealing a wild beauty. Her pale skin contrasted with the black see-through chiffon dress, exuding an unusual allure.

Eight steel poles stood straight beside her. Eight women with fair skin but seductive and alluring, wearing only bikinis, moved their bodies, filling the disco with a frenzied atmosphere.

In the rooms, music was loud, beer cups emptied one after another. Li Weijie’s senses and thoughts gradually became dull, the surrounding noise slowly fading away.

Li Weijie seemed to be alone in an empty field, savoring the bitterness and loneliness, his eyes seeing nothing but the beer glass in front of him.

Gradually, Li Weijie’s mind began to blank out. He mechanically raised his glass, drank, and put it down, then raised it again, drank again, and put it down, repeating the cycle as his senses grew increasingly hazy.

Rising to his feet, he opened the door and walked unsteadily. His head was dizzy, Li Weijie, already drunk beyond recognition, headed towards the restroom.

Suddenly, he turned his head and saw a scene in a KTV room beside him.

In this large room that could accommodate dozens of people, two men and two women were狂欢ing.

A seductive woman was wildly playing in the room. They lined up, four people moving wildly to the music.

Smoke kept billowing from around the room, changing lights flashing repeatedly. The four people moved wildly, the seductive woman standing in the middle, frantically shaking her head. Her body bent at ninety degrees, and her upper body moved wildly with her head.

Her face was beautiful, her figure plump. She wore a simple T-shirt and low-rise jeans. As she moved wildly, her plump breasts bounced up and down inside the T-shirt, while the jeans almost slipped off, revealing half of her beautiful buttocks.

A more handsome man approached the seductive woman with a lecherous smile. The other couple saw this and moved to one side, shaking their heads while watching.

The handsome man reached behind the seductive woman and suddenly pulled up her T-shirt. The couple watching cheered.

The seductive woman seemed pleased as well, raising her arms and swaying her ample buttocks. She continuously rubbed against the man behind her.

The man’s eyes glowed with more lecherousness. He licked his dry lips and pulled down the seductive woman’s jeans with force.

The room erupted in even louder cheers. The seductive woman turned around, twisting like a snake, and danced passionately with the handsome man, occasionally sticking out her tongue to kiss his lips.

The man’s desire grew stronger. He embraced the seductive woman and, with force, pulled her to a sofa, pouncing on her like a fierce tiger.

“Actually, I don’t want to leave; actually, I want to stay and spend every spring and autumn with you…”

The phone rang. Li Weijie took it out, barely pressing the接听键, “Hello…”

“Wei Jie, where are you? Why is it so noisy…”

Su Yuya’s slightly anxious voice came through the phone.

“Teacher, Teacher Mother… it’s fine… I’m drinking at a bar… soon, I’ll be back…”

His tongue tied, he mumbled incoherently. Dizzy and disoriented, Li Weijie hung up the phone hurriedly.

Chapter 11: Women’s Restroom

With a face flushed red, Li Weijie walked unsteadily towards the restroom. His steps were like walking on clouds, and he stumbled at the door.

“Why is the floor… so slippery…”

Mumbling incoherently, Li Weijie supported himself and stood up. With blurry eyes, he entered the restroom.

At this moment, Li Weijie made a fatal mistake. When he fell earlier, his direction was reversed. After standing up and moving forward subconsciously, he ended up in the women’s restroom.

Entering the toilet, Li Weijie was puzzled by his alcohol-dulled brain. Where were the urinals?

Straining to open his blurry eyes, Li Weijie looked around for a long time but couldn’t find the familiar stalls. He thought he must have drunk too much and decided to go directly into the nearest single stall.

“Bang,” Li Weijie, without realizing it, easily smashed open a locked stall door with his fist.

“Ah!”

A woman’s terrified scream echoed. She stared at Li Weijie, her mouth wide open as if ready to blow a trumpet for him.

Li Weijie blinked hard, feeling as if his head had been struck by a hammer.

A beautiful woman in her thirties was sitting on the toilet, terrified and calling out. She wore a light pink summer dress with a V-neck revealing smooth skin. Her two prominent breasts, at least 90 centimeters in diameter, were tightly bound by a pink lace bra. Her waist was slender, and her short skirt barely covered her thighs, revealing long, white, and shapely legs. Thin, transparent flesh-colored stockings and black high heels adorned her body, exuding the charm of a mature woman.

At the knees of her legs hung a pink lace thong. From Li Weijie’s angle, he could see the dark pubic hair between her legs.

Li Weijie staggered into the stall, belching and mumbling incoherently: “You… how did you get into the men’s restroom? Hurry up and leave…”

“You, what do you want to do? Ah! I warn you, don’t come over…”

The beautiful woman panicked and cried out, her face pale. She even held back the last few drops of urine.

But halfway through her cry, she suddenly stopped. She was from a state-owned enterprise and held an important position; if too many people were alerted or it made the news, it would be bad for her and her unit’s image.

Just as she hesitated, Li Weijie had already approached. He reached out and roughly pulled the woman’s plump body up.

“No, don’t…”

The beautiful woman trembled in fear. Her naked buttocks left the toilet seat, feeling a cold chill as her pink thong slid down to her feet. Her lower body was now completely exposed.

The drunk man, not knowing his strength, pulled her with too much force. The woman’s curvaceous body fell heavily into his arms.

Feeling the two magnificent breasts pressing against his chest, their smoothness and elasticity stirred Li Weijie’s desire. His lower body began to swell, pressing against the woman’s soft buttocks.

The woman thought he was about to do something improper and her clear eyes filled with fear. The mixture of sweat, alcohol, and urine odor was unbearable.

Li Weijie shook his head and gently pushed her away. He unzipped his pants, aiming at the toilet to relieve himself.

“Ah! Pervert… let me out! You pervert, let me go…”

The woman was both embarrassed and angry. She quickly pulled up her thong to escape, but the door was blocked by Li Weijie’s body. She stomped her feet in frustration.

Despite her cries, the dizzy Li Weijie paid no attention. At that moment, laughter and high heels tapping on marble floors were heard outside.

“Why isn’t Bi Ru coming out…”

The voice was from a colleague. The woman panicked, realizing the situation couldn’t be covered up. If they saw her like this, she wouldn’t have a face to show at work and might even have problems in her marriage.

At this moment, Li Weijie had finished. As he prepared to leave, the door on her side opened inward. The woman grabbed him and pushed him inside, locking the stall again.

Two beautiful women in their thirties entered gracefully. The sound of high heels on the floor was even clearer.

One woman with a captivating figure said, “Bi Ru, are you in there?”

“Suxiang, stop fooling around. Bi Ru is…”

The other woman deliberately stretched her voice: “Today is a heavy day for her, ha ha ha…”

Song Suxiang giggled and tickled her friend: “Xuqing, you flirtatious woman. I think it’s your heavy day.”

“Ha ha ha…”

Xuqing and Song Suxiang laughed loudly in the restroom.

An Ru looked at Li Weijie and whispered, “I… I have stomach pain…”

The two women asked worriedly: “Bi Ru, are you okay?”

“No… I’m fine…”

An Ru swallowed hard and softly said: “I’ll be better soon.”

Suddenly, someone pulled her. Dizzy Li Weijie almost fell as he stumbled.

With the help of a soft body, he stood up straight. He opened his mouth to speak, but a small hand quickly covered it.

An Ru half-hugged Li Weijie. Her slender waist moved, causing her soft and elastic buttocks to rub against his lower body. The junction of the thigh-high stockings with her thighs was soft and elastic, making his heart race.

Due to her sensual body moving in his arms, Li Weijie’s hand accidentally slid onto her plump buttocks.

“Ah! That area is very sensitive. Does he really want to rape me? What if he does?”

Thinking she might be raped by this strong man, An Ru’s body stiffened. Hearing her colleagues’ voices outside, she suddenly collapsed.

Li Weijie looked at the voluptuous woman in his arms. Now their chests were pressed together, her pale cheeks flushed with embarrassment.

Chapter 12: Cloud and Rain

“Ah, he’s pressing against me… hmm, can’t feel anything… if I get wet now, he’ll think I’m a wanton woman. He will rape me…”

When the two colleagues left, An Ru started struggling again. As she moved her legs apart, Li Weijie’s hand on her plump buttocks slid along.

An Ru was flushed and panting, only slightly struggling. She shook her head lightly; her cheek against Li Weijie’s neck was warm and soft.

Li Weijie forgot everything, only knowing he held a sensual woman. An Ru’s slightly open soft mouth exhaled warm breaths, making Li Weijie’s blood rush and his lower body press against her private area.

“Ah! His thing is so hard… oh, it’s so big…”

Both Li Weijie and An Ru were lost in passion. Her shapely buttocks moved shyly, one plump leg unconsciously wrapped around his waist.

Li Weijie felt he could no longer hold back. He unfastened his belt, pulled down the zipper, and tugged off his underwear to his knees.

Li Weijie’s hand on An Ru’s plump buttocks lifted her skirt, rubbing against the thin thong. The sensation was like an electric shock, making her moan and move forward.

“Ah! His thing is so big… oh, it’s so comfortable… my husband doesn’t have one this big… no, I can’t let him win. It would be unfair to my husband…”

“You… don’t do anything… I’m not just any woman… ah…”

An Ru panted, more in teasing than resistance.

Li Weijie didn’t care if she was just any woman. He forcefully pulled open her narrow pink thong, lowered the toilet seat cover, and had her sit on it. He bent down and thrust forward.

“Ouch! It’s so full… my husband has never gone this deep, ah! So comfortable…”

An Ru was not a virgin; her passage had been visited before. But in recent years, her husband often traveled for work, and they didn’t have much intimacy.

She clenched her teeth, exhaled softly, and her determined eyes turned dreamy. Her slender but beautiful face flushed red as she tried to move forward, shy and hesitant, her body trembling slightly.

Li Weijie’s hand on her slender waist felt her plump buttocks tighten. The alcohol numbed his senses and heart, making him move without restraint.

An Ru was limp with pleasure. She instinctively wrapped her arms around Li Weijie’s neck, her slender legs naturally wrapping around his waist. She moved forward, no longer caring about shame.

Soon, both An Ru and Li Weijie reached climax, releasing their desires.

An Ru came to from the afterglow of her orgasm and realized she was under Li Weijie.

Their clothes were disheveled, though not completely naked. His large member was still inside her moist passage, soft but full.

A sense of shame and satisfaction welled up in her. The intense passion from his large, steel-like member made her passage feel incredibly good.

Li Weijie was also drunk. He mumbled the names of Lin Yixin and Su Yuya, his blurry eyes staring at An Ru’s body.

An Ru was startled by Li Weijie suddenly speaking and his eyes on her. She blushed, covering her breasts with her hands and making a soft sound.

“Put… your hand away…”

Li Weijie saw An Ru’s hands blocking his view and said, “Take your hand away…”

“Too… too embarrassing… who is he? How can he talk to me like this…” But regardless of her feelings, Li Weijie pulled her hands away.

Due to his passion, Li Weijie hadn’t looked closely before. Now with blurry eyes, he wanted to see more.

An Ru’s snow-white skin, firm breasts, and small red nipples were beautiful. Her smooth abdomen had a mound of thick black pubic hair.

His member, already inside her moist passage, hardened again. He thrust forward.

An Ru felt a sharp pain and pressed his buttocks with her hands, stopping him. She said softly, “Ah… don’t move…”

Li Weijie ignored her and touched her breasts and pubic hair. His member, already inside her moist passage, hardened again. He started thrusting.

He looked at An Ru’s shy and compliant face and wanted to devour her. He lifted her chin and kissed her lips.

An Ru responded passionately, sticking out her tongue into Li Weijie’s mouth. He rubbed her large breasts.

“Teacher Mother, Wei Jie… I like you…”

Li Weijie, drunk, said as he rubbed her breasts and nipples. His member thrust hard into her moist passage, making An Ru tremble with pleasure.

“Yixin… don’t leave me…”

Li Weijie cried out, his back arching as hot semen shot into her. She hugged him tightly and moved her moist passage to receive the warm, thick fluid.

“Ah… I’m coming again…”

An Ru climaxed again, her essence flowing. She was breathless and dazed.

Chapter 13: Sharing a Bed

Li Weijie didn’t know how he left or got into the taxi, or how he returned home.

Lotus Campus, Unit 3 downstairs.

“Wei Jie, is that you?”

As Li Weijie staggered up the stairs with one foot high and one low, a familiar voice rang in his ears.

At the same time, the motion-activated lights flickered on due to high heels tapping on the floor.

The sudden light blinded him, and his vision blurred. He couldn’t see anything.

Someone held onto his swaying body, a gentle voice asking: “Wei Jie, have you been drinking?”

“Ah… it’s Teacher Mother…”

Li Weijie closed his eyes, shook his head, and finally adjusted to the light. He saw it was Teacher Mother Su Yuya.

His mind still sluggish, he didn’t consider why Su Yuya happened to be there.

Looking at her beautiful face and the bouncing, elastic breasts as she walked, he asked in a daze: “Teacher Mother… so late… what are you doing here…”

“Do you know it’s late?”

Su Yuya’s voice was gentle, like a spring breeze. But Li Weijie felt she was angry: “You ran out to drink alone, came back drunk, and ask me?”

Li Weijie was about to speak but felt a wave of alcohol. He belched and his mind went blank, nearly falling.

Su Yuya’s soft hands held Li Weijie’s palm on her shoulder. He touched the smooth skin, feeling a desire to rub.

Going up the stairs, he occasionally brushed against her breasts. Though covered by a bra, they felt firm and real…

When they got home, Li Weijie vaguely heard Su Yuya calling his name: “Wei Jie… Wei Jie, wake up…”

He couldn’t remember what happened next but seemed to have vomited and cried…

Then, he had a sweet dream. He dreamed Lin Yixin returned to him.

Though she left only days ago, he felt like a different world. She seemed changed, slightly different.

When Lin Yixin was about to leave again, he cried and hugged her tightly. He poured out his love, and she stayed.

Li Weijie couldn’t tell if it was a dream or reality. He hoped it would stay like this…

Chapter 14: Explanation

Though Li Weijie was almost unconscious last night, it couldn’t be an excuse for his rudeness to Teacher Mother Su Yuya. Even if he didn’t do anything irreparable, holding her all night was already very intimate.

Of course, one-night stands and buying sex don’t count as intimate encounters between men and women.

It seemed like an eternity before Su Yuya’s hand finally landed on Li Weijie’s face, but it wasn’t as painful as he expected. Even if she used all her strength, a fourth-level Taekwondo expert and someone who had broken through the second layer of “Quanjing,” Li Weijie only felt a slight sensation.

“Snap,” Su Yuya’s soft hand brushed his face like a gentle breeze, not causing any discomfort.

Li Weijie looked puzzled and opened his eyes. He saw Su Yuya’s tear-filled eyes, shocked: “Teacher Mother, don’t cry! Wei Jie is at fault. I just mistook you for Yixin and did this…”

When he spoke, Su Yuya’s tears flowed. He panicked, not knowing where to put his hands or how to handle the situation.

“Teacher Mother, don’t cry. It’s my fault…”

Li Weijie raised his left hand and slapped himself again. As he was about to raise his right hand, Su Yuya grabbed his arm, her soft breasts pressing against him.

Li Weijie looked up in surprise. Su Yuya’s tear-streaked face was high-pitched: “You big fool, you’re going to make me die of anger! Who’s blaming you?”

“Ah! She didn’t blame me for last night. What is she angry about?” Seeing Li Weijie’s confused look, Su Yuya gently let go of his arm.

She looked at him with a hint of resentment and turned to wipe her tears.

Li Weijie’s mind raced, but his drunk state made him slow. He still couldn’t figure out why Su Yuya was angry.

After a while, seeing Li Weijie still confused, she softly said: “Last night you just mistook me for Yixin when drunk. You didn’t do anything out of the ordinary, so why would Teacher Mother be angry?”

“Can drunkenness really be an excuse?” Li Weijie was puzzled. Su Yuya didn’t seem to blame him for his rudeness, as the slap felt more like a gentle touch.

“Teacher Mother is angry because you mistreat yourself and don’t cherish your body.”

Su Yuya sighed, her eyes glistening. “Do you know? When I saw you drunk last night and came back, I wanted to slap you.”

Li Weijie almost forgot. Recalling last night, he was shocked: “Teacher Mother, were you waiting for me downstairs all night?”

“Of course not.”

Su Yuya quickly denied it, but Li Weijie remained silent.

In the silence, Su Yuya took a deep breath and said calmly: “Last night I was watching TV at home. Suddenly, I remembered you were drinking and would have a headache tomorrow, so I made some ginger soup to sober you up.”

Li Weijie’s eyes welled with tears. He could feel her sincerity and care in her words.

Su Yujia softly said: “I knocked on your door but found you hadn’t come home. I was surprised and heard something downstairs, so I went down to see and found you drunk.”

Though Su Yujia’s explanation seemed reasonable, Li Weijie knew it wasn’t just coincidence. How could she have coincidentally found him right after knocking on his door?

Su Yujia, facing away from Li Weijie and unable to see his expression, continued: “Wei Jie, I’ll go change clothes. Even though nothing happened between us, people might talk if they see us together.”

With that, she got out of bed and walked towards the door. Li Weijie opened his mouth to call her but no sound came out.

He watched Su Yujia’s lonely figure disappear behind the door, then heard her open and close it. He sighed and fell back onto the bed.

“Ah, I bought breakfast for you, why are you still in bed?”

After a while, Su Yujia’s voice rang out again.

Li Weijie snapped back to reality from staring at the ceiling. He saw it was half an hour later.

He got up slowly, his clothes gone. “Teacher Mother, where are my clothes?”

“They’re in the washing machine.”

Su Yujia’s voice came from the living room. “You were so drunk last night, your clothes are all over the place, even mine got dirty.”

Li Weijie felt warm and a bit guilty. He remembered he had vomited last night, though the details were fuzzy.

He dressed in a new set of clothes and went to the living room. Su Yujia had laid out breakfast for him.

Li Weijie glanced at her and saw she wore a white silk low-cut top, revealing her pale neck. A platinum diamond necklace accentuated the softness of her neck. The tight top showed off her curvy figure, and her white skin was visible at the neckline, rising and falling.

Her tight skirt hugged her plump buttocks as she moved, revealing long, shapely legs in sheer stockings. The high-quality black stockings made her legs look glossy and white, adding to her allure.

Su Yujia’s expression was calm as usual. Li Weijie didn’t dare look long and sat across from her.
