**Volume 1: The Dragon's Hidden Potential Is Its Inevitable Rise**

**Chapter 001: Breakup**

"Wei Jie, I'm sorry, I…"

Lin Yixin's eyebrows were like inkwells, her beautiful eyes filled with tears, and she bit down on her silver teeth. Her voice was as gentle and melodious as a song, making one forget the pain of this world.

Wei Jie's full name is Li Wei Jie, a man as charming and carefree as his name suggests. But now he was staring in disbelief at the beautiful woman who had loved him for three years and two months and eight days, as she was about to leave him.

Tears fell unceasingly. Li Wei Jie knew that even if he knelt and begged her, it would be of no use. Once a woman's heart changes, even ten oxen could not pull her back, let alone him, a poor young man with only brute strength.

But Li Wei Jie was unwilling to give up just like that. After all, this was a love affair lasting three years. He wiped away the tears streaming down his cheeks and pleaded with a slightly pleading tone, "Yixin, is money really that important to you?"

"Wei Jie, I felt very happy being with you in university."

Lin Yixin's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly, and she said softly, "Now I am going to pursue my happiness. Didn't you say that one should sacrifice for the person they love?"

Indeed, Li Wei Jie had said such words. They were sweet nothings he and Lin Yixin exchanged under the moonlight, which now served as her reason for leaving him.

This seemingly reasonable rejection struck Li Wei Jie's heart, making it ache beyond measure and leaving him speechless.

After the graduation ceremony, he received his degree certificate, officially graduating from university. Li Wei Jie stepped out of the school gates as four years of student life ended amidst blessings and farewells.

The problem Li Wei Jie now faced was the pressure of employment. Graduating from university meant being unemployed, a common phenomenon.

Facing life's pressures, Li Wei Jie felt headaches. This year, the number of graduating undergraduates exceeded six million, and with previous graduates still looking for work, there were two million students without jobs. Altogether, eight hundred thousand college graduates entered the job market, but only a可怜的百分之三十七 of positions were provided by society.

The heavy burden of life, such as rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea, always lingered in Li Wei Jie's mind as a young man who had come from an orphanage.

Li Wei Jie sent out nearly a hundred resumes and applied for jobs everywhere, but the results were always confident departures and disappointed returns.

Under the scorching sun, Li Wei Jie had lost a lot of weight and his skin was tanned.

Li Wei Jie's mood grew heavier day by day. He even wished he could find a lottery ticket with a grand prize one day, as for buying it himself, he never believed in luck, only fraud.

And at this moment, Lin Yixin suddenly proposed a breakup to him in the rented room he lived in.

Li Wei Jie was a poor young man, while Lin Yixin came from an average family and had found a good job.

Almost stunned by this sudden news, it took him a long time to regain his senses. Anger burned in his chest as he said with trembling voice, "Who is it?"

Lin Yixin opened her cherry lips and murmured for a long time without saying a word.

Under Li Wei Jie's repeated questioning, Lin Yixin finally said the name of the third party with a fine voice like a mosquito —— Li Bin.

"Li Bin, that playboy from the College of Foreign Trade?"

Li Wei Jie silently thought to himself. Li Bin and Li Wei Jie both liked Lin Yixin in their second year of university, initiating a fierce pursuit.

However, in the end, Lin Yixin chose the handsome and tall poor boy Li Wei Jie.事后，这个花花公子Li Bin并没有死心，经常来骚扰林逸欣，但他送的贵重礼物都被林逸欣拒绝了。

Feeling a nameless rage burning in his heart, Li Wei Jie walked around the room like an angry wolf and roared, "Are you really going to break up with me for that playboy?"

"Sorry, Wei Jie. I know this is unfair to you, but I really want a better life. Let's be good friends!"

Lin Yixin said with tears streaming down her face, heartbroken.

They spent the whole day arguing, but in the end, Li Wei Jie could not change Lin Yixin's decision.

He had thought that after Lin Yixin calmed down, she would change her mind for the deep feelings between them. After all, Li Wei Jie was sure no man loved her more deeply than he did.

During the three years they were together, Li Wei Jie and Lin Yixin never had an argument. In the year of their cohabitation in their senior year, Li Wei Jie pampered Lin Yixin to the skies.

But Lin Yixin still decided to leave him, leaving Donglai City and going with Li Bin to his hometown Tianhai City.

The train was at 2:15 PM, today being the day Lin Yixin left.

In yesterday's final argument, Li Wei Jie failed to persuade Lin Yixin but she convinced him to be a man who could let go, and they parted amicably.

How funny, women are like this. They hurt the other person but still want them to be friends.

Li Wei Jie quietly watched Lin Yixin put the last piece of clothing into her suitcase, this being his last time seeing her.

Lin Yixin was so beautiful and noble. Her large black, clear eyes, soft full red lips, delicate little nose, and beautiful pure face with a refined and elegant appearance were adorned with her smooth and flawless skin. She was truly an incomparable beauty.

She also had a slender, graceful figure with soft white arms like lotus roots, long and beautiful legs, smooth calves, and two full breasts that were youthful and mature with a sweet aroma. All of this was complemented by her delicate, smooth, tender skin, making her stand tall and graceful.

Li Wei Jie looked at Lin Yixin in front of him, slightly lifting his head to prevent tears from falling. In the misty eyes, he saw Lin Yixin's graceful figure approaching him.

Lin Yixin raised her fingers like green onions and gently wiped away Li Wei Jie's tears, whispering softly, "Wei Jie, I love you! I really do. We just didn't have the right fate..."

"Don't say it anymore..."

Li Wei Jie clenched his teeth, holding back the tears in his eyes from falling and whispered softly, "Yixin, I don't blame you. Really, now I only hate myself for not being able to give you happiness."

"Wei Jie, don't be like this. This is not your fault at all. We can still be good friends, let Yixin play you one last piece of music."

Lin Yixin said and walked to the side of the suitcase, opened the violin case, took out the violin, and then melodious music filled the small room.

---

**Chapter 002: Spring Sounds**

Li Wei Jie was not a person with musical talent, but after hearing Lin Yixin play the "Kreutzer Sonata," he was deeply moved.

The music flowed like water, on a summer night, moonlight filtered through the tree shade into the room, casting dappled shadows on the floor.

Lin Yixin's figure holding the violin was as beautiful as a sculpture from ancient Greece, and the music seemed to be playing inside Li Wei Jie's body.

The music harmonized with the flow of blood, everything was so natural and harmonious that he felt as if he were in a sea of music, intoxicated with joy.

Li Wei Jie never expected her to play the "Kreutzer Sonata" so perfectly. Since they started living together, he had developed a habit where Lin Yixin would play him a piece of music every night.

Li Wei Jie felt that Lin Yixin was born for music, and listening to her play was a pleasure. But today he had no heart to listen to her violin, his mind filled with sorrow.

He remembered a time when he looked at Lin Yixin playing the violin under the moonlight, and suddenly felt an intense desire.

Li Wei Jie immediately pounced on her, pressing her down, and they made love right there. That time their passion was unprecedentedly high, making love all night long.

He didn't know how many times they made love, only remembering that when it was over, both were exhausted.

Thinking of this, Li Wei Jie suddenly found a reaction in his lower body. The physiological changes made him feel a primitive desire and impulse, which quickly spread like wildfire, engulfing him.

"Wei Jie, I felt very happy being with you in university... Now I am going to pursue my happiness. Didn't you say that one should sacrifice for the person they love?"

Lin Yixin's words of rejection echoed in his ears, as if he had been doused with cold water. Li Wei Jie's passion was extinguished instantly, allowing him to escape from the mire of desire.

"Good heavens! I'm still thinking about such things at this moment, truly a slave to my desires." Li Wei Jie slapped his forehead hard and shook his head, trying to clear his mind.

He felt ashamed of having such impure thoughts at this moment of farewell and looked up to see Lin Yixin playing the violin with deep emotion.

Lin Yixin's slightly raised corners of her mouth revealed a faint smile, sweet and innocent. Li Wei Jie suddenly felt an icy chill, as if he had fallen into a cold cellar.

Li Wei Jie was a young man with robust health, and his desire, especially physiological desire, was particularly strong.

After experiencing the delightful pleasure of love, he would have to make love with Lin Yixin every day before sleeping.

Every time he saw her in his arms, writhing and moaning with pleasure until she begged for mercy, Li Wei Jie's desire and self-esteem were greatly satisfied.

Lin Yixin was not used to Li Wei Jie's various unexpected ideas, but she would satisfy his almost perverted demands like the most gentle and considerate little wife.

Looking at Lin Yixin playing her last piece of music for him, especially the shy and coy expression on her flushed face and the subtle teasing in her eyes, it aroused his strong desire to possess.

At this moment, Lin Yixin moved gracefully, her willowy waist swaying as she walked towards Li Wei Jie step by step.

Her slender, willow-like waist swayed, her full breasts like ripe peaches, pushing the clothes taut. Her plump buttocks were invitingly displayed, showcasing her extraordinary allure.

Seeing Lin Yixin slowly approaching him, Li Wei Jie's cold heart gradually warmed up and thawed. His lips involuntarily curled into a faint smile, revealing a sunny smile as if he were looking up at heaven from hell.

Lin Yixin's face was like a rosy cloud, her shoulders as sharp as knives, her waist slender and graceful. Her figure was exquisite and natural, like a masterpiece of nature. Her long black hair was as soft and lustrous as the finest silk, her oval face with clear contours, paired with starry eyes and a red mouth, complemented by the snow-white skin of her arms. Her figure was like a mountain peak and a beautiful landscape, perfectly proportioned.

Her clear and elegant yet alluring face, her slender and supple neck, the round and delicate breasts under her white skin, all added to the allure that made people willing to sink into it and not want to come out.

Facing Lin Yixin's body that could make any man lose their soul and mind, Li Wei Jie was deeply immersed in it, unable to extricate himself.

Although Li Wei Jie had become familiar with every part of her body, kissed every inch of her skin, and could be said to know her body better than anyone else except herself, he was still deeply infatuated with her body.

As Lin Yixin's slender figure revolved around him, Li Wei Jie couldn't help but indulge in inappropriate fantasies. His heart beat powerfully.

Li Wei Jie clearly heard the sound of his heart pounding, and the blood in his veins exchanged frequently. The blood flow accelerated, the arteries expanded, and a new sensation slowly rose from his lower abdomen, causing physiological changes.

Lin Yixin smiled seductively, her eyes sparkling and charming. Her slender fingers plucked the strings of the violin with exquisite technique.

Li Wei Jie extended his trembling hands and embraced Lin Yixin's slender waist, a fragrant aroma enveloping him. It was the sweet scent of a young girl's body.

He rested his head on her shoulder, feeling the warmth of her skin. His hands greedily caressed Lin Yixin's flat and smooth abdomen, which had no excess flesh.

Lin Yixin's body trembled slightly as she continued to play the violin, but the melody of "Love Scene" was now chaotic and no longer peaceful. It carried a hint of lingering affection.

Li Wei Jie planted hot kisses on her delicate neck, his large hand slipped into the collar of her clothes...

Turning her head and leaning lightly on his broad shoulder, Lin Yixin's eyes sparkled. Her full lips were invitingly soft and red. Li Wei Jie lowered his head and kissed her fiercely, sealing her cherry lips.

Lin Yixin's moist tongue moved nimbly in his mouth, dodging his wild and domineering entanglement.

---

**Chapter 003: Beautiful Woman**

Li Wei Jie lifted Lin Yixin's white floral dress, pulling her light yellow cotton underwear to her knees. He lovingly caressed her snow-white and elastic buttocks.

Lin Yixin had put down the violin in her hand at some point, turned around, and hugged Li Wei Jie's strong waist with both hands.

Li Wei Jie greedily sucked on her sweet and tender tongue, until Lin Yixin's delicate nose and cherry lips emitted soft moans. He reluctantly let go of her full, sexy lips.

His large hand slid down from Lin Yixin's round and plump buttocks. The touch was warm and smooth, and she felt a strong stimulation in this special moment before parting.

Lin Yixin's body trembled under Li Wei Jie's teasing, and her moist cherry lips emitted alluring moans. In his ears, it was like heavenly music, not inferior to any of the world's beautiful melodies.

Li Wei Jie continued to tease her most sensitive parts, using his right hand to pull off Lin Yixin's entire top.

Lin Yixin obediently raised her hands straight, allowing Li Wei Jie to easily remove her top.

Her bust size was 34C, and she liked wearing half-cup bras. Most of her snow-white skin was exposed outside the bra.

The cups tightly held Lin Yixin's prominent breasts, which were even more erect now.

Her abdomen was smooth and soft with no excess flesh. Her cute, slightly concave navel was round and smooth, like a delicate gem adorning her snow-white abdomen.

Li Wei Jie found the button of her silk bra and gently unbuttoned it. Her plump, beautiful breasts immediately sprang out, proudly exposed in the air like two blooming flowers.

Now Li Wei Jie's eyes were bloodshot, like a traveler in the scorching desert suddenly seeing an oasis. His throat made rumbling sounds, and his primitive desire surged like a mountain flood, with the explosive force seeming to destroy everything.

Li Wei Jie threw Lin Yixin onto the bed like a hungry wolf, with unprecedented speed and strength.

Driven by desire, Li Wei Jie no longer kissed her gently. He forcefully pressed his lips against Lin Yixin's soft and tender mouth, wild and unrestrained.

Li Wei Jie kissed her thin red lips, extended his tongue to invade the gate guarded by her teeth, captured her moist tongue, and passionately kissed.

Lin Yixin was also eager and excited. Her soft tongue entangled with Li Wei Jie's domineering one, you advance and I retreat, you come and I go, exchanging saliva.

Li Wei Jie's two large hands were also not idle. One hand held one of Lin Yixin's firm breasts and squeezed it forcefully.

Lin Yixin's elastic double peaks felt great when rubbed, and compared to a year ago, they had grown by one cup size. This was the result of Li Wei Jie's hard work and dedication.

Under Li Wei Jie's teasing, Lin Yixin couldn't help but moan. Her soft body trembled violently, her head shook wildly, and her hair fluttered like snakes...

---

**Chapter 004: Farewell**

As Li Wei Jie's actions became increasingly rough, Lin Yixin's thin dress quickly left her beautiful and smooth body.

Lin Yixin's perfect body was finally revealed. She stood tall at 167 cm, with firm and round breasts, a slender waist like willow branches that could be grasped in one hand.

Her snow-white and plump buttocks were tightly wrapped by a light cotton underwear, showing great elasticity. Her round and long legs were smooth and flawless, without even a single flaw.

Li Wei Jie's hands slipped into the sides of her cotton underwear and pulled them down. As his hands moved, Lin Yixin's private parts were exposed in the gradually warming air.

Under the impact of desire, Lin Yixin also fought back fiercely. She wildly tore off his top and roughly pulled down his shorts, revealing a strong male body.

In an instant, Li Wei Jie was stripped naked by Lin Yixin. Then she suddenly pushed him away and turned around, leaning over to his crotch with her soft lips...

Sensations of pleasure came from below. Lin Yixin's skilled and娴熟的箫技瞬间引爆了李伟杰，他再也忍不住高涨的身体欲望，化被动为主动。

Li Wei Jie flipped Lin Yixin over and knelt in front of her, spreading her plump thighs...

The bed creaked with the sounds of their passionate movements.

They were immersed in passion, indulging in love and desire. The sorrow of parting did not diminish their ardor but rather became a catalyst for their physical desires.

Li Wei Jie thrust his penis deep into her vagina, pressing against the stretched labia.

Lin Yixin cried out in pain as she trembled all over.

Li Wei Jie thrust into her body, his penis tightly surrounded by the warm and moist vaginal walls. The flesh squeezed from all sides, becoming tighter as he went deeper.

Lin Yixin responded passionately, her legs trembling with excitement. She moaned loudly as she welcomed him.

Li Wei Jie's penis was deeply inserted into her vagina, and he moved rapidly. He held her breasts with one hand and rubbed her clitoris with the other.

Lin Yixin's moans were loud and clear, her beautiful body trembling as she was penetrated. She tightly held Li Wei Jie's arms and panted heavily, her clitoris rubbing against his crotch.

Li Wei Jie caressed her smooth and wet skin, admiring her dazed expression. He inhaled the enticing fragrance of her body as his penis moved faster.

Lin Yixin rose up and wildly moved, her breasts bouncing with elasticity.

Her vagina became tighter, hotter, and wetter. Her long, soul-stirring moans rose and fell as Li Wei Jie's hands moved over her slippery body, squeezing her breasts.

Her hair scattered wildly as she twisted and turned, sweat pouring down his chest.

Li Wei Jie thrust his penis deeply into her vagina, and she moved in rhythm with him. He then flipped her over again, pressing her plump thighs against his chest and breasts as he thrust deeply.

Lin Yixin hugged Li Wei Jie's neck, her body twisting. He pushed his penis deeply into the opening, and his testicles slapped against her raised cleft with a "slap slap" sound.

Her thighs trembled without rhythm, the inner muscles contracting. She held her head back and cried out in a mournful voice as the vaginal walls irregularly contracted around his penis.

Lin Yixin called out wildly, lifting her round buttocks and closing her eyes. Her head swayed left and right as her hair scattered, her face showing a dreamy expression of pain and satisfaction. After a while, she gradually relaxed, her lips slightly open as she breathed softly.

Li Wei Jie hugged her slender waist and pulled up her raised buttocks, thrusting his penis into the opening. Her vagina was wide open, with swollen labia and trembling flesh sucking on his penis. He felt an infinite pleasure as she shook her head wildly, moaning, "Ah... Can't take it anymore... Ah... Faster... Harder... Deeper... Ah... Yes..."

He looked at her, half-dead and half-alive, with disheveled hair, panting heavily. Her body was drenched in sweat and fluids on the bedsheet.

Lin Yixin lifted her round buttocks, twisting and moving to meet his thrusts. She welcomed his final push with a rhythmic sucking and penetration, suddenly feeling a spasm together, tightly embracing each other. Hot fluids gushed out as his head felt numb.

Li Wei Jie finally couldn't hold back and ejaculated inside her, reaching climax together.

After a brief rest, the battle resumed.

They completely indulged in their passion, swimming in the sea of love. They changed positions continuously, playing like dragons and phoenixes, plowing fields, embracing the dragon, pleasing each other...

All that could be thought of and unimaginable were done.

If they had been filmed, it would have been a complete textbook on love-making.

Wave after wave of climax surged over her. Under Li Wei Jie's frenzied assault, Lin Yixin screamed and moaned wildly, half-dead and half-alive. Her black hair fluttered as her body was drenched in sweat, making her delicate body wet.

The bedsheet under them was soaked with fluids and looked messy.

Suddenly, Lin Yixin's body trembled lightly. She tightly hugged Li Wei Jie's strong waist with her arms, moving her hips and buttocks. After about thirty seconds, she finally stopped moving, her face flushed with a satisfied smile as she fainted in the fourth climax.

At the same time, Li Wei Jie also couldn't hold back and ejaculated inside her, reaching climax together.

Lin Yixin's body just tightly clung to Li Wei Jie's body, trembling slightly. Her nostrils hummed softly.

After nearly half an hour of intense physical battle, Li Wei Jie was exhausted. After the climax, he fell asleep on Lin Yixin's naked and smooth body.

Half an hour later, Lin Yixin woke up. Opening her beautiful eyes, she saw Li Wei Jie sleeping on top of her, his lips slightly curved with a smile of satisfaction and happiness after the passion.

Lin Yixin gazed for a moment, sighed softly, and gently pushed Li Wei Jie's body aside.

Getting up from the bed, Lin Yixin moved slightly and felt soreness, especially her 22-inch slender waist, which seemed to be about to break.

"Wei Jie is really good in bed. When we are intimate, Yixin feels so happy..."

Lin Yixin's heart was filled with mixed emotions as she gently stroked Li Wei Jie's chiseled face, her eyes filled with love. She looked at the sleeping him on the bed with infinite tenderness.

"You always make me experience three or more climaxes, even when I was sick with a high fever in the hospital bed, we made love for an hour..."

Lin Yixin loved Li Wei Jie deeply but wanted a better life, so she had to let go of this love.

She knew Li Wei Jie loved her deeply and she also loved him. Two people who deeply love each other but cannot be together is the saddest thing in this world, very heart-wrenching and helpless. But such things are common in society.

Thinking of this, Lin Yixin couldn't help but shed tears. But her determination to pursue a high-quality life was unshakable, no one could change it.

Those women in the dormitory with average looks, what did they have that she didn't? Why do they wear branded clothes and have cars to pick them up, while her figure and looks are ten times or a hundred times better than theirs? She shouldn't be living a life of counting every grain of rice and every drop of oil...

With a more determined look, Lin Yixin took a deep breath, picked up her bra and underwear scattered on the floor, and walked unsteadily into the bathroom.

Twenty minutes later, Lin Yixin came out of the bathroom dressed neatly and picked up her packed suitcase.

She gently opened the door, took one last look at Li Wei Jie lying on the bed, and two rows of crystal tears fell from her eyes. She closed them tightly, shut the door, and cut off their emotions.

In fact, Li Wei Jie had already woken up when Lin Yixin pushed him. But out of fear, he didn't dare to open his eyes and didn't want to say goodbye.

A child's tears don't fall easily, only when they reach the heart of sorrow.

When Lin Yixin went into the bathroom, Li Wei Jie couldn't hold back his tears any longer and they flowed out.

With teary eyes, Li Wei Jie watched Lin Yixin leave with her suitcase. When the door closed, he began to cry silently, heartbroken.

---

**Chapter 005: Mother-in-law**

"Tap tap tap..."

The sudden knocking on the door woke Li Wei Jie. He wiped away the tears from his face, not wanting anyone to see him in a weak state even through the door.

"Tap tap tap..."

The gentle knocking on the door sounded again, light and graceful like a breeze passing through the trees. It was also like a gentle touch between lovers.

Li Wei Jie found it pleasant to his ears and felt very comfortable. He was sure that the one knocking must be a woman, and a cultured lady who could make such a simple action so graceful.

What would this woman look like?

Li Wei Jie opened the door to find a beautiful lady standing in front of him, elegant and graceful. She was also his mentor's wife, Su Yuyi.

Su Yuyi was a teacher at Donglai University where Li Wei Jie studied. Her husband, Professor Zhang, was his mentor.

They knew about Li Wei Jie's orphan background and took good care of him in life and study.

Unfortunately, the world is often unfair. Two years ago, Professor Zhang died in a plane crash while abroad for research, leaving Su Yuyi and a large insurance payout.

Su Yuyi was twenty-eight years old, with clear and unparalleled beauty. She had long, beautiful hair, a slender figure, and high breasts that radiated an elegant aura through her translucent white skin.

Li Wei Jie took a deep breath, composed himself, and forced a smile. "It's Mother-in-law, what do you need?"

"Are you asking me what I need?"

Su Yuyi spoke casually, like an older sister scolding a younger brother. There was genuine care and warmth in her voice.

"Look at the time, it's almost six o'clock. What are you doing?"

Li Wei Jie looked up at the wall clock and saw it was indeed almost six o'clock.

"Have you started cooking yet? Mother-in-law has cooked, come and eat something."

Li Wei Jie instinctively wanted to say he wasn't hungry. He didn't have much appetite, but Su Yuyi seemed to read his mind and said before he could refuse, "Mother-in-law knows you must be feeling terrible now. But even if you're sad, don't neglect your body. Eat a little."

With Su Yuyi's words and her position as mother-in-law, Li Wei Jie could only nod. "Thank you, Mother-in-law."

Li Wei Jie followed Su Yuyi to her home. Two sets of chopsticks were already laid out on the table, and he sat down without being invited.

This wasn't Li Wei Jie's first time at Su Yuyi's home. When Professor Zhang was alive, Li Wei Jie and Lin Yixin often ate at their house.

It was Su Yuyi who introduced Li Wei Jie and Lin Yixin. Because she was Lin Yixin's aunt, Li Wei Jie always felt grateful to Su Yuyi. He just didn't expect the end would be like this...

Su Yuyi said gently, "Wei Jie, wait a moment..."

Li Wei Jie put down his chopsticks and looked up at her in surprise.

Su Yuyi smiled sweetly, scolding him, "You're such a grown man and still crying like a cat. Go wash your face."

Li Wei Jie blushed slightly, getting up and walking into the bathroom.

Although Su Yuyi was both his mentor's wife and like a sister to him, being pointed out in front of her made Li Wei Jie feel somewhat embarrassed. Perhaps it was the male ego at play.

After washing his face, Li Wei Jie came out of the bathroom with a slightly flushed face. He didn't dare look at Su Yuyi's eyes and said softly, "Mother-in-law..."

Su Yuyi used her chopsticks to put a piece of chicken in his bowl and said gently, "Sit down and eat. We can talk later."

The intimate tone made Li Wei Jie feel a bit choked up, his eyes moist. He quickly sat down and ate silently.

The living room fell into a silence. Li Wei Jie absentmindedly shoveled food into his mouth, his mind filled with sweet nothings and vows exchanged with Lin Yixin under the moonlight, romantic dates, and passionate nights.

He was so lost in thought that he held his chopsticks still for a moment until Su Yuyi's soft sigh broke him out of it.

"Wei Jie, Mother-in-law understands how you feel. The feeling of parting from the one you love... Two years ago, when your mentor passed away, I felt like my heart was dead..."

Tears welled up in Su Yuyi's eyes as she wiped them away and comforted him, "But as someone who has been through it, I want to advise you. Your life is long and full of trials ahead. You can't be defeated now..."

"Mother-in-law, I know what you're saying, but I just can't accept Yixin leaving like this..."
