Despite possessing a wealth of knowledge and several foreign languages, his recent job applications had been fruitless. Either they said he lacked the necessary qualifications, as state-owned enterprises only recognized academic credentials and not his other skills; or he lacked relevant work experience, disqualifying him according to company regulations.

The sky was clear and the sun shone brightly upon the earth. Li Weijie gazed at the job postings, his mind filled with countless dreams.

Not far from him, couples held hands and embraced, whispering sweet nothings on this lovers' path. The men were all handsome and dashing, while the women were gentle, affectionate, and considerateâ€”truly enviable.

The tender scenes before him did not stir any interest in Li Weijie. He casually sat down, cupped his face with both hands, and stared straight ahead at the blue sky.

Was it so difficult to find a decent job? Did he really need connections for recognition? Could he not make it on his own without relying solely on martial prowess?

As Li Weijie pondered these thoughts, a couple nearby kissed passionately under the bright sun.

Li Weijie's heart raced as he watched, a sexual desire burning within him...

Suddenly, his gaze sharpened. His heart raced and he felt as if his breath had stopped.

A slender, tall woman walked across the street with the crowd of office workers. She had long, straight hair as beautiful as a TV commercial, flowing gracefully and captivatingly. Only the most exquisite beauties possessed her oval face with a smooth forehead, skin as white as snow.

Her deep eyes beneath sculpted eyebrows shimmered mysteriously. Her straight nose exuded confidence, and her soft, curved lips seemed inviting to bite. Her pointed yet rounded chin added allure to her icy beauty, making her face flawless.

Her light-colored long-sleeved silk round-neck blouse barely concealed her 38D breasts, which stood proudly. She carried a delicate blue leather bag on her shoulder and wore a knee-length thin chiffon skirt with light blue base and white dainty flowers. Her nearly transparent flesh-colored stockings and three-inch high heels accentuated her round, slender legs.

Standing at about 168 cm (later confirmed to be exactly 168 cm) with heels, she towered over the crowd like a crane among chickens. Her captivating presence made everyone around her pale in comparison.

She was the kind of beauty that one dared not desecrate. Even his usually restless younger brother remained quiet, contemplating.

Her face was as radiant as the moon, her skin like congealed fat, and her eyes deep pools. Her delicate peach cheeks exuded unparalleled beauty. She was slender yet graceful, with a waist so small it could be encircled by one hand.

Her white blouse revealed her protruding, delicate breasts. Her slender legs were smooth and long. Her pure, dreamlike aura evoked admiration for the divine craftsmanship that created such beauty.

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew a job posting into Li Weijie's arms. He picked it up and read it with a smile.

"Seeking male employees, ages 20-23, bachelor's degree or higher, fluent in Japanese and English. Please come to Room 5030 on the 13th floor, Building Yulong at Kehua Road for an interview from 2 to 4 PM."

This job posting brought a new hope to Li Weijie's heart. He felt certain he would succeed this time.

He touched his ID card, thinking that large companies should be able to download his resume and graduation certificate copies. He still had a few one-inch photos in his wallet.

Feeling somewhat reassured, Li Weijie left the park with the job posting in hand and headed towards the bus stop.

To his surprise, he saw the same beautiful woman who had captivated him earlier at the bus stop. Would such a beauty ride public transportation?

Li Weijie marveled at her youthful beauty, with long slender eyebrows, clear eyes, a straight nose, rosy lips, and smooth cheeks perfectly combined on her pure face. Her long black hair was tied into a ponytail, accentuating her graceful and alluring figure.

A well-fitted suit perfectly outlined her slender, curvaceous body. Her snow-white skin with a milky texture was irresistibly alluring.

Li Weijie quietly approached her, almost close enough to smell her fragrance. As the bus arrived, people rushed towards the doors.

He followed closely behind her onto the bus and admired her rounded buttocks, slender waist, and snow-white, round legs as she stepped on. As long as he didn't see her cold yet beautiful face, his lower body would rise.

The bus was packed like sardines during rush hour. Li Weijie and the beautiful woman were separated by a short, plump woman with acne-covered skin, small eyes, and thick lips. Her large buttocks rubbed against his thigh repeatedly.

Even more terrifying was that the woman occasionally looked up and smiled at Li Weijie with a smile so unsettling it made him shiver.

Despite his martial arts skills, Li Weijie would not back down even against armed bandits. But facing this terrifying beauty, he retreated.

Li Weijie froze in fear, afraid that any movement would provoke her further attention.

Comparing the beauty's appearance to his own, Li Weijie couldn't help but feel that fate was unfair.

It's not your fault to be ugly, but it is wrong to scare people with your appearance.

Suddenly, Li Weijie noticed the beauty's slender eyebrows furrow slightly and her soft lips purse.

Even when angry, a beautiful woman is still captivating. Her eyes flashed with anger and her face showed fear as she tried to call out but held back.

Li Weijie turned around and saw a man, barely taller than the beauty's ear, lewdly pressing against her back as they moved with the crowd and bus.

Li Weijie's height gave him a clear view of the man's hand on the beauty's firm buttocks.

As the bus moved, the lecherous man rubbed his short fingers against her. The beauty was afraid and couldn't call out, so she looked around for a way to escape.

But the bus was packed and she couldn't move. She faced the same predicament as Li Weijie.

Seeing the beauty's eyes flash with anger and her face show fear, Li Weijie immediately glared at the lecherous man.

Oh my god! The lecherous man had lifted the beauty's skirt and inserted his hand between her thighs.

Seeing him close his eyes in ecstasy, as if savoring the greatest delicacy, Li Weijie felt an inexplicable hatred and jealousy rise within him.

The beauty tried to turn away from the man's lecherous hand, but he ignored her weak resistance and moved closer to her private area.

The beauty was furious. She squeezed her thighs tightly, but quickly let go in embarrassment.

Wasn't it obvious? The tighter she squeezed her thighs, the more he could feel their fullness.

Li Weijie saw that the beauty was at a loss, not knowing how to resist. The lecherous man seemed confident she wouldn't make a scene in public, so he pressed his crotch against her buttocks as the bus shook.

The beauty was tall and slender, wearing high heels. The short man had to stand on tiptoe.

The beauty was furious and tried to avoid the lecherous man, but he held her waist tightly.

She clenched her teeth in hatred and wished she could slap him, but her shy nature made her hesitate.

Suddenly, the bus stopped at a new station.

The door opened.

The short woman reluctantly left as people got off the bus.

Li Weijie sighed in relief. As new office workers boarded, the beauty quickly turned and squeezed past the lecherous man towards Li Weijie.

The lecherous man followed, but Li Weijie smiled coldly and blocked him with his body.

The short man was reluctant to give up, but after assessing their strength difference, he reluctantly backed off.

The lecherous man turned and left to find another target.

The beauty smiled at Li Weijie in gratitude.

But suddenly, as the bus started moving again, she stumbled and was pushed against Li Weijie's chest by the crowd.

Her upper body pressed tightly against his strong chest, her full breasts pressing against him.

As the bus shifted and people pushed, her breasts rubbed against his chest.

Li Weijie could feel her rapidly beating heart and rising body temperature through the close contact.

The beauty tried to move away, but was pushed back by the crowd.

Her nose brushed against his chin as they breathed close.

Li Weijie smelled her sweet breath. She turned away shyly, her long lashes fluttering nervously.

Li Weijie warned his younger brother not to desecrate this beautiful woman.

Li Weijie's upper body was pressed against the beauty. He could feel her warm body through her thin clothes, and his younger brother hardened.

Although he had an embarrassing reaction, Li Weijie moved slightly away to avoid further embarrassment.

The beauty sensed he wasn't a pervert and accepted the situation.

Suddenly, the bus braked hard. The beauty's lower body pressed against Li Weijie's.

She was tall and wore high heels, so her private area aligned perfectly with his.

His hard member pressed against her lower abdomen through their thin clothes.

They were only a thread away from being naked, and the temptation was just as great.

Li Weijie's martial arts training had heightened his senses and body awareness.

He could feel the beauty's youthful, soft, elastic flesh. She tried to move away but was pushed back by the crowd.

Li Weijie smiled apologetically. She turned her head away, blushing and avoiding his eyes.

Li Weijie's thigh felt the heat from her leg. She blushed, her heart racing and breath quickening.

Her hot breath on his ear made him even harder.

The beauty sensed his change and showed fear in her eyes.

As the bus drove over a bumpy road, their lower bodies rubbed together intensely.

The beauty's deep eyes showed desire.

They tried to suppress their reactions, but the bus's shaking triggered their primal instincts.

In sync with the bus's rhythm, they rubbed against each other subconsciously.

Li Weijie finally couldn't resist and reached out...

The beauty rested her smooth chin on his shoulder, panting heavily. She pressed his hand against her buttocks to stop him.

She panted and suppressed her desire.

"No!" she pleaded with her deep eyes.

Li Weijie stopped, his hand still on her buttocks.

The beauty thanked him and left as the bus stopped again.

Li Weijie watched her go, feeling a sense of loss.

Despite it being June, Li Weijie was sweating profusely. His special constitution usually prevented him from sweating even in high temperatures, but the intense stimulation had caused it.

After a few more stops, Chu Jiangnan got off at the Yulong Building in the city's bustling area.

The 30-story building was a high-end office tower. The first floor housed the Tianfeng Investment Development Bank's main hall, occupying hundreds of square meters. Two lifelike stone lions stood at the entrance, giving it a grand appearance.

The bank's other departments were on the 18th floor.

Li Weijie stood before the luxurious building, looking up at its glass facade reflecting sunlight. He adjusted his clothes and took a deep breath before entering the elevator.

He pressed the button, and soon the doors opened. He stepped in and pressed "13". As he turned to close the door, a voice called out, "Please wait!"

Li Weijie held the doors open as a woman entered. She smiled and said, "Thank you!"

"Not at all," he replied.

The woman saw the "33" button and asked, "If I'm not mistaken, you're here for an interview?"

Li Weijie nodded. She smiled and said she was a Tianfeng employee, hoping he would be hired.

They shook hands. Li Weijie felt her soft hand and hesitated to let go, but she released his first.

Li Weijie regretted his awkwardness and glanced at her. She was in her thirties with a slender face, wearing a black suit and high heels. Her legs were smooth and her makeup elegant.

He couldn't take his eyes off her full breasts, which seemed ready to burst out of her clothes. He could see the lace trim of her bra through her collar.

Just as he was about to guess her bra size, the elevator doors opened. She smiled and left.

Li Weijie sighed at missing her name but consoled himself that he'd see her often if hired.

He walked to the reception desk and asked for the HR department's location.

Many fashionable women and confident men were waiting outside, but Li Weijie in his simple clothes lacked appeal.

After a long wait, he was called to interview.

The room had a simple decor with a chair in the center. The woman who called him, Miss Huang Ying, asked him to sit.

He sat nervously and looked at the two people across from him. The man, Mr. Zuo Cheng, had an impatient look and was the HR deputy manager. Miss Huang Ying wore a pink suit that accentuated her curves.

Li Weijie was more interested in Miss Huang Ying than Mr. Zuo Cheng, who seemed unimpressed.

Miss Huang Ying asked about his education and experience in English. Li Weijie, fluent in English, answered confidently.

"University bachelor's degree."

"Do you have experience as a trader?"

"No."

"What other jobs have you had?"

"I just graduated and interned at a securities company for half a year."

"Our company is one of the world's top 500, unlike securities companies."

Mr. Zuo Cheng spoke in Japanese.

"I know. I'm confident and will not disappoint you if given the chance!"

Li Weijie answered smoothly, his Japanese pronunciation flawless.

After the interview, Li Weijie saw many women outside. Some were heavily made up, some lightly, some wore revealing clothes, and some were simple.

Each tried to stand out. Some wore elegant dresses while others showed off their curves in tight clothes or mini skirts.

Li Weijie felt like he was among the gods, admiring their beauty.

Originally thinking he had no chance after Mr. Zuo Cheng's unimpressed look, Li Weijie soon received a call.

He rarely got calls except from his close friends and Shu Yuyan. It had been a while since he last received an unexpected call.

He answered and it was Miss Huang Ying. She said he had been hired, a surprising message.

Li Weijie laughed in relief and joy. People looked at him strangely.

Suddenly, someone tapped his shoulder. He turned to see Shu Yuyan smiling at him.

He looked at her flawless skin, kind smile, and full breasts. He felt nervous for some reason.

Knowing she had seen his silly expression, Li Weijie felt embarrassed and wished he could disappear.

"Shu Yuyan, I succeeded..."

He quickly told her the good news.

She smiled and said she was proud of him.

"Let's celebrate," she offered, opening her arms for a hug.

Li Weijie felt his desire rise as he hugged her full breasts.

He was excited and aroused, but she pushed him away gently.

She said they should celebrate together.

Li Weijan protested, but she insisted he was too old for her and should find someone his age.

He said she looked younger than ever, but she sighed that she was almost 30 and felt old.

He said she still looked young, but she blushed and told him to stop standing there.

"Let's go," she said, smiling.

Li Weijie nodded eagerly, making her laugh at his silly expression.

They walked to the parking lot. He noticed her round, full buttocks.

Her car was a Beetle. As they drove, the cool breeze carried her enticing fragrance to him.

He couldn't help but look at her beauty and feel excited.

She wore a thin, low-cut top that revealed her breasts and the lace on her bra. Her short skirt accentuated her full buttocks, with a peek of her bra straps.

Li Weijie felt his desire rise as he looked at her. He wondered if her bra was front or back fastened, soft or hard cup.

His rationality and morals crumbled as he looked at her breasts. He couldn't help but look between them, hoping to see more.

"Li Weijie... what are you looking at?"

She turned red and asked nervously.

"Nothing," he said, embarrassed.

He quickly looked away but felt awkward and sweaty.

They drove in silence. Li Weijie wanted to play music, but when he bent down, he saw her legs.

He froze as she closed them. He stood up embarrassed but she opened them again.

She was angry at him for looking, but couldn't help herself. Her pink panties with a sheer lace opening appeared.

He was stunned and didn't know what to do.

"Have you seen enough?"

She asked shyly but not too angry.

Li Weijie stood up, unsure if she was scolding or teasing him.

Suddenly, her second button opened.

Her breast and pink bra were visible through the lace opening. He could see a hint of her pink nipple.

He knew she had captured his attention completely. She smiled as he looked at his erection.

A gust of wind blew her breasts together, hiding the cleavage.

"Should I wait for you here?"

She parked and blushed, smiling coyly.

Li Weijie looked around and saw a hair salon with street walkers.

"I... I..."

He blushed, fumbling with his phone and checking the time, date, and battery.

He sent a text to Xia Weiwei about his job interview and acceptance.

Shu Yuyan smiled, seeing him fumble.

They drove for half an hour to a parking lot near the restaurant.

Li Weijie noticed Shu Yuyan's fashionable outfit and flawless makeup.

He had seen many beauties, but she was exceptionally stunning.

Her mature beauty was natural and her curves were perfect.

He couldn't help but think of Korean movies as he looked at her breasts and buttocks.

She blushed, pretending to fix her hair.

"Li Weijie, let's go."

He nodded and they walked together.

People rushed past them, making them stand out.

They weren't holding hands like a couple, which made Li Weijie feel awkward.

Shu Yuyan bit her lip and suddenly grabbed his arm.

Li Weijie blushed, realizing it was a couple's gesture.

He felt his heart race as they walked together.

They arrived at the restaurant without realizing how much time had passed.

The waiter was impressed and asked if they had a reservation.

This restaurant was upscale, hence the full parking lot.

Li Weijie felt her soft touch as he shook his head.

The waiter found an empty table and Li Weijie pulled out her chair.

He ordered two lemon juices, remembering she liked them.

She was touched by his thoughtfulness and offered to get him a glass of wine instead.

He smiled, not minding either way.

The atmosphere was romantic as young couples around them flirted openly.

In a nearby booth, a couple kissed passionately under dim lights.

Li Weijie felt like he was in a dream as they enjoyed their meal together.
