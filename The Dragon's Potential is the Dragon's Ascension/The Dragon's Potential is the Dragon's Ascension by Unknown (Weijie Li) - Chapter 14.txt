Zhao Yan heard Li Weijie’s voice and was slightly startled. She remembered this voice; as the car swayed, Li Weijie’s left hand slipped into her skirt from where she was holding the overhead handle, lightly caressing Zhao Yan’s slender waist. His hot palm pressed tightly against her bare skin, and his fingertips were almost touching Zhao Yan’s chest.

Li Weijie’s body pressed against Zhao Yan’s back and buttocks from behind. She almost cried out, but was surprised to find that she could not make a sound.

For the first time encountering such an intense assault, Zhao Yan’s entire body seemed to freeze. From getting into the car until now, perhaps only half a minute had passed, but Zhao Yan felt as if an eternity had gone by.

Li Weijie’s abdomen pressed tightly against Zhao Yan’s plump buttocks from behind. She silently resolved that although she had no ill feelings towards Li Weijie and he had helped her on the bus, she could not allow him to play with her pure body at will. She must make him stop immediately, but through the thin skirt, she felt so hot that the shout on her lips was stuck in her throat.

If she shouted out, with so many people on the bus, being seen in such an awkward situation would surely make her headline news tomorrow’s gossip column… just thinking of this, Zhao Yan’s face flushed red.

The courage she had mustered was immediately shattered by the harsh reality. If she moved her body, it might be seen as enjoying this sensation; Zhao Yan could not think of a way to resist.

“Not, don’t…”

Her heart pounded wildly, and she had no strength left. Zhao Yan’s tender face flushed red, her breath quickened, almost silently praying that Li Weijie would stop.

In response to Zhao Yan’s inner prayer was only the noisy sound of the bus and the silent crowd around her.

Chapter 26: Desire Train

Li Weijie’s hand lightly caressed Zhao Yan’s slender waist, while the other hand pressed against her chest through her blouse. The collar had been pulled open widely; Zhao Yan lowered her head slightly, and suddenly saw her full, snow-white breasts distorted in the hot palm. Like watching a pornographic film with several sisters in their dormitory, only now she was the main character. This humiliation turned into a flash of pleasure, resonating in every pore of Zhao Yan’s body.

A soft sound; the first button on her blouse was undone, and her full breasts seemed about to burst out.

“Ah…”

Zhao Yan had no more ways of resisting. Everything around her seemed to spin away, and she felt as helpless as if in a desert, her trembling red lips reflecting the last trace of modesty from her pure heart.

The second button was also pulled open, and Li Weijie gave Zhao Yan no chance to catch her breath. He said, “Open your mouth; let’s kiss.”

“Okay… not okay…”

The soft words made Zhao Yan’s face flush red and she refused decisively. He wanted to kiss her here; just as she thought this, her flushed cheeks were kissed twice, and then his lips became the next target. Li Weijie’s hot lips circled tightly.

Zhao Yan glanced instinctively to the right; fortunately, this was a secluded corner. Li Weijie’s tongue licked her cheeks back and forth; after several weak refusals, her tender red lips were finally caught.

Li Weijie smiled slightly and held Zhao Yan’s chin, pressing lightly with his fingertips to loosen her jaw. His tongue then slipped into the lips guarded by her teeth.

Zhao Yan’s resistance gradually weakened; their tongues were strongly attracted and entangled, slowly turning into a deep kiss like true lovers.

Li Weijie’s excitement was so intense that he let out a deep moan, savoring Zhao Yan’s forced kiss with relish. He lusted after her saliva and teased the soft, delicate tongue, sucking every drop of sweet nectar with passion and intimacy.

Zhao Yan’s face grew redder; not only were her lips violated, but also her sensitive breasts were continuously caressed and played with. Li Weijie’s other hand moved to her thighs, stroking them gently and beginning to caress the inner thigh.

Zhao Yan’s waist involuntarily arched, trying to escape but only accommodating Li Weijie’s playfulness more.

A very long kiss… Li Weijie sent his saliva into Zhao Yan’s mouth; her delicate body trembled, and while she moaned, there was no escape.

Oh… I actually drank his saliva… The modest lady’s body collapsed in shame, suddenly exhaling a hot breath.

“Your first kiss feels pretty good! Let’s do it again.”

“You, how did you know…”

Zhao Yan’s delicate body trembled; she stared wide-eyed in disbelief, her eyes filled with astonishment. Her first kiss had been taken by this man, and he knew it.

Li Weijie opened his mouth wide as if to swallow Zhao Yan’s lips, attacking fiercely and greedily.

Zhao Yan could not resist; the air in her lungs seemed to be sucked away, and suddenly she felt blank. But his kiss had skilled technique; Zhao Yan was unknowingly pressed into a completely submissive state.

Li Weijie’s tongue stirred fiercely in her mouth, sucking Zhao Yan’s tongue into his embrace.

This would drag them to the bottomless abyss; Zhao Yan trembled in surprise, and Li Weijie’s domineering voice sounded in her ear, “Stick out your tongue.”

When Li Weijie’s lips brushed past the corners of her mouth, she tried to close them tightly; now she had to open her lips and stick out her tongue. Zhao Yan’s beautiful eyes closed in shame, her long lashes trembling slightly as she opened her cherry lips and slowly stuck out a small tongue, feeling an immense sense of shame.

Li Weijie touched Zhao Yan’s tongue with his own and drew a circle.

Zhao Yan closed her eyes, furrowing her brows unconsciously from the throat, emitting a sound not just sweet but spreading to her tongue and mouth, each part feeling warm.

“Stick out your tongue a bit more.”

Li Weijie’s smile grew increasingly wicked.

At Li Weijie’s instruction, Zhao Yan felt a bit hesitant; if she extended it further, it would be the most intimate act between lovers. And the fact that he had ignited her was best not known.

In such a situation, being kissed by only someone she had met once; Zhao Yan felt it would be better to die than show any reaction.

Like a fallen angel awaiting judgment, Zhao Yan reluctantly extended her tongue a bit more, and Li Weijie’s tongue touched the trembling side of her tongue.

“Ah… ah…”

Her breathing became heavy, and from deep in her throat came these sounds. Although she tried to suppress them, the quick breaths could not be hidden.

After playing with her tongue’s surface and inside thoroughly, Li Weijie’s tongue curled up like another creature and entered again. It was as if a small insect crawled along the branch, stimulating Zhao Yan’s sensitive areas in her mouth. This sensation did not diminish.

Her body ignited with desire, as if all the sensitive areas were concentrated on her tongue. At this moment, Li Weijie’s left hand slid up to her chest and held the aching breasts.

“Mm…”

Zhao Yan closed her lips, emitting a higher moan. Not only was her tongue ignited; her slender body and breasts were also burning, and now her nerves could no longer command the aching breasts. Especially when Li Weijie rubbed them with his palm.

“Ooh…”

Zhao Yan’s upper body suddenly arched, grabbing Li Weijie’s hand to change the focus of defense. The pleasure and joy that had been ignited spread throughout her body as she was caressed, a difficult-to-defend stimulation.

The hand that grabbed Li Weijie’s hand could no longer exert force, her consciousness somewhat hazy, and defense weakened. When her tongue was sucked, her beautiful legs trembled slightly, and the part below her waist became numb.

Zhao Yan curled her fingers; her long legs tightened involuntarily. The nerves concentrated on the breasts now had to shift to between her thighs, but the already weakened defense seemed unable to function. The caresses became faster, attacking the already abandoned breasts and tongue fiercely.

Zhao Yan breathed heavily through her nose; if her mouth was not blocked by Li Weijie’s, she did not know whether she would emit a shameful sound. This question had no answer.

Her clothes were not removed by Li Weijie, but the sight of her being caressed in a white-collar work uniform was even more shameful.

“Mm mm…”

Zhao Yan’s red lips and tongue were occupied, the strength in her arms holding Li Weijie’s hands that were tormenting her breasts seemed to be snatched away instantly.

Zhao Yan cried out in her heart, “Woo woo…”

The sobs were because the sensitive areas were stimulated by Li Weijie’s caresses.

Feeling the speed of the train suddenly slow down, Li Weijie knew they were approaching a station. The subway’s announcement system was very intelligent and could adjust the volume based on noise levels inside the car. There were several large LCD screens in the carriage, and when the station announcement was made, the LCD screen sounds would stop. When the train speed exceeded 5 km/h or dropped below 25 km/h, the station announcement would automatically start.

Looking up, he saw that the LCD screen was flashing with red letters; Shuncheng Street Station was approaching. Li Weijie reluctantly released Zhao Yan’s slightly swollen lips and whispered in her ear, “Beautiful lady, my name is Li Weijie. What’s your name?”

Zhao Yan’s body was barely supported by Li Weijie and did not collapse to the ground. Dazedly hearing someone ask her name, she instinctively whispered softly, “Zhao… Yan…”

At this moment, she finally saw Li Weijie’s face again. His thick eyebrows and the heroic aura in his eyes, a pair of spirited eyes with a faint smile, a straight nose and thin lips perfectly set on his face, forming an ordinary but very appealing face. His lips were tightly pressed together, and the lines under his straight nose curved upward stubbornly. He wore a white shirt, dark pants, and shiny black shoes with a faint smile on his face, exuding an elegant charm that made women心动.

Satisfied with Zhao Yan’s name, Li Weijie gently helped her straighten her clothes. When the subway arrived at the station, he smiled and left, leaving Zhao Yan, who was burning with desire and almost unable to stand.

<><><><><><><><><><><><> “They say fortune is found in danger. No wonder I, who never gamble, have to take the bus every day.”

Li Weijie rubbed his temples. Wealth is not necessarily glorious, and poverty is not necessarily shameful, but being poor is definitely not something to boast about. Perhaps he thought of something and smiled faintly, saying, “Money is truly a good thing; with it, you can play the mistress of life. Robbing the Industrial and Commercial Bank, kidnapping Zhejiang’s richest man, seducing a rich girl; these are all ways to make big money.”

The towering Yulong Building was in sight. Li Weijie checked his watch and found he would not be late; Tianfeng Group was strict about clocking in, and the machines did not show mercy.

Just then, a Porsche 911 with a Beijing license plate stopped outside a commercial building. The area had heavy pedestrian traffic and was usually off-limits to vehicles, but there were “No Parking” signs nearby. A security guard hurried over with a frustrated look; earning only 1,200 yuan per month, he had every reason to resent the rich who drove luxury cars.

Li Weijie walked near and saw this scene. The first thing that caught his eye was a leg stepping out of the car door; he had dealt with many beautiful women and could not help but admit that this woman’s legs were extremely long and shapely. The black high heels perfectly accentuated the enticing curve of her calves, followed by a head of smooth dark hair.

The woman’s figure was flawless; she was slightly slender, not plump but graceful and elegant. She wore a black knee-length skirt, a pretty blouse, high heels, and a round-necked long jacket. The knee-length skirt was more modest and modern; it lacked the frivolity of a mini-skirt and avoided the old-fashioned impression of a long dress.

***

Chapter 27: AV

The hem slightly parted, the long skirt hanging between her thighs and knees, accentuating the curve of her buttocks. The tight knee-length skirt hugged her slender legs, and black mid-heel shoes revealed the tender arch of her feet, a subtle yet sensual allure. Li Weijie felt a pang of regret because he had seen many women with good figures but plain faces.

Unexpectedly, this woman had a very attractive oval face. She wore a pair of delicate black-framed glasses on her nose, but what was most captivating about her was her aloof demeanor. Such a quality required substantial capital; either an illustrious family background or exceptional beauty. Li Weijie’s眼前的这个女人似乎两者兼备。

The security guard, who was about to scold her, had to swallow his words. Seeing the woman’s cold expression made him shiver involuntarily; until they passed each other, he did not say a word. Only after walking away did he cautiously glance back at the beautiful woman.

There are some women who can make many men feel inferior and retreat. Li Weijie watched the woman walk away; although he was at an age where he would want to conquer any beautiful woman, all the beauties in the world could not be his for the taking. That was a privilege reserved for protagonists in online romance novels; unfortunately, his life was not a novel.

He punched the clock on time and silently sat at his desk. Li Weijie rinsed his teacup, filled it with tea, and turned on the computer. He logged into QQ, harvested his crops from yesterday, and then wreaked havoc in a friend’s QQ farm.

Savoring the aroma of tea while browsing the web, Li Weijie almost sighed with contentment.

Li Weijie’s work was going smoothly; he successfully recovered a loan from last year and, using internal company information, made some gains in the futures and stock market. His latest move brought him a ten-thousand-yuan income.

***

Opening the largest domestic forum website, Li Weijie looked at the click-through rankings: 1. China’s First Car Model Zhai Ling Involved in “Nude Photo Scandal”; 2. Tobacco Bureau Chief’s Erotic Diary Exposed; 3. Complete Set of “Nude Photo Scandal” Photos Added, No One Can Match the Boldness; 4. Video of a “Virginity Loss” by a 90s Girl Going Viral Online; 5. Italian “First Sex Goddess” Meli Giacomo’s Nudity Explained, Large Breasts Tempt Two Male Guests; 6. Fang Zhouzi Accuses “Emperor of Work” Tang Jun of Falsifying Degree, Thesis, and Patents; Assistant Li Xin Says It’s Groundless; 7. Young Teacher Tempts 900 Students, Government Claims Pure Fabrication; 8. Taiwanese 22-Year-Old Sexy Mom Chen Yifan Shares Nursing Photos, Netizens Go Wild; 9. Korean Sex Star Nam Kweili Intentionally Exposes Herself, Becomes Fashionable; 10. Fan Zhiwei Reveals Wang Xinling’s First Night Details, Breaks Entertainment Industry Taboo; 11. Anqing Official Wang Cheng’s Diary Scandal Exposed, Plans to Play with 800 Women.

The use of “gate” in news media originated from President Nixon’s resignation during the Watergate scandal. In China, “gate” events became popular with the “nude photo scandal.” These gate events are mostly negative news, often related to sexual topics.

Some of these online exposés were set up; some were for fame; some were celebrated revelations; and others fell into the category of brainless events. Li Weijie turned off his phone, removed the SIM card, and uploaded Liu Bin’s video from yesterday. Of course, he made some adjustments, blurring Wang Xiaoyan’s face and key areas.

Everything was settled; Li Weijie became idle again. He clicked on cuiweiju (Cuiweiju novel website) and began reading the novel he had been following, “Fuyu Fan Yunzhi Zuyan Qu.” Remembering the most powerful celestial beast in Chinese mythology, the invincible river crab, which was mercilessly slaughtered during its first appearance; then it resurrected as “Fuyu Ji” but was again defeated, dying a glorious death; now it’s renamed “Xingyun Lu.” Ah, but subscriptions are not as strong as before; the author is reportedly preparing for a civil service exam and updates may be sporadic.

Subscribing to and reading the new chapters, an hour passed unnoticed. Checking the time, it was already eleven o’clock; Li Weijie looked up and saw that most of the office had cleared out. The credit investment department was special; although they clocked in on time, their work freedom was much higher than other departments.

“Ah, what’s wrong with my computer?”

Li Weijie was about to turn off his computer and leave when a vexing voice sounded.

Following the sound, Li Weijie saw it was Huang Ying’s little demon. She stared at her computer, her face turning from white to red as if playing a game of changing faces. Her right hand clicked the mouse frantically, her panicked eyes showing her helplessness.

“Li Weijie, you seem to be good with computers. Can you check if my computer is infected?”

Huang Ying waved at Li Weijie and sweetly smiled, “These past two days, every time I open the browser it crashes.”

“Sure, let me take a look.”

Li Weijie walked to Huang Ying’s desk and turned on her computer. The last five colleagues in the office left, leaving just them.

First, he checked for viruses with Kaspersky and found several unknown ones hidden in the C drive, all linked to the browser.

Li Weijie used 360 Security Guard to clear the browser history, then opened Internet Explorer. Several dozen website directories remained; clicking one, the screen flashed and many windows popped up, the numbers increasing rapidly.

“Yes, it’s like this…”

Huang Ying leaned close to the computer, almost pressing against Li Weijie. She exclaimed, “These can’t be deleted; they keep multiplying the more I delete them. I dare not click anymore.”

Sniffing Huang Ying’s perfume, Li Weijie inhaled deeply. His hands moved quickly on the keyboard, opening a window where the numbers did not change.

“You’re so good…”

Huang Ying was about to say more when she was silenced by the image on the screen.

Both were stunned; the office fell silent, only their heartbeats audible, growing faster.

The image that popped up was a classic pornographic picture. In it, Jizze Mingbu’s sister posed in an exaggerated manner, her voluptuous body straddling a man. The intimate area was clearly visible, vivid and arousing.

Japanese people imagine High Tree Maria as a teenage idol, Lin Zhiyi; Taiwanese people imagine Bo Do Yi as Lin Zhiying. Mainland Chinese imagine a certain male lead as Old Bi, while Hooper imagines a man with a bra on his head as Wild Child. As for the main female lead Jizze Mingbu, Hong Kong people call her “Little Deng Lixing,” and some unscrupulous media use her AV photos to create a “Deng Lixing Nude Scandal.” Who is right or wrong, outsiders cannot know. However, if one evaluates based on their industry status, perhaps Deng Lixing should be called “Little Mingbu”!

“Close it… close it quickly…”

Huang Ying reacted first, exclaiming.

Men are usually slow to react to such images; they often have a desire to continue looking because it is so tempting.

Mingbu’s sister had excellent natural conditions. Her face was not stunningly beautiful but still very attractive, always smiling sweetly, making people feel comfortable.

Her bust and skin were not the best but still very alluring.

Standing at 161 cm, her proportions were perfect and she often appeared tall in films.

Even Kungkong envied this. Someone once asked Kungkong, who did she envy the most in terms of body type? She answered without hesitation: “Of course, Jizze Mingbu! She is so beautiful and has such good skin. At 160 cm, her legs look incredibly long!”

Li Weijie was daydreaming when Huang Ying’s exclamation snapped him back to reality. He muttered, “Damn, why is it this?”

Fumbling around, he found that not only could he not close the images, but more windows kept popping up like a slideshow. In an instant, over thirty vivid pornographic images appeared, each more arousing than the last.

Li Weijie saw this and quickly bent down to force-shut the computer, the screen going black. He sighed in relief; he had acted fast enough to avoid burning out the motherboard.

The office was deathly silent, both staring at each other awkwardly.

Li Weijie and Huang Ying had inadvertently learned a vivid biology lesson about male and female reproductive organs. Huang Ying’s rosy cheeks remained, her lips moving as if she wanted to say something but didn’t know how. She looked like someone whose privacy had been exposed.

Li Weijie guessed she wanted to explain something and smiled inwardly. What was there to explain? He knew the computer had been infected with viruses from browsing websites or playing games. It was amusing and absurd that this girl had such a habit.

The office felt slightly dull; the pornographic images gone, Li Weijie’s mind cleared. He broke the silence with a dry laugh and said, “Actually, I hate Japanese AV; so people like Song Dao Feng, Tsukasa Kaori, Watanabe Akari, Kurosawa Ai, Mizuki Ryo, Futaba Ran, Hanai Aya, Takemitsu Maki, Soga Zuiko, Tachibana Riko, Minami Anna, Kuroi Aoi… I’ve never even heard of them.”

A cold joke made Huang Ying laugh. She didn’t know who Watanabe Akari, Kurosawa Ai, and Mizuki Ryo were but recognized Tsukasa Kaori, Futaba Ran, Hanai Aya.

Li Weijie asked Huang Ying if there were any important files on the computer and got some software. Reinstalling the system seemed to be the only solution.

Reinstallation would take time; both sat in front of the computer, staring at the unresponsive screen. They were likely daydreaming.

Li Weijie’s favorite was still called the “goddess of AV,” Song Dao Feng. Although she wasn’t his type, she had a perfect 34D bust and snow-white, long legs…

“Li Weijie…”

A voice from outside broke Li Weijie’s fantasies. He looked up and saw a flawless face, long lashes, emerald eyes, a small nose, and red lips that made her pale cheeks look charming.

Possibly due to exercise, Li Na’s figure was perfect. Her slender waist had no excess fat; her full buttocks were plump and elastic, and the flat Western-style skirt suit barely concealed her nearly protruding breasts and buttocks.

Seeing Li Na at the office door, his first thought was that she had come just in time. He stood up and smiled, “Looking for me?”

“No reason, it’s lunchtime; I came to invite you.”

Li Na’s cheeks flushed slightly.

Checking his watch, Li Weijie saw it was past twelve. This morning had passed quickly; he glanced at Huang Ying, asking if she wanted to join them.

Huang Ying had recovered and stood up. “I won’t go; I’m on a diet. And thank you for fixing my computer.”

The scent of orchid and musk filled his nostrils, making Li Weijie feel refreshed. He smiled at Huang Ying and saw her long white neck and delicate collarbone, gazing greedily before returning his eyes to her dimples, nodding with a smile.

Chapter 28: Ambiguity

A voice from outside broke Li Weijie’s fantasies. He looked up and saw a flawless face, long lashes, emerald eyes, a small nose, and red lips that made her pale cheeks look charming.

Possibly due to exercise, Li Na’s figure was perfect. Her slender waist had no excess fat; her full buttocks were plump and elastic, and the flat Western-style skirt suit barely concealed her nearly protruding breasts and buttocks.

Huang Ying had recovered and stood up. “I won’t go; I’m on a diet. And thank you for fixing my computer.”

The scent of orchid and musk filled his nostrils, making Li Weijie feel refreshed. He smiled at Huang Ying and saw her long white neck and delicate collarbone, gazing greedily before returning his eyes to her dimples, nodding with a smile.

This naughty guy; where was he looking? Noticing Li Weijie’s gaze sweep over her full breasts, Huang Ying’s cheeks flushed red. She quickly turned her head and glanced at Li Na with watery eyes, wondering why Li Na knew Li Weijie and seemed to have a good relationship with him, even inviting him for lunch.

Li Weijie and Li Na had lunch at the cafeteria. Returning, he特意给黄莺带了一份快餐，那小妮子都瘦成那个样子了，哪里还用得着减肥。 下午本来以为还是没有什么具体事务可干的李伟杰却被召唤进了沈墨浓的办公室。 沈墨浓和颜悦色地交给李伟杰一份资料，让他去找对方签一份合约，接着不给他说话的机会，直接让李伟杰现在立刻去办这件对公司来说“十万火急”的事情。 我不是信贷投资部的么？怎么这种找模特拍广告的事情也让我去？李伟杰郁闷地离开了办公室，留下独自偷乐的沈墨浓，她昨晚翻来覆去睡不着，想出了一个折腾李伟杰的点子。 天枫集团是跨国企业，旗下包括有各个子公司十数个，公司的确要找人拍摄一组MV，只是代言的商品是女性内衣，而且这事情本来归属子公司的设计部门管理策划，可是现在却直接被沈墨浓丢给李伟杰来做，想到李伟杰在一众美女模特包围下，手足无措，手忙脚乱，站立不安的样子，沈墨浓就忍不住笑出声来。 李伟杰坐在办公椅上，翻看着手中的档案，立时瞪大了眼睛，居然是让她去找一个人气美女拍摄一组MV和几组写真，靠，居然代言内衣。 他奶奶的，我进的是商务公司，产业虽然五花八门，但大体以地产、信贷、融资、股票、期货为主，怎么现在要我去给什么内衣拍广告？李伟杰有些呆滞地翻看着手中的资料，资料还算详尽，只是却要去一趟台湾，前前后后大概要两个星期左右。 “看你一副愁眉苦脸的样子，怎么了？” 黄莺在李伟杰回到办公室后就一直一惊一乍的，小妮子好奇心旺盛非常，于是一脸戏谑地看着坐在靠椅上思索的他，笑嘻嘻地道：“难道扣你薪水了？” 李伟杰翻了翻白眼，道：“凭什么扣我工资？我工作努力，今天我以公司为荣，明天公司以我为荣……” 黄莺坐到他对面，“噗哧”一笑，掩着小口道：“那你在那里苦恼什么？” “机密！” 李伟杰淡雅一笑，然后又轻声叹道：“这是很重要的事情，必须保密。” 黄莺眼中睛光闪闪盯着他看了几眼，八卦之魂熊熊燃烧，压低声音娇声道：“快点说嘛！我保证不会说出去。” “不会吧！在你的印象中我是那么容易犯错误的人吗？” 李伟杰故作惊讶地道：“公司可是有保密条理的。” “谁说你容易犯错误了，只是人家真的想知道嘛！” 黄莺嗔白了他一眼，轻笑一声道：“好了，这个你就别装了，还是说说看你为什么去了部长那一趟，回来就变成了这样吧！” 李伟杰近距离审视着黄莺娇美的容颜，淡淡地道：“这件事情是能告诉外人的，嘿嘿……” 黄莺听他这么一说，表情变得有些失望，但接下来李伟杰另有深意的“嘿嘿……” 了两声又从新点燃了希望。 黄莺一把抓住李伟杰的胳膊，迫不及待地追问道：“你嘿什么，有什么就直说呗！” 李伟杰故意色眯眯地盯着她那胸口u形领下，一双高耸饱满的酥胸挺拔而微露在外雪白的乳沟，坏笑道：“但是假如你不是我外人，那又是另一回事了。” 黄莺羞涩地垂头看了一眼自己的美白的胸口，脸上现出一阵娇红的羞态，却没用去遮挡外露的春光，反而挺胸抬头，瞪眼嗔道：“你那天，那天把人家那样了，难道还不够吗？” 李伟杰一脸冤枉道：“那天，那天是意外，而且我才是受害者。” 说罢！贼兮兮笑吟吟的扫视着黄莺成熟美艳，凹凸玲珑的娇躯。 黄莺俏脸飞红修长的美目狠狠盯着他，猛地一咬牙，抬头含羞瞧着他道：“你是受害者？难道你还想害回来不成？哼，你敢么？” “你看我敢不敢。” 李伟杰嘴角逸出一丝邪笑，双目色光烁动，身体悄然的离开了座位朝对面的黄莺移去。 黄莺见之娇躯一震，俏脸忽明忽暗，芳心却是莫名地一喜，高耸的酥胸微微地起伏，俏眸异彩一闪而过的凝视着李伟杰，红唇轻启，皓齿略现淡定的嫣然一笑道：“你这坏家伙，别以为做做样子吓唬我，我就会怕了。你今天要是不告诉什么事，我还真是不走了。” 李伟杰确实是戏弄之意，毕竟这里还是办公室，虽然快到下班时间了，同事几乎已经走光了，他俯头过去，先在她的粉颈大力嗅了几下，然后贴近她的脸蛋，道：“真的不怕，那我可就要动手了。” 黄莺表面上在故作镇定，心里却是一阵激动、羞怯，一方面即有点期待李伟杰会做出点什么不轨的举动来；另一方面又害怕他真的对她做出什么羞人的事。 黄莺娇媚艳丽的她脸上的羞意渲染了一身，雪玉一般洁白晶莹的肌肤上到处蔓延着娇艳的桃红色，中人欲醉，艳丽得让人晕眩。 李伟杰从上往下的盯着她高耸酥胸上诱人的凸起而挤压成一道深深的雪白沟谷，她发现李伟杰在直瞄着她丰挺润滑的酥胸，原本就红扑扑的脸颊更是罩上一层薄粉，俏脸加倍地鲜艳起来，偏偏却佯作若无其事直视着正前方，道：“你有胆量就来呀！看谁怕谁。” 黄莺一张含羞带怯的俏脸不敢有丝毫转动，怕稍有不慎会贴上了李伟杰的大嘴。 本来无心吃美女豆腐的李伟杰听到黄莺放话出来，不经暗想：“看来今天我不做点什么出来还真对不起广大人民群众了。” 李伟杰一伸手，移到她近在咫尺的摸上她浑圆修长柔美雪白的大腿，嘴里啧啧赞道：“黄莺，你的玉腿滑腻腻的，真是又结实又充满弹力，手感是相当的不错啊！” 灼热的手掌在敏感大腿上的运动，黄莺立刻产生了触电般的感觉，这一刻，她甚至忘记挣扎，忘记了呼吸，忘记了自己的心跳，只觉一阵淡淡的男性特有的味道扑鼻而来，不由心神一醉，整个人有都有点搞不清方向了。 黄莺下意识的夹起微微颤抖的双腿，羊脂白玉般的娇靥晕红，俏脸含春，芳心又羞又喜万般，美眸羞合，“嗯……” 一声娇羞万分的嘤咛，羞红了双颊。 一股如兰似麝的馨香扑鼻而来直沁心扉，曲线玲珑肤如凝脂充满成熟娇躯让李伟杰不由得心神一荡，没容他有更进一步的动作时，脚步声不合时宜的响起了。 突如其来的声音，一下子惊醒了有些手足无措，心神迷醉的黄莺，她有些急忙推开俯身站在他身旁的李伟杰站起身，慌乱的整理起裙摆和衣裳，神情仿若一对的偷情的男女被人撞破了一般。 相比而言，李伟杰是泰然自若，一脸促狭的笑看着黄莺，不紧不慢地回到了自己的座位上，抬头看着玻璃门外的过道。 几个呼吸的工夫，门外走入一位青春貌美，笑颜如花的女孩，不是别人，正是已经算得上是第二次撞破李伟杰好事的李娜。 她眼见着黄莺满脸红霞，不禁奇怪地看了她一眼，笑道：“黄莺，怎么下班了还没走？” 李娜只是随口一问，可听到黄莺耳里却又是另一种意义了，以为被李娜看出点蛛丝马迹，她赶忙插口急道：“那好，我下班了，不打扰你们二人世界了。” 说罢，水灵灵的大眼睛偷偷地瞪李伟杰一眼后，不看被她轻描淡写一句话搞得俏脸通红的李娜，扭着细腰，踏着碎步款款而去。 李娜看了她的身影一眼，李伟杰直勾勾的盯着她轮廓鲜明、线条优美的侧面，笑道：“李娜，下班了还不走？莫非是来约我吃晚饭的？” 明知道李娜肯定是有事才过来找他的，但李伟杰还是故意在言语上戏弄她。特意给 Huang Ying brought a lunch, that little girl was already so thin; she didn’t need to be on a diet. In the afternoon, Li Weijie was summoned into Shen Moinong’s office, thinking he would have nothing to do. Shen Moinong handed him a document and told him to find someone to sign a contract, then immediately sent him off on this urgent task for the company. Wasn’t he in the credit investment department? Why was he tasked with finding models for an advertisement? Li Weijie left the office, leaving Shen Moinong to laugh alone. She had been tossing and turning all night, thinking of a way to torment Li Weijie.

Tianfeng Group was an international company with numerous subsidiaries. They needed to find someone to shoot a music video, but the product was women’s underwear. This task originally belonged to the design department of a subsidiary, but Shen Moinong had given it to Li Weijie. She imagined him flustered and disoriented among the beautiful models, which made her laugh.

Li Weijie sat in his chair and looked at the documents. He was surprised to see that he had to find a popular beauty to shoot a music video and several sets of photos, all for underwear. He was in the business department; their main focus was real estate, credit, financing, stocks, and futures. Why did he have to go shoot an advertisement for underwear? He looked at the detailed documents and saw that he would need to travel to Taiwan, which would take about two weeks.

“Why do you look so worried?”

Huang Ying had been watching Li Weijie since he returned to the office. She was curious and asked, “Are they cutting your salary?”

Li Weijie rolled his eyes. “Why would they cut my salary? I work hard; today the company is proud of me, tomorrow I’ll be proud of the company…”

Huang Ying sat across from him and giggled. “Then what are you worried about?”

“Confidential!”

Li Weijie smiled and said, “This is an important matter that must be kept secret.”

Huang Ying looked at him with sparkling eyes, her curiosity burning. She whispered, “Tell me quickly! I promise not to tell anyone.”

“Wouldn’t you say I’m easy to make mistakes?”

Li Weijie said, “The company has confidentiality rules.”

“Who says you’re easy to make mistakes? I really want to know!”

Huang Ying glared at him and said, “Alright, stop pretending. Tell me why you went to the department head’s office and came back like this.”

Li Weijie looked closely at Huang Ying’s beautiful face. “This is something I can tell you, heh heh…”

Huang Ying’s expression turned disappointed when she heard this, but Li Weijie’s “heh heh…” reignited her hope.

Huang Ying grabbed Li Weijie’s arm and asked, “What are you laughing about? Just tell me!”

Li Weijie looked at her chest and said, “But if you’re not my outsider, it’s another matter.”

Huang Ying looked down at her white chest and blushed. She didn’t cover the exposed cleavage but lifted her head, glaring at him. “You did that to me on that day; wasn’t it enough?”

Li Weijie said, “That was an accident. I was the victim.”

He then looked at her curvaceous body with a mischievous smile.

Huang Ying blushed and glared at him. She said, “You were the victim? Do you want to get even?”

“Do I look like I’m afraid?”

Li Weijie smiled and moved closer to her. Huang Ying’s body trembled, her face changing from red to pale. She looked at him with a mix of joy and surprise.

“You naughty guy, don’t think you can scare me. If you don’t tell me what’s going on today, I won’t leave.”

Li Weijie leaned down and sniffed her neck before whispering in her ear, “If you’re not afraid, I’ll do something.”

Huang Ying pretended to be calm but was excited and shy inside. She hoped Li Weijie would do something, yet feared he might embarrass her.

Huang Ying’s face blushed as she looked at Li Weijie. She said, “You have the courage to come? Let’s see who is afraid.”

Li Weijie moved his hand towards her smooth, round legs and said, “Huang Ying, your legs are so soft and firm. They feel really good.”

The heat from his hand made Huang Ying tingle, forgetting to struggle or breathe. She smelled a faint masculine scent and felt dizzy.

Huang Ying instinctively squeezed her legs, blushing. She said softly, “Mm…”

Li Weijie was captivated by her curvaceous body. Suddenly, footsteps sounded.

Huang Ying was startled and pushed Li Weijie away, hurriedly fixing her clothes. She looked like a couple caught in the act.

Li Weijie was calm, smiling at Huang Ying as he returned to his seat. A beautiful girl walked in; it was Li Na, who had caught him twice.

Li Na saw Huang Ying’s flushed face and asked, “Huang Ying, why are you still here?”

Huang Ying thought Li Na had noticed something and quickly said, “Alright, I’m leaving. Don’t disturb your world.”

She glanced at Li Weijie and left.

Li Na looked at her, then smiled at Li Weijie. “Li Na, why are you still here? Are you inviting me to dinner?”
