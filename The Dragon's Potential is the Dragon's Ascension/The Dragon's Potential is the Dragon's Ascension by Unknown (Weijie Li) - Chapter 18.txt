Li Weijie knew Su Yuyan was definitely a normal person because she had fainted. He laughed foolishly and said, “How could a fairy faint?”

“What fairy?”

A soft voice suddenly came from the dimly lit living room, startling Li Weijie. He turned around and saw Xia Weiwei.

Although the light was dim, Li Weijie could still see that Xia Weiwei was wearing a sexy nightgown. The cutout revealed her enticing curves.

“I said you are as beautiful as a fairy, and I couldn’t sleep thinking about you…”

Li Weijie lecherously hugged Xia Weiwei as she walked towards him, his hand already grabbing her beautiful leg.

“Do you really want me?”

Xia Weiwei offered her fragrant lips.

“You don’t accompany your mother-in-law, Weiwei?”

Li Weijie kissed Xia Weiwei’s nose and then sucked on her tongue.

“I want you! I couldn’t sleep, so when I saw Teacher Su sleeping, I came out to see you.”

Xia Weiwei wrapped her arms around Li Weijie’s neck, pressing her prominent chest against him.

“Can’t sleep and come to seduce me?”

Even a fool could tell Xia Weiwei was in the mood. Li Weijie, however, loved it when she was like this; his hand made her gasp with desire.

“Who let you tease me just now…”

In the dim light, Xia Weiwei’s hot body told Li Weijie she was ready.

Sure enough, Xia Weiwei deliberately let one strap of her nightgown slip off, revealing her round and high breasts.

“Be careful not to catch a cold…”

Li Weijie tenderly grabbed her breast and gently rubbed her nipple, causing Xia Weiwei to collapse in his arms.

“You’re so naughty, teasing me…”

Xia Weiwei panted softly, her eyes filled with desire.

Li Weijie grinned and began to touch Xia Weiwei all over, arousing her like a cat in heat. She impatiently undid Li Weijie’s pants.

“What are you doing? What if we wake up Teacher Su and Liu Yucqing?”

Li Weijie whispered, realizing Xia Weiwei was as interested in sex as he was.

“I don’t care! I want you…”

Xia Weiwei pushed Li Weijie’s hands away and grabbed his private parts.

Li Weijie laughed; how could he protest against a beautiful woman’s assault? He wanted Xia Weiwei to release her passion.

Today, Xia Weiwei was different—crazy and passionate. She eagerly spread her legs over Li Weijie, until she felt him fully inside her. Xia Weiwei moaned in ecstasy: “Oh…”

“Be quiet, my lady! Don’t wake up the whole family…”

Li Weijie anxiously looked around because Xia Weiwei’s moan was a bit loud.

Xia Weiwei pulled down the straps of her nightgown, and her breasts swayed as she moved. Her eyes were filled with desire.

Li Weijie supported the two mounds, and Xia Weiwei said softly: “Weijie, I’ve decided. I want to be your wife… really like you, Weijie Brother, marry me… ah… I’m coming…”

Xia Weiwei shook her hair wildly; perhaps because she was teased too much in the hallway, or due to the unfamiliar environment and the possibility of being discovered by Su Yuyan and Li Yuqian, her pleasure came faster than expected.

“So soon?”

Li Weijie was surprised but Xia Weiwei had already collapsed on him, motionless. Helplessly, Li Weijie licked her breasts: “Let me… lie down…”

Xia Weiwei, like a lamb awaiting slaughter, let Li Weijie do as he pleased. Her round buttocks were like a full moon.

Just when Li Weijie was about to act, he noticed someone in the corner of his eye. Though the light was dim, Li Weijie could tell someone was watching them.

He didn’t know who it was but knew it wasn’t the crazy Li Yuqian.

Li Weijie didn’t want to guess further because whoever it was, they had been watching for a while.

Since they had watched for so long, there was no need to hide. Li Weijie’s panic turned into excitement; he decided to continue and experience the thrill of being watched.

Thinking this, Li Weijie’s already soft member swelled again, more menacing than before.

Xia Weiwei, lying on the sofa, didn’t notice anything unusual but felt Li Weijie’s change. She almost screamed when he entered her, saying: “Oh, so full… so full…”

“More is coming!”

Xia Weiwei’s provocative pose made Li Weijie bolder. His movements became rougher and faster.

“Ah, ah, ah…”

“Scream louder, let everyone hear…”

Li Weijie lifted Xia Weiwei and moved her to the lamp by the sofa, illuminating her graceful figure.

Of course, Li Weijie wanted to make it easier for the voyeur to see his actions and impressive physique.

Men who spy on women like different parts—face, neck, chest, waist, buttocks, legs, feet—but women who spy on men only like one thing.

“Ah… so many tricks…”

Though warned, Xia Weiwei tried to suppress her moans but Li Weijie’s movements made it hard for her to enjoy. She began to complain.

Li Weijie ignored Xia Weiwei’s complaints, lifting one of her legs and having her lean on the sofa back. This way, the voyeur could see better.

Li Weijie wasn’t sure if it was a sexual act or a performance; for him, both were the same. Displaying his prowess in front of other women heightened his desire; his movements became more intense.

“Oh! Just like this, husband. I’m coming again… ah…”

Xia Weiwei felt the thrill of being in her teacher’s living room with him and his dry daughter-in-law nearby. Her whole body was sensitive, and Li Weijie’s arousal made her climax wave after wave.

Li Weijie wasn’t done; his heightened desire burned through him. He gently withdrew, and Xia Weiwei opened her mouth as he inserted his member covered in liquid.

“Ahh…”

A faint scream reached Li Weijie’s ears. Though soft, he clearly heard the direction and looked but saw no one.

Taut nerves relaxed as Xia Weiwei’s playful tongue gave Li Weijie a jolt. He shuddered, and a strong stream erupted.

Xia Weiwei was startled, trying to spit it out but Li Weijie held her head. His eyes softened as he pleaded: “Don’t spit it out, my dear Weiwei… please…”

Xia Weiwei opened her beautiful eyes and gently complied. The amount was too much for her to swallow, but she did as Li Weijie watched her throat move.

The climax over, Xia Weiwei continued to lick. Li Weijie’s eyes searched for the voyeur but saw no one. He smelled a faint fragrance.

The next day, Li Weijie woke up early around six o’clock. He got dressed and left the sofa, not because he was uncomfortable but to practice his martial arts.

He placed sheets of white paper around the room, and as he practiced, each punch or kick lifted a sheet. His movements became faster, and soon all the papers were floating in mid-air.

Suddenly, a muffled sound. Li Weijie’s fast-moving figure stopped; he struck out with a quick punch, hitting the first sheet of paper.

“Peng!” The paper shattered into pieces. His punches continued, hitting the second and third sheets.

Each sheet was torn apart until the eighth one, which he pierced with his wrist. Li Weijie paused, then leaped, his legs slicing through the air, shattering all the papers into fluttering pieces.

“Fifteen broken with legs, one less than two months ago. I’ve regressed! My punches are even worse; how did I miss two? Color is the bane of my strength, indeed. Should I abstain?”

Li Weijie shook his head: “I should focus on upper body strength.”

He cleaned up and left for work.

At the Yulong Building, Tianfeng Group’s Investment Credit Department office, Huang Ying was angry: “How could there be such a pervert! Thank goodness he was caught. Who is this good Samaritan? The newspaper should have taken a photo!”

Li Weijie smiled as he entered: “Who made our Miss Huang angry? What’s the matter?”

Huang Ying brightened, then pretended to be composed. She slapped a newspaper on his desk: “Read it.”

Li Weijie read the headline, *Hong Kong Man Rapes Multiple Girls and Women in Donglai*. The man looked familiar. He scanned the article: “Yesterday, a resident reported an armed suspect in Lotus Community. The police arrested him; he was Wan Jianwen, who committed multiple robberies, rapes, and murders. He was caught by a Li surnamed good Samaritan…”

“Wan Jianwen was cautious, using clothes to cover the ground and condoms before raping. He cleaned up afterward. Sometimes he returned to Hong Kong immediately.”

“Donglai prosecutors accused him of taking nude photos and violently assaulting victims. Eight were injured; his crimes were heinous.”

Li Weijie felt guilty for castrating Wan Jianwen but shrugged. He smiled at Huang Ying, who had made him coffee.

He opened QQ and saw his video titled “Rich Second Generation’s Affair” had gone viral. The female lead was blurred, but the male was clear. Internet sleuths found out Liu Bin’s family history.

Li Weijie felt a sense of revenge but realized his actions were petty. Was he driven by jealousy?

Would Lin Yixin see it? Would she react? Knowing Liu Bin’s nature, would she return to him?

Li Weijie felt a surge of anger. Liu Bin said he hadn’t slept with Lin Yixin, but could that be true?

Huang Ying’s avatar flashed on his screen. “Dopey, what are you doing? You’ve been staring at the monitor for half an hour.”

Li Weijie replied: “Thinking about you.”

Huang Ying sent a picture of an angry fist but Li Weijie saw her smile.

In August, the weather in Donglai was hot. After a rainstorm, it cooled down.

Li Weijie left work early to visit Su Yuyan at the hospital and give a statement.

At noon, students from Zhonghai University left school. Girls chatted excitedly about going shopping.

Among them was a standout girl, Zhong Liying. With her clear eyes and delicate features, she stood out in a black halter top that accentuated her large breasts. Her brown wavy hair cascaded over her shoulders.

“Liying, want to go shopping?”

“No, I have a date.”

Zhong Liying walked away with her LV bag. Someone snorted: “She’s the ‘school flower’; she has a boyfriend.”

Zhong Liying heard and felt proud. She inherited her mother’s beauty, becoming popular in school for her looks and personality.

In 2008, she entered Zhonghai University. Her reputation as a “school flower” turned into “school J,” as she was seen with different men and rumored to be a prostitute.

Her photos went from innocent to provocative. Some were nude, resembling Japanese AV stars.

Zhong Liying hailed a taxi and headed to Longhu Three Thousand City. She drank milk claiming it had breast-enlarging properties.

She didn’t notice the men following her, their eyes cold yet burning with desire.

Zhong Liying was twenty, 165 cm tall, with a slender figure and beautiful face. Her halter top was tight, showing her bra’s outline. Her short skirt revealed her long legs in sheer stockings.

She walked gracefully, avoiding puddles. The alley was quiet; she saw her date soon.

“Yay! I can buy the dress I wanted…”

She was excited, her breasts bouncing under her school uniform. Li Weijie saw her and thought she looked pure but had a hint of experience.

He approached, admiring her figure. Her breasts were smaller than Su Yuyan’s or Xia Weiwei’s, but he wondered how they felt.

Her walk was seductive. He noticed her aura of experience and watched as she walked past him, then turned to look at him.

“Stupid, what are you looking at? Never seen a beautiful girl?”

Li Weijie was confused. He saw men following her, looking menacing.

“Hey! What are you doing? You’re not going to let me pass?”

Zhong Liying saw the men and panicked. One stepped on a puddle, splashing her stockings.

“Ah!”

She cursed: “You clumsy fool! What are you doing?”

The man apologized, but Zhong Liying was angry. She saw the men behind him and said: “Move! My boyfriend is coming.”

The man laughed, showing yellow teeth. “What? Don’t give me face, you slut?”

His friends laughed. Zhong Liying was furious: “Move! I’ll call for help.”

The man smirked. “I’ll move… but first, let me see your face…”

He pushed her, and she screamed: “What do you want?”

“We just want to have some fun with you…”

Zhong Liying was scared, her face pale. She tried to run but tripped on her high heels.

“Ah! Help!”

She ran towards Li Weijie, who saw the men following her. He picked her up and held her.

“Hey! This is none of your business, leave the girl to us…”

Li Weijie looked at Zhong Liying. “You’re Zhong Liying, I’ve heard of you.”

Zhong Liying clung to him. “Don’t leave me, please…”

The men were annoyed: “Hey! Get out of the way!”

Li Weijie looked at Zhong Liying. “Why should I save you?”

Zhong Liying said: “I’ll do anything, just help me…”

Li Weijie looked at her. “If you agree to be with me, I’ll help…”

Zhong Liying was shocked: “You’re so shameless!”

Li Weijie smiled. “I’ll help if you agree…”

Zhong Liying looked at him, then the men. She said: “Okay, I’ll be with you…”

Li Weijie nodded and punched the leader. The man flew back, screaming in pain.

The others attacked Li Weijie, but he was quick. He knocked them out one by one.

The remaining men were scared and ran away, leaving Zhong Liying with Li Weijie.
