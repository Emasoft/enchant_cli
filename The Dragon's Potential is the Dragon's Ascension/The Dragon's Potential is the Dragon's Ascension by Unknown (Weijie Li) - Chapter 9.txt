A moment later, the two parted lips. Li Weijie caressed Xia Weiwei’s lustrous black hair with one hand while tenderly kissing the tears that flowed from her beautiful eyes, gently teasing her: “Weiwei, does it still hurt?”

“Big bad guy, you’re so naughty… bullying me…”

Xia Weiwei panted, blushing and coquettishly complained. Her limbs were still limp, her warm, tight flesh enveloping Li Weijie’s thick member, feeling a scorching pain akin to a scrape. Her eyebrows slightly furrowed, though she felt embarrassed, the deed was done, so she closed her eyes and let him proceed.

Li Weijie’s seductive techniques were highly skilled. Each caress stirred Xia Weiwei’s passion like plucking the strings of a zither, his entire body slowly pressing against hers as he gently entered and withdrew. His left hand encircled Xia Weiwei’s neck, kissing her while his right hand continuously played with her breasts, kneading and caressing them to further stoke the flames of desire within her.

As Xia Weiwei’s passion began to rise, Li Weijie kissed her rosy lips fervently. His hands gently massaged her high and firm breasts, his hips moving rhythmically as he thrust in and out. Xia Weiwei’s desire was pushed to its depths, plunging her into a sea of lust.

After Li Weijie’s prolonged teasing, Xia Weiwei felt an unquenchable fire burning within her.

Her starry eyes closed, her face flushed red. Her hands tightly gripped Li Weijie’s shoulders as a warm, tender tongue entwined with his. Her soft moans never ceased as her willowy waist and snow-white buttocks swayed to meet his thrusts. Her long, firm legs tightly clung around his waist, rubbing and entwining with him.

With each thrust from Li Weijie, a mixture of warm spring water and blood trickled from her maiden’s passage, adding an aura of poignant beauty against the white sheets.

After a short while, Li Weijie turned Xia Weiwei over and had her straddle him in the position of a woman on top.

Xia Weiwei’s face was flushed like rouge, but the itch from her private parts made her heart race and unable to control herself.

Especially in this position, the thick member could penetrate deeper. Xia Weiwei felt as if an iron rod was firmly lodged deep within her, the tingling sensation unbearable. She began to sway gently, her beautiful buttocks and thighs moving in rhythm with Li Weijie’s thrusts.

Xia Weiwei felt infinite shame, but her body, tormented by desire, began to move slowly and rhythmically.

Though she was shy and told herself not to do this, a daughter should be reserved… yet her body did not listen. Gradually, she sped up the rhythm.

This position allowed for deeper penetration and since it was Xia Weiwei’s initiative, she reached greater pleasure. Her moans grew louder as her mind focused solely on the pursuit of lust.

She placed her hands on Li Weijie’s chest, her long hair scattering like clouds as her breasts bounced rhythmically. Li Weijie’s eyes dazzled, and he couldn’t help but caress her full, snow-white breasts.

Li Weijie could not resist sitting up and sucking on her left breast. He held Xia Weiwei’s buttocks with his thighs, rubbing them as he caressed her breasts. He leered: “Weiwei, this is where you pee, so soft and tender… too wet… too beautiful… I want to love you to death…”

Then, he stood up and pressed her onto the bed, thrusting vigorously.

Xia Weiwei’s sensitive spots were attacked, and she could not help but moan. Li Weijie made her feel like a celestial being, forgetting everything.

Suddenly, an orgasm hit Xia Weiwei. Her entire body trembled as her delicate flesh clamped tightly around Li Weijie’s member, drawing him in with a suction that made his body shudder. A hot stream gushed from her depths, causing Li Weijie’s member to quiver.

“Weiwei, I love you…”

Li Weijie roared as he thrust deeply into her. He held Xia Weiwei’s buttocks and rubbed them vigorously, his member erupting like a volcano, spewing hot lava into her depths.

The world seemed beautiful. Li Weijie felt light and invincible, everything seeming possible.

They indulged in the bliss of their passion, striving to prolong this joy.

After several rounds of thunderous pleasure, both were exhausted from their first intense encounter.

They wiped themselves briefly and lay side by side on the bed, not caring about their naked bodies or the sweat and fluids.

Li Weijie held Xia Weiwei, smoothing her hair as he caressed her body, helping her recover from the intense passion.

“Making love with a man is dangerous,” this was a warning every girl received as she began to understand the intricacies of love. Yet, it is an inevitable step for every woman who falls in love. Xia Weiwei held Li Weijie tightly, curled up like a kitten in his arms, her eyes closed and enjoying the unique scent only she could discern.

Li Weijie was unusually energetic, showing no signs of fatigue. He knew Xia Weiwei could not withstand his vigor after her first encounter.

He pulled the blanket from under the bed and covered them both, their naked bodies entwined as they fell asleep.

---

The next morning, Li Weijie woke up before dawn. Xia Weiwei, inexperienced and exhausted from the previous night’s exertions, slept deeply.

The single bed was now a bit cramped with both of them. Xia Weiwei’s head rested on his arm, her hands between their bodies, her legs curled up as if she were wrapped in him.

Xia Weiwei wore a thin, transparent nightgown with black lace. Li Weijie had dressed her after their lovemaking the previous night, and he could faintly see the pink cherry on her chest.

Li Weijie swallowed hard. He remembered last night’s sweet cherries and looked at her pink, luscious body hidden beneath the lace. Each glance made his body tremble involuntarily.

From head to toe, her black hair spread across the pillow, long lashes slightly curled, a delicate nose, rosy lips, and skin as white as milk. Her snow-white peaks with pink nipples were visible beneath the lace. Xia Weiwei’s abdomen was smooth and flawless, and below it lay a dense forest of black hair. Her rosy face, luscious lips, delicate nose, and snow-white neck made him recall last night’s passionate scenes. His hand that rested on her body began to roam.

Suddenly, he noticed Xia Weiwei’s eyelashes fluttering and her breathing quickening. He knew she was awake, pretending to sleep.

Li Weijie’s hand on her body grew more forceful. He caressed her buttocks and then moved to her chest, holding her full breasts and gently pinching the pink nipples.

Xia Weiwei could no longer pretend. She opened her eyes and pushed his hand away, saying: “What are you doing? You’re not老实even when I’m just waking up?”

“I was just admiring how beautiful you look sleeping.”

“Don’t do that again, or else…”

“What will you do?”

Li Weijie teased: “Will you sleep with me like this every night?”

“You… hum, I won’t talk to you anymore.”

Xia Weiwei turned away from him and pulled the blanket over her, leaving Li Weijie exposed.

Li Weijie was surprised but saw her back trembling slightly. He sat up and looked at her, seeing she was playing with him.

He smiled mischievously: “That won’t do. You have to say ‘no’ twice.”

He lifted the blanket and touched her behind, finding that she was already wet.

Xia Weiwei gasped as he touched her. She quickly covered herself and pulled the blanket tighter, but it was too late.

Sure enough, she had been aroused by his touch. Her body was particularly sensitive, and a man’s touch made her even more so.

Li Weijie looked at the moisture on his hand, feeling a strange excitement. He showed her the sticky substance and sniffed it, teasing: “You have to say ‘no’ twice.”

Seeing her face turn red, Li Weijie almost laughed out loud. He continued: “Besides, we have a contract now. You can’t ignore me.”

Xia Weiwei blushed and asked: “What ‘contract’?”

Li Weijie pointed to the bedsheet, where there were spots of blood and yellow stains. “Look!”

Xia Weiwei gasped: “Ah…”

She turned away, embarrassed.

Li Weijie saw her reaction and realized he had teased her too much. He began to soothe her.

“Sorry, Weiwei, don’t be angry! It’s my fault.”

He hugged her tightly and whispered in her ear: “I was just joking with you. I used to joke around with my friends, and it became a habit.”

He held her closer: “I feel so happy when I’m with you, and I can’t help but joke. Please forgive me.”

Xia Weiwei struggled at first but then relaxed, feeling his warm breath on her ear. She asked: “Did you joke with Lin Yixing like this?”

She regretted it as soon as she said it, but Li Weijie answered: “Weiwei, past is past. I…”

He turned her to face him and continued: “I know what you’re thinking. It doesn’t affect me now because I truly love you from the heart.”

He kissed her softly and said: “From the moment you came to me, I was attracted. You’re beautiful and easy to approach.”

He continued: “I tried to forget, but your care and love touched me. I realized you weren’t just helping me with studies or living here.”

He added: “I struggled at first, but I couldn’t resist. You’re so wonderful, and my feelings for you have changed.”

“Do you remember when I scared you in the kitchen?”

Xia Weiwei nodded, and he continued: “That’s when I truly fell in love with you. And from that moment, I knew you loved me too.”

He kissed her again: “I’ll love you forever. Weiwei…”

Xia Weiwei kissed him back, and they embraced.

---

After another bout of passion, they calmed down. Xia Weiwei looked out the window and saw it was still early morning.

She wanted to take a shower but felt uncomfortable. As she tried to sit up, pain shot through her.

Li Weijie noticed and asked: “Weiwei, what’s wrong?”

She blushed but didn’t answer. He looked at the bed and saw blood on the sheets.

He touched her gently, causing her to make sounds. She turned away and said: “What are you doing? It’s all your fault! I feel so uncomfortable.”

“Do you want me to join you?”

Xia Weiwei looked at him and said: “You’re so naughty.”

She walked unsteadily to the bathroom, and Li Weijie followed with a smile.

He heard water running and had an idea. He opened the door quietly, seeing Xia Weiwei under the shower.

Her body was stunning: snow-white skin, full breasts, a slender waist, and long legs. She sang softly.

Li Weijie entered the bathroom, seeing her beauty. Xia Weiwei covered herself and said: “You… how did you get in?”

Li Weijie smiled: “My body feels uncomfortable too. Can I join you?”

Xia Weiwei covered herself with a towel and said: “No, wait until I finish. Then you can come in.”

Li Weijie hugged her and kissed her, and she melted into his embrace.

They stood under the shower, water cascading over them. Xia Weiwei’s towel fell off, and Li Weijie held her close.

They slipped a bit but managed to stay upright. Xia Weiwei hit Li Weijie’s chest and said: “You’re so naughty.”

He rubbed her chest gently, feeling her heart beating fast.

Xia Weiwei said: “My heart is still pounding.”

Li Weijie kissed her again, and they embraced.

Xia Weiwei’s body was perfect: full breasts, a slender waist, and long legs. Li Weijie wanted to make love again.

He held her close, his member pressing against her. Xia Weiwei’s body softened and she welcomed him.

They tried different positions but found it difficult to enter. Li Weijie lifted her leg, and she held onto him.

Xia Weiwei said: “Let’s take a shower first. We can do anything later.”

Li Weijie agreed, and they washed each other.

Xia Weiwei’s skin was smooth under the soap. Li Weijie caressed her body, lingering on sensitive spots.

She enjoyed the sensation and rubbed him too. Li Weijie was about to climax but managed to hold back.

After the shower, they returned to bed. Li Weijie held Xia Weiwei close, and she rested in his arms.

He kissed her softly, and they caressed each other. Their passion grew intense again.

Li Weijie thrust deeply as Xia Weiwei moaned softly, her body swaying. She said: “Ah… so big… Weijie… ah… so comfortable…”

She bit his lip, and he thrust harder. She moaned: “Ah… you’re so big… I’m dying…”

Her body was filled with pleasure, her moans growing louder. Li Weijie thrust vigorously.

Xia Weiwei’s body trembled, and she moaned: “Ah… so hard… Weijie… I’m losing it…”

Li Weijie changed positions, holding her legs apart. He thrust deeply, and Xia Weiwei’s body convulsed.

She was exhausted, so Li Weijie held her gently and kissed her forehead. She slowly recovered, kissing him back.

Her tongue caressed his lips, and he kissed her deeply. She panted softly, her cheeks flushed.

She turned over and pressed him down, kissing his neck. Li Weijie’s desire grew again.

She straddled him and lowered herself onto his member. He thrust deeply, her body clenching around him.

She moaned: “Weijie… you’re so good… ah… I’m losing it…”

Her body swayed, and Li Weijie caressed her breasts. She moaned louder.

Suddenly, she grabbed the sheets and arched her back, moaning loudly. Her body convulsed as he thrust deeply.

They reached a climax together, their bodies trembling with pleasure.
