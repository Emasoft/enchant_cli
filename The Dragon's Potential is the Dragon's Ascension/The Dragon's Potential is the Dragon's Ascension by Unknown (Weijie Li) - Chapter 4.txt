Chapter 15: Weiwei

"Teacher Mother, I really troubled you last night."

Li Weijie thanked her softly and then lowered his head to take a fried dough stick, eating it.

Now Li Weijie was even afraid to look at Su Yuyan straight in the eye. He felt something vaguely, but since she was his teacher mother, he could only bury everything in his heart.

Because he didn't know what to do if the whole thing was just a feeling of his own, and he had acted out of love for her. How could he face Su Yuyan in the future?

"What are you being polite to me for?"

Su Yuyan put a bun into Li Weijie's bowl, "You definitely didn't eat anything last night. Come on, have more buns."

"Weiwei, what's wrong? Are you still embarrassed about last night?"

Su Yuyan smiled slightly and said, "I've already told you that I don't blame you. Why are you still thinking about it? Haha, your face is red! I didn't expect that you have such thin skin!"

Li Weijie showed a bashful expression, his mood was somewhat complicated.

"Weiwei, why did you suddenly think of drinking alcohol last night? Did something happen?"

Su Yuyan suddenly changed the subject and asked about yesterday's matter.

Li Weijie sighed and confessed, "I was thinking of Yixin."

"Just because that you went to drink alcohol?"

Su Yuyan frowned slightly, her eyes full of pity.

"My mood was indeed a bit restless yesterday, so I impulsively went to drink alcohol."

Li Weijie nodded awkwardly and said, "I caused you a lot of trouble, Teacher Mother. I'm really sorry."

"Trouble is a small matter, but harming your own body is the big issue."

Su Yuyan's expression turned serious and she said, "Weiwei, it's not that I'm saying this to you. It's the easiest way to harm your body by drinking alcohol when you're sad. This time, I won't say anything, but if you do this again in the future, Teacher Mother will not take care of you."

"Teacher Mother, Li Weijie knows he's wrong!"

Su Yuyan's concern made him feel embarrassed. He didn't want to纠缠 on this issue anymore, so he changed the topic and said, "By the way, Teacher Mother, did you remember to search my pockets when you put Li Weijie's clothes in the washing machine last night?"

"Of course, they're all there!"

Su Yuyan pointed to the side of the TV set. Li Weijie got up and walked over, seeing that his wallet, keys, lighter, cigarettes were all there. And it seemed like something else was added...

Seeing that Li Weijie had sat back down, Su Yuyan asked, "There's a lot of things?"

Li Weijie nodded. In his hand under the table, he was silently playing with a delicate business card. The pink background only had her phone number and name, An Biren.

<><><><><><><><><><><><>Today was the second day of the school's talent exchange fair. After everything was settled, Li Weijie took a car to school. At nine o'clock in the morning, it was already crowded with people, and even the square outside the gymnasium was filled. Each booth was packed with handsome men in sharp suits and beautiful women.

After handing out more than ten resumes, Li Weijie hurriedly squeezed out. This place was not a place for people to stay, it felt like a big steamer.

Walking along the shaded path of the school, the osmanthus trees on both sides had been there for more than twenty years. The sunlight filtered through the branches, leaving a patchwork of light on the ground.

The gentle breeze blew over the trees, making a "swish" sound. It naturally brought up a cool feeling in his heart.

The news of Li Weijie and Lin Yixin breaking up spread from somewhere. His friends were all sad for the sincere love he had given, but there was one exception.

Xia Weiwei. Since she entered the school, she had been at the top of the four most beautiful girls in the school. She was also the head of the student council's cultural department and the captain of the gymnastics team...

She brought one surprise after another to all teachers and students with her abilities and talents. She graduated from university with a bachelor's degree in international finance and business management, then two years later she obtained an MBA degree and a certified public accountant certificate. Now she was pursuing her doctorate in law.

Because she had lived with her parents, who were diplomats, in Europe since childhood and occasionally returned to China to stay at her grandparents' or maternal grandparents' homes for a while.

So, besides Chinese, she could also fluently use English, French, German, Latin, and Italian.

Since entering university, Xia Weiwei had won more than ten city-wide and out-of-school awards with her superb piano skills and beautiful physique.

Surrounded by many flowers, she showed no arrogance at all. She gave a sincere smile to everyone, which made her almost have the support of the whole school. But she still had no pursuers. Maybe because she was too excellent, everyone felt an unconscious inferiority when standing next to her. She became a person that others could only admire from afar.

She had an indescribable fresh beauty, and she had been at the top of the beauty list for years. No one ever raised any objections, and some even said she shouldn't be on the list because it was a degradation to her. The others couldn't compare with her, and there were even fierce arguments about this...

Xia Weiwei's parents weren't only children, but due to various reasons in the past, both families ended up with only one child, Xia Weiwei's parents. When Xia Weiwei was born, she naturally became the focus of everyone in the family and the apple of their eyes.

"Even the moon has its phases, and people have good and bad luck." When Xia Weiwei was in her second year of university, her parents died in a car accident on the highway in Europe. The four elders were all bedridden when they heard the news, although Xia Weiwei took good care of them after returning to Donglai City. However, within half a year after she returned to school, the three elders passed away one by one, leaving only her grandfather.

In addition, she had an uncle in Donglai City who was a police officer. He died on duty a few years ago, leaving only his mother and daughter at home. Xia Weiwei's cousin, who was three years younger than her, had a dream to become a police officer after her father's tragic death. She wanted to eliminate all the bad people in the world. Xia Weiwei and her cousin, who had both lost their loved ones at an early age, felt the same pain. Xia Weiwei's relatives were few, and the two sisters became particularly close later on. They even celebrated when her cousin was admitted to a police academy.

This year, it was Xia Weiwei's second year of her doctorate. She had already completed all the required courses and only needed to write a doctoral dissertation.

If everything went smoothly, she would graduate next year with her doctorate and officially finish university. Whether she chose to study abroad or develop in China, her future was limitless.

Chapter 16: Favored

In theory, Xia Weiwei and Li Weijie were two people who would never intersect.

Xia Weiwei was nearly three years older than Li Weijie. In today's rapidly developing society, a difference of three years couldn't be considered as two generations with a generation gap. However, there were undoubtedly significant differences in their life views and ways of thinking.

However, destiny is something that no one can foresee or control.

This time, the fates of two unrelated lives were tightly intertwined at an unknown point in the future. And because of this seemingly insignificant change between these two people, countless lives were unknowingly altered.

Li Weijie had once unintentionally saved Xia Weiwei. That time, he was beaten by over thirty thugs who had dragged her into an alley and ended up in the hospital himself.

But because they were three years apart and four grades apart, Li Weijie, the hero who saved a beautiful girl, didn't end up with Xia Weiwei. They maintained a relationship closer than friends or lovers but weren't lovers.

Because Li Weijie had already had a very beautiful girlfriend, Lin Yixin at that time.

Xia Weiwei was confident in her charm, but Li Weijie always treated his intimacy very calmly. The more he did so, the more complicated Xia Weiwei's feelings for him became until she couldn't even distinguish them herself.

They had also strolled on campus, read in the library, and eaten at the cafeteria, but there were no rumors about them. No one believed that a girl like Xia Weiwei would date Li Weijie knowing he had a girlfriend.

Xia Weiwei's special feelings for Li Weijie should be due to the fact that he saved her. This was everyone's, including Lin Yixin's, one-sided idea. She could only bury her feelings deep in her heart.

And when Xia Weiwei accidentally discovered that Li Weijie's girlfriend was holding another man's hand, looking happy while shopping on Chunxi Road, she felt an inexplicable disdain and anger in her heart. But there was also a hint of relief and joy.

"Weiwei, can I sit here?"

A pleasant female voice pulled Li Weijie out of his reverie.

Those who knew Li Weijie called him Weiwei, especially most boys. But this familiar female voice was definitely calling him for the first time because there was a clear hesitation and awkwardness in her voice.

Li Weijie was sitting at the southeast corner of the highest floor of a reading room in the library's southeast corner.

Because the southeast direction of the library faced Jinghu Lake, which was the largest and most beautiful lake in the school surrounded by several smaller lakes or artificial ponds connected by a small river running through the campus, like a huge and shiny bunch of grapes, with Jinghu Lake being the largest and most attractive grape.

To get enough light, the windows of the library were designed to be large. The window sills were much lower than those in classrooms, so sitting on the chair by the window could overlook Jinghu Lake and two other nearby lakes. This was why Li Weijie liked to sit here.

Li Weijie raised his head and looked at the person who had disturbed him before he could get comfortable on the chair. A bright smile appeared in front of his eyes.

She had long, shiny black hair that fell over her shoulders. Most of it was naturally draped down from behind her ears to her shoulders and back, with a strand hanging in front of her ear; delicate eyebrows curved slightly above her bright black eyes, long eyelashes fluttering with each blink of her eye; a straight nose with a slightly upturned tip, not too wide, making it look cute and adorable; a small red mouth with fleshy lips tightly closed, making him admire the ancient Chinese word "cherry lips" immensely.

Her chin was not sharp but slightly round, which matched her face perfectly; a hint of peach red could be seen on her jade-like white cheeks; two small, clean and transparent ears that were neither too dry nor too droopy, with fine blood vessels visible in the light, especially when facing the sun, the fine hairs on her face and ears shimmered with gold. This appearance could only be described as "saintly pure"...

Her shoulder-length hair was tied up with a purple ribbon, looking smart and efficient, very different from her usual ladylike image. She wore a light yellow T-shirt with a full and round chest, and below it was a deep blue sports short skirt that revealed her white, slender legs. She wore sports shoes with the ankles showing off a flesh-colored stocking.

She didn't wear any makeup today, looking fresh and natural like a lotus flower emerging from the water under the morning sun. She looked very lively, full of energy and vitality.

Xia Weiwei showed a charming smile, her cherry lips red and slightly open with an enticing taste. The two small dimples on the corners of her mouth were deep and adorable.

'How did I not notice that Xia Weiwei, the top beauty of Donglai University, was so beautiful and charming?' Li Weijie shook his head. Suddenly he felt that he had only seen Lin Yixin's beauty, seeing and thinking of her alone, ignoring the beauty and charm of all other girls.

'I gave up a whole forest for one tree, a whole prairie for one blade of grass, and an entire harem for one woman. It was a huge mistake!' Li Weijie thought of how he had been heartbroken and unable to eat or sleep after a woman left him. It was really not right!

Lin Yixin had left him, she should be the one to feel sad and not himself. On the contrary, he should feel lucky. From now on, the sky was high enough for birds to fly and the sea wide enough for fish to leap. Li Weijie was completely free again, regaining the right to own a whole forest and prairie.

"Weiwei, I haven't seen you for so long. Have you missed your sister?"

Xia Weiwei affectionately held Li Weijie's right arm, not at all shy. She looked like a happy little woman.

'How did I have such thoughts?' Xia Weiwei's words woke Li Weijie from his fantasy. He patted his head, feeling strange about his thoughts. Could it be that Lin Yixin's departure had really changed him?

Suddenly, Li Weijie felt a tingling sensation in his arm. Two warm and soft mounds were tightly pressed against it.

He turned his head to look at Xia Weiwei, who was leaning close to him. Beneath her curved eyebrows were big eyes full of affectionate meaning, her small mouth tightly pursed and red and inviting. A deep cleavage was revealed below her pink neck, with the white flesh of her breasts shining in his eyes.

Li Weijie's breath tightened. A seed of male desire sprouted in his heart, growing and thriving...

Chapter 17: Co-habitation

"Weiwei, have you found a job?"

Xia Weiwei gently stroked her hair and moved gracefully.

"Hmm? Oh! No, not yet..."

Li Weijie answered softly without raising his head. After all, his academic performance wasn't great, and the current employment rate for college students was very low.

"Have you thought about taking the postgraduate entrance exam?"

Xia Weiwei didn't think much of it. She knew very well whether Li Weijie had a job or not. If he did, why would he come to the school for an employment fair?

Li Weijie shook his head. He didn't know why he felt a bit uneasy in his heart about Xia Weiwei's question.

"Everyone has their own aspirations. Not taking the postgraduate entrance exam is fine, but you should study English well. I got a perfect score on the TOEFL."

Xia Weiwei smiled and said, "Do you want me to tutor you in English?"

Li Weijie looked up in confusion. He knew that Xia Weiwei's foreign language skills were top-notch in the whole school, even higher than those of teachers from the Foreign Languages Department. With her help, it would definitely be beneficial to improve his English skills.

But Li Weijie just couldn't understand why she was offering to help him study English today, especially since he had already graduated.

"This... this..."

Li Weijie didn't directly refuse but stammered, "Weiwei Sister, you should be busy writing your doctoral thesis."

"I'm not just busy for you. Hehe, I have conditions."

Xia Weiwei paused and then immediately stated her requirements, "I heard that the housing in Lotus Community is very good and quiet. I'll be writing my doctoral thesis next semester, so it's inconvenient to do it in the dormitory. My relatives' homes are not in Donglai City, so I want to move in and rent a place with you. I'll stay there until I finish my thesis, which will take no more than a semester. During this time, I'll tutor you in English and improve your listening, speaking, and reading skills. As for writing and translation, it's hard to make progress in a short time. As the cost of tutoring you in English, I won't pay rent to you. How about it?"

"Just these?"

Li Weijie swallowed hard, feeling that he was getting a great deal. A beautiful woman strongly requested to live with him! And in China, the current situation had already aligned with international standards. Fluent English could greatly help him find a satisfactory job.

"Just these!"

Xia Weiwei nodded, her beautiful eyes sparkling like water.

"Alright then. It's a deal."

After knowing the reason, Li Weijie agreed readily. After all, his house was empty anyway, and when he was alone, he always thought of Lin Yixin. With Xia Weiwei around, the situation might be much better.

After agreeing, Li Weijie joked, "Then thank you, Miss Liu..."

"Alright then. Let's make it official."

Xia Weiwei giggled softly, her smile charming and beautiful, "I want to move into your place this weekend so I can get used to the environment."

"Alright! Weiwei Sister, when do we start tutoring?"

"Tomorrow! We'll start tomorrow. Hmm, get up at six in the morning, we'll exercise on the school playground first and then study..."

After saying this, Xia Weiwei picked up her LV small bag and left Li Weijie in shock.

She didn't care or even hear the pain in his voice, "Six o'clock... exercise... study room... Oh my..."

<><><><><><><><><><><><> The next morning, two alarm clocks on Li Weijie's bedside "beep beep beep..." and "ding ding ding..."

One alarm clock was on the pillow, within easy reach so he could throw it away while still hearing its sound. The other alarm clock was placed far away, so he had to get up and turn it off himself.

Li Weijie sat up and took several deep breaths of cold air. His muscles adjusted slightly with his breathing, driving the sleepiness out of his body. He got up and went to the bathroom.

When Li Weijie arrived at the playground's fence, he saw a graceful and agile figure stretching and exercising in the place they had agreed to meet.

He didn't expect Xia Weiwei to have already arrived. He quickly walked up to her.

At the same time, Xia Weiwei, who was doing gymnastics, noticed him. Her bright eyes flashed with a gentle smile.

She stopped her graceful movements and wiped the sweat off her forehead. She casually adjusted her hair tied up in a ponytail.

As Li Weijie approached, Xia Weiwei greeted him with a smile and raised her pale wrist to look at the pink electronic watch. She said, "Not bad, you're not late."

"Good morning, Weiwei Sister, I'm here."

Looking at her in a sports outfit with a ponytail and flushed cheeks from just exercising, Li Weijie felt that she looked different from yesterday.

"Don't stand there when you just arrive. Go and exercise too. Go, run a 10K around the playground. When you come back, I'll talk to you about the English tutoring arrangements."

From his gaze, Xia Weiwei knew what he was thinking. So she gently pushed him on the shoulder to interrupt his daydreaming.

"If you really can't run it, just do half of it today."

She added as an afterthought. A 10K was indeed terrifying.

"Hmm."

Li Weijie agreed casually, but when he started running, he woke up. "10K? Do you think I'm a marathon runner?"

He grumbled unwillingly in his heart, but his legs didn't stop because of the "face" issue. Before breaking through the second layer of the Fist Scripture, running a 10K would definitely exhaust him. But after breaking through the bottleneck and reaching the second layer, he ran the first 5K quite easily. However, when he reached 8K, his body started to feel a bit strained. He wasn't running slowly; he was running at medium speed, not as fast as the flying man Liu Xiang, but his speed was definitely limited.

He panted like a bellows, feeling as if lead weights were attached to his feet. His lungs and airways burned from the cold air, and he felt a splitting headache.

Just when there was only 1K left, suddenly a cool air current flowed from the top of his head down to his abdomen through both cheeks and chest, then passed through his perineum along the spine back up to the top of his head. Then it continued this cycle repeatedly.

Li Weijie was surprised to find that as the air current moved, all the pain he had felt from running gradually disappeared. His body was now more relaxed and comfortable than ever before.

This unknown thing seemed like a small snowball rolling down from the top of a mountain, getting bigger and faster. In no time, it had grown much larger than when it first appeared.

The speed of the last 1K even broke the world record for 100 meters, and he did it ten times in a row.

After finishing the 10K, Li Weijie slowed down and jogged back to Xia Weiwei.

"Weiwei, I didn't expect you could run so well. You're worthy of being the president of the Jeet Kune Do club."

Xia Weiwei originally wanted to punish Li Weijie for staring at her just now by making him run, but he actually finished it and ran incredibly fast. "Today's exercise is over. Starting tomorrow, we'll continue to train."

She turned around gracefully and handed the materials she had taken out to Li Weijie. Her face was already calm again, and she deliberately put on a serious expression and said, "Weiwei, from now on, I'll give you an English book or magazine every morning. It could be any type of article. I'll specify a certain article and require you to finish reading it within the specified time, then you need to summarize its content and your comments in English."

She paused for a moment. Seeing that Li Weijie was listening quietly, she continued, "I'll ask you questions about the specified article in English and have you answer them in English. This is the morning arrangement. In the afternoon, you can arrange your own content. In the evening, I'll require you to memorize words. Actually, there's no need to memorize them by rote. Although this is the golden time for job hunting, it's like sharpening your knife before cutting wood. Only by enriching yourself can you find a more ideal job. Do you have any objections to this arrangement?"

"At your command, Weiwei Sister! I completely submit to your wise leadership."

Li Weijie saw through Xia Weiwei's act of seriousness and deliberately answered in a stiff voice, even imitating the Japanese salute from a movie to Xia Weiwei.

As a result, both of them burst out laughing at their own and each other's actions.

They chatted for a while longer, then left the playground together.

<><><><><><><><><><><><> Time flew by, and more than a week passed.

Since that day, Li Weijie and Xia Weiwei had been learning English according to the agreed schedule every day.

On Saturday morning, Xia Weiwei brought a suitcase and a large backpack of things and quietly moved into Li Weijie's rented house in Lotus Community, starting their new life of "cohabitation."

Li Weijie's house was on the fifth floor of Unit 3 in Lotus Community, not far from their school. This also made it convenient for Xia Weiwei to go to school.

The spacious three-bedroom apartment was cheap thanks to Su Yuyan's connections.

Li Weijie still lived in his original room, while Xia Weiwei chose the room next to his bedroom to live. The reason was that she wanted to be close by and supervise him in his studies.

At first, Li Weijie always felt strange. It seemed that Xia Weiwei had some kind of special ability, able to influence him through the walls, making his heart uneasy and his hands fidgety.

After a few days, Li Weijie gradually got used to Xia Weiwei's presence and also adapted to the life arranged by her.

After Lin Yixin left, Li Weijie's life had another person in it.

Since Xia Weiwei moved into his house, he and she went to the school playground every morning for exercise. He ran while she did gymnastics; then they returned home to wash up and change clothes, eat breakfast. After breakfast, they started their intensive tutoring in the study room.

This routine continued for about ten days. Li Weijie got used to having Xia Weiwei around.

Li Weijie's life was now very fulfilling. Under Xia Weiwei's "tutoring," he was busy from the moment he woke up until he went to bed at night.

But despite being busy, he was very excited. Recently, there had been tremendous changes in all aspects of his life, not only surprising and happy for himself but also making him laugh even when he dreamed. Even Xia Weiwei found this "tutee" unbelievable.

First, Li Weijie's English level improved rapidly. It could be described as "a thousand miles a day" without exaggeration. Recently, Xia Weiwei had nothing left to teach him and even felt a bit inferior.

It was unclear whether it was Xia Weiwei's teaching method or the two of them themselves, but words that he had always struggled to remember could now be remembered after seeing or hearing Xia Weiwei explain them once, and he could even use them flexibly.

Li Weijie described it as English words automatically drilling into his brain, impossible to forget.

In summary, Li Weijie now had over 300,000 words in his vocabulary, making Xia Weiwei, the "teacher," a bit embarrassed.

At the same time, as Li Weijie's grasp of pronunciation improved, his English conversation skills surpassed Xia Weiwei's expectations. Now they were already mixing Chinese and English in their daily conversations.

It was worth mentioning that Li Weijie started imitating Xia Weiwei's pure British English pronunciation to learn English conversation. As a result, not only did Li Weijie's English pronunciation become pure London accent, but he could even imitate Xia Weiwei's pronunciation vividly. The first time Li Weijie mimicked Xia Weiwei speaking at night, he even scared her.

For this reason, Li Weijie was often scolded by "Teacher Xia."

Recently, Xia Weiwei started tutoring him in French, Russian, and Latin. Li Weijie eagerly immersed himself in the ocean of knowledge, greedily absorbing all kinds of knowledge.

At first, Li Weijie only read books related to economics and management. But with his ability to remember everything he saw, he quickly finished reading all the books in Xia Weiwei's dormitory. Finally, he plunged into the library and read everything he could find, from astronomy to geography, economics, literature, medicine, etc.

In just a few days, Li Weijie read thousands of books. Knowledge enriched his mind, and it seemed like a new world had appeared before him.

Secondly, Li Weijie's physical condition underwent earth-shaking changes.

At the age of twenty-something, his height had increased from 180 cm to 182 cm. Originally, their heights were almost the same, but Xia Weiwei's standard figure was 170 cm. Now even if she wore high heels, she only reached his nose.

In addition, the amount of exercise Li Weijie did every day was getting larger. The distance didn't change, but the speed kept increasing.

Every time he ran, he could clearly feel his body getting lighter and faster, almost flying. And after running, not only did he not get out of breath or tired, but he felt more energetic. It wasn't until people started looking at him strangely that he had been intentionally controlling his emotions and slowing down his running speed for a month to avoid being considered a monster.

Besides, Li Weijie's body had some other changes that he didn't think about and ignored.

Chapter 18: Heartbeat

That afternoon, Li Weijie received a call from Xia Weiwei telling him not to wait for her in the study room but to go home directly for dinner.

Li Weijie habitually packed up his things at 5:30 and left school to go home. Now he seemed to have forgotten about looking for a job, but was instead immersed in the ocean of knowledge.

As soon as he entered the house, he heard a "clang clang" sound coming from the kitchen door in the dining room. He walked over and peeked inside, seeing that Xia Weiwei was cooking. So he went to her back and lightly patted her shoulder, saying, "Weiwei Sister! I'm home."

"Ah! You..."

Xia Weiwei threw down the frying pan and instinctively jumped to one side. Seeing it was Li Weijie, she lightly stroked her chest with her left hand and then shouted at him, "Are you trying to scare me to death!"

She raised her right hand with the cooking spatula and chased after Li Weijie, pretending to hit him.

Of course, Li Weijie was smart enough to use the first strategy in the Thirty-Six Stratagems. When Xia Weiwei chased him to the dining room door, he had already escaped back into his room and peeked out from the crack in the door, smiling at the furious lioness.

Xia Weiwei was just about to chase after him and hit him hard when she suddenly sniffed. The smell of burnt food reminded her that the pot on the stove and its contents were still there. She exclaimed, "Oh no! My food..."

She then screamed as she rushed back to the kitchen.

Li Weijie went into his room, put down his backpack, changed clothes, washed his hands and face, then came to the dining room.

Just then, Xia Weiwei carried that slightly burnt dish from the kitchen into the dining room. From her wide eyes, it was clear she still had a lot of anger.

Li Weijie wasn't stupid. He quickly lowered his head and said, "Weiwei Sister, you've worked so hard! Haha, I...I didn't mean to scare you just now. It was just a joke..."

Xia Weiwei put the dish on the table and raised her hand to give Li Weijie a slap on the head, saying, "Not mean? Not mean, you walked so quietly? Not mean, you..."

The more she said, the angrier she got. She raised her hand to hit Li Weijie again, but he quickly covered his head and begged, "Weiwei Sister, spare me. You're so magnanimous, forgive your little brother this time!"

"Sparing you is fine..."

Xia Weiwei snorted and said, "Alright, come here first."

Watching Li Weijie slowly move closer, Xia Weiwei pointed at the slightly burnt dish on the table and smiled, "Eat this whole plate of food, and I'll pretend nothing happened."

"No problem, no problem..."

Li Weijie quickly agreed, gesturing and looking very funny.

"Weiwei, you eat first. I'll go get the soup."

Xia Weiwei said as she walked to the kitchen.

Li Weijie sat at the table, turned around and saw Xia Weiwei's busy figure through the half-open door. He felt a warmth in his heart.

Since Xia Weiwei came to his house, besides strictly demanding him to study, she did everything for him. It was so natural and without any hesitation or complaints. She turned this originally cold house into a warm home.

Every morning, Xia Weiwei woke Li Weijie up, prepared breakfast and study materials for him. Almost every night she prepared dinner and snacks for him, even washing his clothes a few times...

Xia Weiwei's care for Li Weijie in life was meticulous, far exceeding the responsibilities that classmates or even friends should bear. It was more like a mother, sister, or wife...

Li Weijie looked at Xia Weiwei's slender back and was completely captivated. He didn't realize she had already walked out of the kitchen with a large bowl of soup.

Xia Weiwei felt his strange gaze and didn't say anything. She softly called him to eat.

They chatted while eating, and Li Weijie accidentally saw some redness on Xia Weiwei's left hand. His heart suddenly trembled, and he quickly put down his chopsticks and grabbed Xia Weiwei's left hand.

"Ah!"

Xia Weiwei was scared by Li Weijie's action and softly cried out.

Li Weijie held Xia Weiwei's injured left hand, slowly bringing it close to his eyes. He saw that on her delicate white hand was a red and swollen area about an inch in diameter, with a pea-sized blister in the middle.

He looked up at her and asked doubtfully.

"Nothing, it doesn't hurt anymore. Just now..."

Xia Weiwei knew what he was going to ask and didn't let him finish his question.

"Jus now?"

Li Weijie suddenly remembered his prank and the things he had thought of while daydreaming. His heart skipped a beat, and his body trembled.

Xia Weiwei also felt his heartbeat. Looking at him holding her hand, she wanted to take it back but was stopped by his fingers when she tried.

Li Weijie looked into her eyes and murmured softly, "Weiwei Sister, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry..."

Besides 'I'm sorry', Li Weijie seemed to know nothing else to say, as if he had a thousand words but didn't know how to express them.

Neither of them knew what they were thinking, or if they were thinking anything at all. They just stared at each other.

Li Weijie seemed to suddenly think of something and stood up abruptly, gently put her hand back on the table, and quickly left the dining room.

Before Xia Weiwei could react, Li Weijie had already returned with a first-aid kit in his hand.

Li Weijie sat back down, opened the first-aid kit and took out disinfectant, burn ointment, bandages, and adhesive tape. He gently held her hand again and carefully applied the medicine and bandaged it.

When he finished, Li Weijie held her hand as if holding a national treasure and kissed the bandage on her hand lightly. He looked up at her eyes.

Xia Weiwei saw Li Weijie kiss the back of her hand. Her beautiful eyes silently filled with moisture.

Although she blushed when he gently kissed the back of her hand, this time she didn't avoid his gaze or pull away. She just looked at him silently.

Neither of them said a word, but they both knew what the other wanted to say and was thinking. It seemed that words were unnecessary at this moment.

Afterwards, neither of them mentioned what had happened. The daily arrangements and things they did remained the same.

But their looks at each other and the tone of their words had changed. In fact, both of their hearts had changed, but it could also be said that they hadn't changed.

They just confirmed one thing: their hearts were closer now.

Chapter 19: Astonishment

In the morning, Xia Weiwei got up early and pushed open Li Weijie's door for the first time to enter his room in the morning.

Xia Weiwei walked to Li Weijie's bed, sat lightly beside him and gently pushed his body while calling out softly, "Weiwei, wake up! Weiwei, get up!"

Li Weijie obediently opened his eyes and sat up. Xia Weiwei looked at him tenderly, saw that he was awake, and didn't say anything more. She turned around and went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast for him.

After he washed up, dressed, and finished his meal like a whirlwind, Xia Weiwei smiled as she sent him out. But he suddenly grabbed her hand that was injured yesterday and kissed it lightly.

Looking at Li Weijie's back as he walked away in the morning sun, Xia Weiwei smiled contentedly.

Now Li Weijie didn't need to get up early for studying, but he kept the habit of getting up to exercise. However, now he didn't go to school anymore but went to the nearby River Park.

After exercising, Li Weijie would casually go to the public reading room to read the newspaper and look for a job he could do.
