A woman’s face can be made up to compensate, but her figure is something that cannot be concealed. Observing this saleswoman, she was quite attractive, but her figure was even more outstanding, especially a pair of long and graceful legs. Wearing a short skirt, her legs appeared even more slender, while the flesh-colored stockings added an element of allure. Li Weijie’s mind suddenly conjured a rather lecherous thought, imagining what it would be like if she wore sheer black stockings. With this in mind, Li Weijie deliberately leaned closer to her and whispered into her ear: “Miss, you are also very beautiful. When would be a good time for us to go out and play together?”

Li Weijie’s lips were very close to her ear, so close that his breath was touching the sensitive area of her earlobe. He deliberately made the word “play” sound quite ambiguous, with a hint of flirtation.

Wang Yan originally thought she would detest Li Weijie’s actions, but surprisingly, she did not feel any dislike; rather, there was a hint of excitement and anticipation. The stimulation from the sensitive area near her ear made her feel somewhat exhilarated. She secretly thought to herself that she lacked composure, but women are indeed women; even if they want something in their hearts, they would still maintain a certain reserve on the surface.

“Excuse me sir, please pay attention to your behavior…”

Li Weijie did not get angry at her words but shifted his gaze to her prominent bust and looked at her name tag: “You are Wang Yan.”

Wang Yan felt somewhat exposed under Li Weijie’s intense gaze, as if she was not wearing any clothes at all. She quickly stepped back to maintain a distance of one meter from Li Weijie and said: “Yes, sir. If you have made your selection, I will leave now.”

Once a man’s mind wanders, it is hard to adjust back quickly. So once Li Weijie took the first step, he would not stop teasing Wang Yan. He quickly found an excuse: “Wait a moment, Wang Yan, please bring me that dark-colored set of clothes. I want to try it on.”

Customers are kings, and Wang Yan brought the clothes back while Li Weijie had already entered the fitting room.

Li Weijie took the clothes Wang Yan passed through the door crack and deliberately let out a soft exclamation: “This one is defective…”

Wang Yan, upon hearing this, entered the fitting room to check it out. She carefully examined Li Weijie’s clothes but did not find any defects.

To avoid making a mistake, Wang Yan slightly bent down to check more closely. This movement allowed Li Weijie to clearly see the color of her underwear, black—a wild and passionate hue. More exciting was Wang Yan’s unusually full breasts, which seemed eager to break free from the tight bra. Half of her breast was exposed, white with a hint of pink, and men clearly think with their lower bodies. Seeing such allure made Li Weijie feel a surge of heat in his lower body. Sometimes, the direct view is not as stimulating as peeping, but it can quickly arouse desire.

Li Weijie suddenly wanted to do something. In this small fitting room, there was hardly any distance between them. He kicked the door gently with his foot and locked it. Just as Wang Yan was about to explain that there were no defects in the clothes, Li Weijie swiftly embraced her and kissed her lips.

Wang Yan did not expect Li Weijie to be so bold, kissing her in such a place. She wanted to resist but felt weak all over, with an electrifying sensation that was both stimulating and exciting. She wanted to call out but her mouth was completely covered by Li Weijie’s kiss, and even more annoyingly, he extended his tongue to tease her lips. Wang Yan’s little tongue darted around but was eventually cornered and had no choice but to submit.

Wang Yan never imagined that being kissed would feel so wonderful. She realized for the first time that the taste of saliva was sweet and had an electric sensation. Although she knew she was being kissed without her consent, she did not resist at all. She continuously pounded Li Weijie’s shoulders with her soft fists, but the blows were weak.

Gradually, she stopped resisting and even began to comply. Her beautiful eyes slowly closed, enjoying this wonderful sensation.

Li Weijie originally just wanted to take advantage of the situation. After all, it was their first encounter; if she reported him, things would get complicated. But unexpectedly, the kiss felt very pleasant, and it seemed she was enjoying it too.

His actions became more brazen. His hands began to wander, from her waist down to her rounded buttocks, the sensation was intense and fresh. This was the taste and stimulation brought by a different woman.

Li Weijie felt the smooth, delicate skin beneath the thin fabric and even more so, the subtle friction between their legs…

Wang Yan could smell his masculine scent as he touched her. The friction on her chest gave her an electrifying sensation, and she could feel his arousal below.

Wang Yan’s heart raced faster, a blush creeping onto her cheeks. She softly called out in her mind that it was not right but felt as if she had lost control of her body.

Li Weijie’s lower body pressed firmly against Wang Yan’s soft abdomen. This beautiful young woman, wearing black and sexy underwear for the first time they met, brought a unique feeling of conquest.

With her mouth covered by Li Weijie’s kiss, Wang Yan seemed to lose herself.

Li Weijie pressed his lower body tightly against her private area. Gradually, she gave up resistance and slowly began to kiss back.

Wang Yan extended her small tongue to savor the lingering sweetness of their kiss, that electrifying sensation throughout her body.

Li Weijie then freed his hand and caressed her slender waist, gently massaging her firm breasts with just the right amount of pressure.

Wang Yan had never been touched by any man before. She knew even if she wanted to resist now, it would be impossible; her body was weak and tingling.

Li Weijie’s hard member boldly invaded Wang Yan’s sacred territory, rubbing shamelessly. The occasional contact with her most sensitive spot made her involuntarily moan.

Wang Yan’s body became softer, even embracing Li Weijie’s neck to show her desire and excitement.

In the small fitting room, they entwined passionately. Li Weijie greedily tasted her sweet saliva and caressed her full breasts, his lower body movements becoming more intense. Their breathing grew increasingly rapid…

Wang Yan emitted a heart-stirring, repressed moan from her throat. Li Weijie’s blood was boiling; he wanted it, intensely craving it. Although that morning he had been with Xia Weiwei a few times and ejaculated under the stimulating feet of Huang Ying in the meeting room, Li Weijie finally realized that he was completely immune to sexual desire and his abilities were becoming stronger.

Wang Yan’s skin was so smooth, her breasts so elastic. Li Weijie undid her blouse to reveal the white cleavage and black lace bra.

Li Weijie pulled Wang Yan’s bra up over her breasts with force, greedily sucking on the two buds like a child, trying to extract sweet milk for himself. Li Weijie, who had never enjoyed mother’s milk as a child, indeed had this inclination.

As Li Weijie sucked, his other hand slid down to her flat and smooth abdomen, unbuttoning her skirt and pulling the zipper. He tried to remove the tight short skirt from her body.

Wang Yan knew Li Weijie’s desire and hope. Her body moved weakly, and this movement only increased Li Weijie’s excitement and desire.

Li Weijie’s hand touched her small underpants, which were slightly damp. Wang Yan’s entire body trembled; she was about to lose herself… She gently lifted her buttocks, seeking that soul-stirring sensation…

Li Weijie’s hand continued to explore inside the thin underpants, searching for that patch of grassland, that forbidden zone, that paradise. Although his fingers were trembling, they moved nimbly. Just as Li Weijie touched that moist crevice, Shen Momen’s voice suddenly rang out from outside the door, pulling them back from their ocean of desire.

“Wei Jie, are you done?”

Wang Yan quickly pushed Li Weijie away. Li Weijie took a deep breath and answered: “Done.”

“I will come back for you.”

He gently touched Wang Yan’s chest, opened the door slightly, and walked out while softly closing it.

**Chapter 18: Clouds of Beautiful Women**

When Shen Momen walked up to Li Weijie, a faint elegant fragrance wafted over. What brand of perfume was this?

Shen Momen had added a little makeup, making her even more radiant. What attracted Li Weijie the most were her moist red lips; when she applied lipstick, that dazzling smile became even more enchanting. At this moment, if he could kiss her, he would gladly shorten his life by ten years.

As Shen Momen passed Li Weijie, he noticed that the dress she was wearing seemed familiar, as if it had been featured in a fashion magazine. It appeared to be the latest design from Paris Fashion Week, a black evening gown with straps that tied into a bow at the back of her neck. With just a gentle pull, the entire dress would slip off, an exquisite and seductive design.

Shen Momen’s delicate shoulders and smooth back were exposed without any cover, most intriguingly, the straps of her bra could not be seen. Could it be that she was wearing nothing underneath?

Li Weijie carefully observed the low-cut neckline and found two full, white mounds. The sexy lace bra that had been covering them was nowhere to be seen.

So, the two peaks she now saw were real. Li Weijie exclaimed internally: “Wow! This is the goddess of my dreams!”

Shen Momen was also pleased with Li Weijie. They entered the elevator together, preparing to go downstairs and get their car.

The elevator arrived, and Li Weijie walked in ahead of Shen Momen. Indeed, heaven rewards those with perseverance; Shen Momen stood in front of him, and the scent from her smooth back made Li Weijie exceptionally excited.

He secretly glanced at the bottom of her exposed back, a tantalizing design that revealed the elastic band of her underpants.

This sensation almost made Li Weijie’s nostrils bleed, reminding him of the lace underpants he had seen his mother-in-law Su Yuya wear in the bathroom. My heavens! Why are women’s underpants so mysterious…

Li Weijie was still immersed in these thoughts when they reached the car.

Donglai City, Nan District Huijia. This district was where the wealthy gathered, with land prices so high it could be considered priceless per inch. High-end restaurants, bars, top-notch clubs, five-star hotels, high-end business centers, fashion boutiques, fitness and entertainment centers were all concentrated here. Anyone you might bump into on the street could be worth over a hundred million. Huijia District was a symbol of status, the dream destination for millions in Zhonghai City. It was paradise for the wealthy, where mansions, luxury cars, and beautiful women were随处可见，只要你有足够的挥霍的钱，这里就会热烈地拥抱你，吸纳你成为富豪俱乐部的一员。前提是你是否拥有上亿的财富。

Li Weijie never imagined that the inspection location would be at the Mulan Club. This club was a social gathering place for successful people and some wealthy individuals, with an entry fee of $16,000. It was known as one of the top five clubs in Zhonghai City alongside Tian Shang Renjian, Tie Xue, Banker’s Club, and Securities Association.

The entrance of the Mulan Club was filled with luxury cars, including a Pagani Zonda. Each Zonda delivered to customers had unique open-top charm and powerful performance, with a handcrafted quality that made them prestigious. The most exaggerated feature was that all Pagani models were considered supercars, with even the entry model boasting 500 horsepower. Each Pagani was limited production, and it could take nine months to a year for delivery.

Currently, there were only three Zondas on the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. According to Pagani’s plan, a total of six right-hand drive models would be produced, with Hong Kong receiving three shares. One owner was a Hong Kong tycoon who made his fortune from manufacturing "cabbage dolls" and became known as the "Toy King," Cai Zhiming, who was also the first Asian Pagani owner.

The owner of this Zonda was rumored to be the founder of the Mulan Club, a mysterious woman said to have ties with a European royal family. How else could she own such an esteemed Pagani?

The club was brightly lit, with a spacious and luxurious hall adorned in opulence yet retaining an elegant grandeur. The marble floor gleamed, the large chandeliers casting a brilliant light, and soothing music filled the air.

A long table adorned with flowers held various delicacies for guests to help themselves, while ladies in fitted qipaos carried trays of drinks穿梭于宾客之间。

The men were dressed in suits and appeared courteous, while the women wore elegant evening gowns. These men and women whispered softly or laughed merrily, some more active, mingling and displaying their social skills. Yet, everyone’s smiles were somewhat reserved and artificial, typical of the upper class party scene.

Li Weijie and Shen Momen entered the club gracefully, blending into the hall.

“Momen, is it really you?”

A slightly surprised voice sounded beside him. Li Weijie looked up and was immediately captivated by a beautiful woman in a red embroidered qipao, her face as delicate as flowers and her figure curvaceous. She was chatting with Shen Momen, but her flirtatious gaze kept darting to Li Weijie. “When did you come back? Who is this?”

“This is my assistant, Li Weijie. Wei Jie, this is…”

Shen Momen looked at the beautiful woman and smiled sweetly. Li Weijie was captivated, staring admiringly into her eyes. Before Shen Momen could finish introducing her, he said with a smile: “Minister Shen, I know. This must be your sister; she is so beautiful…”

Both women were taken aback, Shen Momen rolled her eyes, and the woman couldn’t help but giggle, almost breathless: “Momen, this young man is quite amusing. He calls me sister? Haha…”

Shen Momen held the woman’s hand and gave Li Weijie a look, saying: “What are you talking about? Aunt Song, he…”

Li Weijie realized his mistake and quickly corrected himself: “Sister, this qipao is truly exquisite. It makes you look like a celestial being.”

Qin Keqing really laughed, she had forgotten how long it was since she last smiled like this. Qin Keqing originally thought Li Weijie was Shen Momen’s boyfriend, but seeing his attire and how he addressed her, she realized she had been mistaken.

Women always have endless topics to discuss. Li Weijie couldn’t join in and was distracted, looking around.

Not far away, a sound of admiration echoed. Li Weijie followed the sound and felt his breath catch as he marveled at the sight.

Three stunning women approached, everyone making way for them. The three wore long dresses in black, red, and white, each with their own charm. An Bi Ru was dressed in a fiery red gown, the high collar revealing a deep cleavage and half of her snow-white breasts, making hearts flutter.

Xu Qing wore a black strapless gown that almost slipped off her shoulders, revealing ivory skin and soft shoulders. Her full breasts and translucent figure made many men’s noses bleed.

Song Su Xiang was less flamboyant but wore a white gown that showcased her smooth back and graceful figure, exuding an ethereal beauty. Her skin was as pure as snow, like a goddess, beautiful and untouchable.

If An Bi Ru embodied the charm of a mature woman, Xu Qing was the allure of an experienced one. Song Su Xiang was gentle and somewhat coldly beautiful, full yet slender, a perfect wife and mother, elegant and refined.

The three women were more magnificent than the last, men’s eyes never leaving them while women envied and felt inferior.

---

The Mulan Club was indeed one of the top clubs in Donglai City, where women were more beautiful than the last. Li Weijie felt familiar with some of them; he had been intimate with An Bi Ru before, though he was drunk and didn’t remember much. He still had a vague impression of her.

Li Weijie did not immediately recognize An Bi Ru, but he instantly recognized Xu Qing. Her full and prominent breasts left a deep impression on him, as did her long, shapely legs and sexy lace underwear.

As for Song Su Xiang, yes, she seemed familiar. Where had he seen her before? Li Weijie frowned slightly, staring at the three women intently.

An Bi Ru’s graceful steps faltered as she saw Li Weijie, her face flushing red; Xu Qing glared at him with a challenging look; Song Su Xiang felt familiar but couldn’t recall where.

What are you looking at? Hmph, seeing a beautiful woman makes him stop in his tracks! Shen Momen thought resentfully, Huang Ying had similar thoughts.

Women understand women best.

---

Just then, melodious music filled the hall as couples entered the dance floor hand in hand.

Qin Keqing winked suggestively and said to Li Weijie: “Wei Jie, why don’t you invite Momen to dance?”

Li Weijie felt his blood boil as he looked at Shen Momen’s full breasts and smooth back, her cleavage deep.

When Qin Keqing asked him to invite Shen Momen to dance, she smiled generously and gave him an encouraging look.

Li Weijie immediately walked up to Shen Momen with grace, formally inviting her to dance.

Suddenly, from in front of Shen Momen, he saw the two snow-white mounds of her breasts and the deep cleavage. His eyes were glued to them.

As Shen Momen accepted with a gentle lift of her arm, the two full mounds swayed even more.

In an instant! Li Weijie’s blood rushed to his head, his face flushed, heart racing. A heat surged from his lower abdomen, and if he hadn’t taken a deep breath, he might have blushed right there.

“Minister Shen, may I have this dance?”

Li Weijie extended his gentlemanly hand.

“Mm.”

Shen Momen glanced at him, then smiled sweetly and slowly placed her hand on his warm one.

Li Weijie was captivated by her alluring eyes.

A soft giggle from Qin Keqing snapped him out of his daze.

As Li Weijie and Shen Momen entered the dance floor, all eyes were on them.

**Chapter 19: Seductive Dance**

Shen Momen’s full breasts swayed on her slender curves, the hem of her dress revealing a pair of snow-white legs. The red high heels lifted her round buttocks, and her long black hair cascaded down her smooth back. She looked like a fairy from another world.

A man’s status is seen in his enemies, and his taste in the women around him.

When Li Weijie led Shen Momen onto the dance floor, all the men in the hall looked at him with envy. At that moment, Li Weijie deeply felt that a successful man should have a beautiful woman by his side; this saying was truly classic.

The lights dimmed, and romantic music played.

In a romantic atmosphere, Li Weijie gently pulled Shen Momen into his arms. He gazed at her alluring eyes, bashful and playful expression, and moist red lips, like a spring of water in the desert, quenching his thirst.

He smelled her scent and felt her smooth skin under his hands. Her full breasts pressed against him, experiencing the five senses—sight, smell, touch, and thought—all at once. He was truly intoxicated in a silent yet profound state.

---

Being able to intimately touch Shen Momen, this beautiful woman, was something Li Weijie never imagined. They were two parallel lines that should have never intersected, but fate and love brought them together. It seemed Li Weijie, the toad, might actually get a taste of swan meat.

Two soft yet firm mounds pressed against Li Weijie’s chest as they danced. As he moved, he secretly pushed his chest forward onto her full breasts and looked at the smooth back. If he slid his hand down, he could easily touch her elastic band, but Li Weijie dared not be too bold, fearing he might startle the little lamb in his arms.

Li Weijie’s mind was still clear. Shen Momen was beautiful, but she was also his superior and the only daughter of a billionaire. These were things he had to consider, unlike Wang Yan in the clothing store. Although he was worried about her, it wouldn’t cause much trouble, so he could enjoy the moment. If Shen Momen hadn’t appeared suddenly, he might have already taken advantage of that delicate cabbage.

Holding Shen Momen in his arms as they danced, Li Weijie couldn’t help but think of Lin Yixing. They had once danced together and participated in a provincial sports dance competition, winning a good ranking.

That was during his third year of university. Lin Yixing had just gotten her hair done, a shoulder-length bob that moved like invisible strings in the wind.

On the night of the final, they were also awarded. When their ranking was announced, Li Weijie excitedly hugged her, and Lin Yixing threw herself into his arms.

That moment of excitement lingered in their minds, until they returned backstage to a makeshift dressing room. Another pair of winners were passionately kissing.

That couple’s actions suddenly sparked Lin Yixing’s desire to make a mistake. Since their first encounter in the wilderness, she had prepared for it. Lin Yixing felt herself in a state of excitement and pleasure, giving Li Weijie an ambiguous but alluring smile.

Li Weijie stood beside her without leaving. The scent and sweat from Lin Yixing’s body, the thin dance outfit barely covering her, the short skirt not fully straightened, revealing a small patch of fabric on her full abdomen—all made him uneasy. It was like a blue whale rising from the depths, ready to break through.

Li Weijie was already familiar with Lin Yixing’s body from dancing. The frequent contact during Latin dance, especially the sensitive areas fitting together, made it common for dancers to be couples or married.

In this small space, Lin Yixing had no reservations as a girlfriend. She casually took off her makeup and changed clothes in front of him, turning to reveal her back with a row of small buttons on the back of her blouse.

Lin Yixing softly said: “Wei Jie, can you help me unbutton the back?”

As Li Weijie undid her buttons, he secretly peeked at Lin Yixing’s back, which was smooth and bare.

The straps of her blouse slipped off, revealing her full breasts. She reached for a rose-red bra with lace trim from the bag beside her feet, raised one arm, and bent her head. Her tightly tied hair loosened as she put on the bra and began combing her hair, her firm breasts moving rhythmically with each stroke of the brush.

Their eyes met in the mirror. He felt his heart racing, his body burning with desire, wanting to place his hand on her waist and gently caress her full buttocks.

Lin Yixing winked at him in the mirror, then stood up and adjusted her skirt. She hesitated for a moment but did not take off her pants in front of him.

Li Weijie didn’t let this opportunity slip. He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind and kissed her, making Lin Yixing tremble with excitement. Her face turned red as she wriggled out of his embrace, teasingly circling her lips and sticking out her tongue.

Lin Yixing’s hand slipped into his shirt, stroking his firm chest and breathing in the scent of sweat from his skin. It was intoxicating.

Her moist, warm lips like a flower bud attracted him; Li Weijie boldly thrust his tongue inside. Their tongues intertwined, like fine silk.

One hand massaged her breasts隔着薄薄的胸罩用力揉搓，另一只手滑到了她的大腿上部，她的身上逐渐有了异样的感觉，肉体的喜悦突如其来。

Li Weijie的手又往下滑，沿着她内裤的边缘抚摸到了她的那一处，那里粘霜带露贴着纠作一团，芳草萋萋。

林逸欣受不了这样的挑逗，一个屁股扭摆得风情万种，竟伸出一双纤纤织手朝李伟杰胯间摸去，双手忙乱地在他的腰间摸索，急急的想要解开他的腰带，却事与愿违，半天都没有弄开……

最后，是李伟杰把自己将裤子脱了，连同内裤一并褪到了膝盖处，林逸欣的脸红了，那东西看上去太得吓人，李伟杰已是淫兴如炽，鼻孔滋滋地喘着粗气，就把个身子往前凑，掀开她的身子仰躺落在椅子的靠背上，也没脱下她的内裤，只在那窄小的底里一滑，掰开她一双大腿，趁水带滑孜孜的舞弄进去，刚挨近她的肉瓣时觉得艰窄滞涩，扭摆着腰一连几推才挺进了龟头。

林逸欣香汗如珠肌肤战栗，紧锁着双眉强忍着，李伟杰研研塞塞地插进一大半，恰好那龟头搠着了她鸡冠似的那一地方，像鸡啄食一般连顶乱插。

她哪里曾受到这样的逗弄，伸手探到了李伟杰的胯下，还有小半的一节还在外面，只好努力扩张开双腿，再把那烦人的内裤撩向一边。

李伟杰也知道这意思，把她两只脚踝用手扑在旁边，身子朝前一拱，挺身一耸，林逸欣一声惊呼：“啊唷！”

她撑起双手把紧了他的臂膀，李伟杰再捞起她的屁股搂紧了，一连几耸，尽根陷没。

李伟杰没梭没脑尽根抽顶，弄得林逸欣一个人魂魄飞舞欲仙欲死一般，那一处鲜嫩的地方酸麻酥利，洋洋酸软，再见她半卧半仰躺在椅子上，两只白腿高攀朝天一晃一晃地摇摆，倒也觉得趣味横生，再加大一把劲，她那地方水声唧唧响动，像是开了闸的水渠，一张小嘴微启着娇啼婉转哀鸣不止，也把他逗弄得淫兴狂发春情难遏，一根东西更是奋起大抽大送尽情施为，来来往往频频骤骤连连尽根。

那张并不结实的椅子承受不了两个人这般的折腾，早就咯吱咯吱地发出了抗议，看来摇摇欲坠。

很快地李伟杰便泄出了精液，他是在林逸欣一阵高昂激动的叫唤中泄出的，宣泄时的快感让他头昏目眩，浑身酥麻，也让林逸欣终于筋疲力竭瘫在椅子上，随着快乐的余韵犹存，她的身体仍不时微微震颤，似在贪享情爱余味。

---

Li Weijie withdrew his hands from her, reluctantly moving up to massage her breasts. Just touching them made him feel how firm and soft they were; he squeezed them hard, then pulled her back into his arms, waiting for the afterglow of her climax to subside.

As they got dressed, Lin Yixing was still enveloped in happiness, even though the passion had subsided.

Li Weijie saw his member still dripping with semen as he pulled up his pants, that part which had explored every detail of this woman’s soul-stirring body seemed to be积蓄着力量，准备再次交欢。

Outside the hallway was quiet, only dim streetlights glowing. A sense of heaviness and transcendence descended upon him as another cheerful melody played, pulling her out of the mysterious allure.

---

“Ah…”

Shen Momen let out a soft exclamation, her eyes filled with a mix of surprise and displeasure. In just a few minutes, he had stepped on her foot several times; she had been generous in the past but this time it really hurt.

Li Weijie snapped out of his reverie and saw Shen Momen’s head tilt towards him, her lips slightly parted as she whispered: “Did you do it on purpose?”

“No, not really…”

He smelled her scent and felt the fullness of her breasts against his chest. Li Weijie’s desire kept rising.

“I dance quite well, just…”

Li Weijie tried to lift his hips to avoid stepping on her sensitive area but found that his lower body was already rebellious, pressing forward. It seemed he couldn’t hold it back.

“Just what?”

Shen Momen looked at Li Weijie’s slightly flushed face with interest, her eyebrows furrowed again as she realized he had stepped on her foot once more.

Li Weijie leaned close to Shen Momen’s ear and boldly said: “You are just too beautiful.”

Shen Momen blushed slightly, giggling and saying: “Wei Jie, I find you to be rather honest-looking. You are actually quite flirtatious.”

“Momen, I am telling the truth…”

Li Weijie was afraid Shen Momen would misunderstand him as being lecherous, so he said: “Because you are so beautiful, I hope you can understand. It’s a normal male reaction.”

“Invade me?”

Shen Momen looked at Li Weijie with a strange expression: “Wei Jie, what do you mean by invading?”

Li Weijie boldly pushed his lower body against her hips, touching the sensitive area between them. Shen Momen gasped and lowered her head in embarrassment.

“Momen, I was afraid you would think me lecherous, so I tried to lift my hips to avoid touching your sensitive area…”

Li Weijie whispered in Shen Momen’s ear: “But now it is unavoidable. To avoid being seen by others, I hope you can cover for me.”

Shen Momen’s breathing quickened. Li Weijie thought she was nervous.

“Wei Jie, what… should I say…”

Shen Momen blushed and lowered her head.

Li Weijie was nervous, not sure if he would scare her. But his desire had risen to the point where he decided to take a chance.

Li Weijie pushed forward, pressing his lower body against Shen Momen’s hips. The two fit perfectly together.

“Ah…”

Shen Momen let out a soft cry,幸好旁边有音乐声相伴，要不然这个叫声可尴尬了。

“Momen, I hope you can cover for me so no one sees this.”

Li Weijie was nervous, watching Shen Momen’s reaction. He feared she would get angry and make a scene.

“Mm…”

Shen Momen blushed, her voice soft as a mosquito. Thankfully, the situation did not turn out as badly as Li Weijie imagined.

---

Since Shen Momen tacitly allowed Li Weijie’s invasion, he pressed his lower body against her sensitive area as much as possible. Although there were several layers of fabric, he could still feel the sensation from her petals, a moment unforgettable.

“Huh…”

Shen Momen’s breathing quickened, her lips slightly panting, and her eyes filled with a hint of allure.

Li Weijie hugged Shen Momen tighter, rubbing his chest against her bare mounds. Although there were two thin layers of fabric, the lack of a bra made him feel as if her full breasts were bare against his chest. Li Weijie closed his eyes, enjoying this soul-stirring moment.

For the first time, someone touched her untouched area. Shen Momen seemed to be uncomfortable and began to grip his clothes tightly, no longer just resting her hands. Her breathing also quickened. Looking at her moist red lips, Li Weijie couldn’t resist and kissed her.

“Ah…”

Shen Momen let out a soft cry as Li Weijie’s lips were about to touch hers, but she avoided it.

Then, her hips moved slightly backward as if trying to avoid his lower body. He didn’t dare push her back with his hands, so he waited anxiously to see what would happen. Did she get scared? Or was she angry at his boldness?

After the music stopped, Shen Momen quickly led Li Weijie back to their seats. Her actions indicated that she did not want to continue dancing, crushing any chance Li Weijie had of proposing again.

Shen Momen’s actions were like a bucket of cold water, dousing Li Weijie’s desire. Considering her high status, he felt disheartened.

---

Li Weijie sat in a quiet corner, sipping his drink. After dancing with Shen Momen, she left him there and hurried away.

Seeing how rushed Shen Momen was, her steps somewhat unsteady, Li Weijie mocked himself: “Am I really a toad wanting to eat swan meat?”

If Li Weijie had gone with Shen Momen, he would have discovered that she was not going to see an important person but heading to the restroom.
