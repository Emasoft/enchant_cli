Sitting cross-legged, Li Weijie followed the heart method of the second level of the Fist Scripture, slowly regulating his internal energy. His physical strength gradually became full and he was filled with vitality throughout his body.

Half an hour later, Li Weijie finished his practice and opened his eyes. A flash of sharp light passed by, the room was dark all around, he reached out and turned on the bedside lamp.

Li Weijie stood up, took his change of clothes, and walked towards the bathroom outside the room.

After washing himself thoroughly, he changed into his clothes, put away the blood-stained clothes, and walked out of the bathroom feeling refreshed.

Returning to the room, Li Weijie found Xia Weiwei sitting on his bed. She was holding a medicine box and had changed into her nightwear. Her tall figure exuded an elegant demeanor, with her black and lustrous hair cascading over her shoulders. Her clear eyes were filled with affection, her rosy lips were vividly red, and a blush tinged her fair face. A smile was naturally present in the corners of her eyes, and a hint of emotion lingered beside her pretty face.

Her figure was indescribably beautiful. A pair of plump and pointed breasts lifted her proud chest, a smooth and delicate abdomen adorned with a slender waist, and a full and rounded buttocks outlined a perfect myth. All of this was covered by a black lace, pink see-through nightgown that revealed her alluring figure vaguely.

Knowing that Xia Weiwei was worried about him, Li Weijie felt touched in his heart. Without her calling out to him, he walked over and sat down beside her on the bed.

Xia Weiwei took out some medicine water, carefully applying it to him. Li Weijie only had a few minor scratches that did not cause much pain, but since the beauty was so concerned, he gladly accepted it.

Her alluring body was vaguely visible under her sexy nightgown. She wore a white bra with the upper part semi-transparent and lace edges without straps, forming a deep cleavage. The enticing cleavage was so deep that the patterns of her bra were vaguely visible on both sides, and the plump breasts rose and fell slightly in the small cups. Unfortunately, the buds under the bra were not visible. Due to her sitting posture, the hem of the nightgown gathered at her thigh roots, revealing her long and slender legs, with a black pair of panties vaguely visible.

Li Weijie felt his body heat up inadvertently from just one glance, and his body reacted. His face turned slightly red, so to divert his attention, he started talking incessantly.

“Weiwei姐, you’re so good. Hehe, I will work hard and earn money to repay your great kindness to me. In the future, when we have children…”

“Pfft, what ‘in the future when we have children’…”

Li Weijie continued his speech滔滔不绝, speaking eloquently. The only listener was initially listening with great interest and excitement, but when he mentioned the last sentence, it seemed to touch a nerve in her. Her face turned red and she interrupted him, giving him a big white eye.

The speechmaker, who was interrupted without warning, looked bewildered and unsurely at the only listener. When he saw her red face and accusing expression, he suddenly understood what she meant by her words and her thoughts. He couldn’t help but cover his stomach with one hand, laughing heartily while pointing at her beside him and saying in a broken voice: “You… hahaha… you… ha… are… too… sensitive, … I didn’t say… haha… that it was ‘in the future with whom we have children’, but if you want to…”

Li Weijie laughed and talked, and after laughing enough, his speech became smoother. However, the latter part of what he said was a bit ambiguous. Although they both knew that they loved each other, neither had broken the ice.

“You… you…讨厌！讨厌！讨厌！…”

Xia Weiwei, blushing with anger, pounced on the culprit, her small fists raining down on him while she kept saying "讨厌" even though she didn’t actually hate him, not even his words just now.

Li Weijie started laughing and pleading with his mouth while pushing away the punches that kept coming at him. Although they didn’t hurt when they hit him, he found them quite comfortable.

He looked at Xia Weiwei and saw her red face with big eyes staring roundly, biting down on her lower lip tightly. To reach him, she leaned forward slightly with her upper body as her arms moved, causing the two high mounds on her chest to bounce enticingly.

This gradually ignited a fire in Li Weijie’s heart, hot and itchy. He felt that Xia Weiwei looked exceptionally beautiful before him.

In a moment of impulse, he suddenly reached out and embraced the girl’s slender waist, pulling her enticing body tightly against his chest.

Xia Weiwei was only thinking of "teaching a lesson" to the man who had made her feel embarrassed and flustered, not noticing that their positions were inappropriate.

She wriggled to try to escape his embrace and lifted her upper body, intending to continue teaching this "annoying" man a lesson. But Li Weijie’s arms were holding her too tightly, so Xia Weiwei’s fists could only rub against his chest like scratching an itch.

As a result, the two of them rolled around on the bed together...

---

**Chapter 009: Sharing a Bed**

Li Weijie and Xia Weiwei rolled around on the bed laughing for quite some time. Perhaps due to exhaustion from their antics, they gradually calmed down.

The battle ended with both sides exhausted and panting. Li Weijie’s breath was heavy, while Xia Weiwei panted softly with sweat glistening on her face.

Earlier by the bedside, Li Weijie had held Xia Weiwei in his arms with her on top and him underneath. But after a while of rolling around, they ended up in the opposite position with Li Weijie on top and Xia Weiwei underneath. They had also rolled into the middle of the bed.

Li Weijie was the first to notice this situation. Seeing that Xia Weiwei had not yet caught her breath, he was happy to hold the lovely body and enjoy the warmth of having a beautiful woman in his arms.

Li Weijie raised his eyes to secretly look at Xia Weiwei beneath him. Her long, black and smooth hair was mostly spread out on the pillow under her head and around her neck. Some strands were stuck to her forehead and temples due to sweat, while a strand hung between her lips, trembling slightly as she exhaled.

Xia Weiwei’s face had been flushed red since earlier and now, due to the sweat, her rosy cheeks shone with a luster that made her look even more beautiful. Her small nostrils fluttered softly as she panted, and especially her full and red lips, which were slightly puckered due to the annoyance from earlier words, looked very sensual. Whenever Li Weijie recalled this scene later on, he would feel a desire to taste them thoroughly.

Although it was still early spring and the weather was cold, the air conditioning kept the room warm. Xia Weiwei wore a sexy lace nightgown that had opened up even more during their struggle and rolling around. From outside, one could see her large expanse of white chest and the lace edges of her bra.

Li Weijie was now very close to Xia Weiwei, looking down from above. He could see much more than usual. After seeing the "peach blossoms on her face," his eyes followed a strand of hair in front of her neck and looked down. The view below was even more beautiful.

Xia Weiwei, who often exercised and took good care of herself, had a full and high chest with snow-white, delicate skin. All this was now for Li Weijie to enjoy, almost making him stare in amazement and drool.

From Li Weijie’s perspective, Xia Weiwei had a round chin, a slender neck, and slightly protruding collarbones. The skin below formed two peaks that were even more prominent. Looking through the open neckline of her nightgown, he could see the double peaks covered by her bra. The cups were lifted high by the protruding breasts, creating an even more alluring valley below, much like how ancient Chinese poetry讲究平仄，有平有仄，平仄相间，诗词咏颂起来才有抑扬顿挫，才更有韵味。

At this moment, Li Weijie suddenly thought of a Hong Kong beauty star, Zhu Yinfen. He had always liked her petite figure and the 35D bust that made her a sexy goddess. Zhu Yinfen was crowned "sexy goddess" when she debuted in 1992 and her curvaceous figure was admired for over a decade. Her natural, firm bust remained unyielding and was called the "unfallen goddess."

However, Zhu Yinfen was a famous movie star while Li Weijie was an unknown college student. Their lives were unlikely to intersect, so his knowledge of Zhu Yinfen was limited to newspapers and television.

Xia Weiwei’s allure at this moment was no less than Zhu Yinfen’s. Li Weijie’s gaze passed over the nightgown, double peaks, and valley to look further down. If not for his own body blocking the light, he might have seen some of her abdomen.

Modern women’s clothing has a trend towards greater exposure from inside out, whether short, narrow, split, or transparent. Designers strive to achieve a teasing effect of "wanting to hide but wanting to show," making women’s clothes more revealing.

Modern women wear less and less, apply heavier makeup, become slimmer, and have larger busts.

Especially women’s lingerie, which is usually only seen by the woman herself and her family. When someone else sees it, she often allows them to see directly without caring about exposure. Therefore, modern lingerie design focuses more on style, color, texture, and physiological needs such as support, lift, and shaping. The function of covering up is almost ignored because it’s not needed.

Li Weijie was nearly mesmerized. His gaze lingered between the double peaks and valley, then suddenly his eyes fixed on something. Today Xia Weiwei was wearing a bra that could kill someone with its allure, a white one with the upper part semi-transparent and lace edges without straps. Normally it could cover important areas, but after their struggle and rolling around, a hint of pink was visible through the gaps. From his perspective, Li Weijie knew what that pink was. Although it was somewhat covered and not very clear, this was enough to shock him.

Xia Weiwei had already recovered from her earlier embarrassment and panting, but she soon found herself in an even more awkward situation. She finally noticed their current position and Li Weijie’s actions, although only his eyes moved around uncontrollably while the rest of him remained still.

She followed his gaze, "Oh! How did I come in wearing this?"

Xia Weiwei exclaimed inwardly and immediately scolded herself for being foolish. If not her own clothes, who else would have put them on? She had been very satisfied with this new set of lingerie when she left the room.

When Xia Weiwei saw where Li Weijie’s gaze had lingered for so long, she gasped and then began to pant even more heavily. Her pulse quickened, making her feel panicked as if she could hear the sound of "thump thump" in her chest, which caused her breasts to tremble with each rise and fall.

Since she grew up, no part of her body had ever been seen by the opposite sex so closely. Now being examined by Li Weijie at such a close distance made Xia Weiwei feel helpless and unsure of what to do. Seeing her breasts rise and fall vigorously, as if she was constantly lifting them for him to admire, and hearing her heart beating so loudly, she wondered if he could hear it.

Xia Weiwei once tried to hold her breath to suppress her panting and heartbeat, but it seemed as if fate was against her. Soon she could no longer bear it, and her panting became even more urgent and rapid, with her heartbeat also quickening.

Forget it! Forget it! In Xia Weiwei’s mind, she conceded and closed her eyes, practicing the "plugging one's ears while stealing a bell" technique.

In fact, her hands had been on the outside of Li Weijie’s shoulders all along. If she pushed him away or covered her neckline, given Li Weijie’s personality and the importance Xia Weiwei held in his heart, he would not have resisted or forced her to continue. Xia Weiwei could have immediately escaped the awkward situation.

However, not only did she not take action, but she lay quietly under Li Weijie with her eyes closed. Her two hands that had been energetically hitting him earlier now lost their strength and lay beside her pillow, in a posture that seemed to welcome guests. This could only be explained by a blank mind and the loss of thinking ability.

In fact, when Xia Weiwei’s heartbeat quickened, Li Weijie noticed the unusualness of the person beneath him. However, the two soft and warm peaks pressing against his chest were already making him enjoy it immensely. As her breasts rose and fell, they pressed against him even more comfortably. Through the elastic parts, he felt the rapid but unstable vibrations of her heartbeat, knowing that she was aware of what she looked like and what he had seen.

Li Weijie really did not want to give up this comfortable experience, but he respected her very much. From the beginning as half-sister and friend to later deep love, Xia Weiwei entered his life when he needed help the most, giving him hope.

So Li Weijie did not want Xia Weiwei to feel even the slightest bit unhappy or wronged.

He raised his head because she did not speak, and Li Weijie had to carefully observe her facial expressions to interpret her thoughts.

He scrutinized every small part and subtle movement on her face meticulously.

The slightly furrowed eyebrows, the tightly closed eyes, trembling eyelashes, quivering nose tip, and flushed cheeks. On her face, he did not see the word "unwilling," only shyness and tension.

Li Weijie saw again those cherries-like lips, full and rosy.

A wave of impulse surged through him, Li Weijie lowered his head to kiss those alluring lips.

Due to excitement in his heart, he did not consider the speed and distance correctly. As a result, when their lips touched, their teeth also wanted to make contact. Unfortunately, the newly intimate lips were blocked by each other’s mouths, and both let out a soft exclamation that was muffled.

When Xia Weiwei first touched lips with him, she opened her tightly closed eyes in surprise and stared roundly at the man who had taken her first kiss without warning. Although she did not disagree and even had a hint of expectation, the pain in her lips made her secretly blame his rashness.

Before Xia Weiwei could fully express her resentment on her face, Li Weijie’s next series of actions stifled it.

Actually, there was a strand of hair by her lips that Li Weijie found somewhat distracting when he stole the "cherries." Since both his hands were holding her waist, she was pressed under him. Without thinking, he used his mouth to clear these misplaced strands.

Li Weijie maintained the kissing posture, opening his mouth to cover her entire cherry lips. He extended his tongue to hook the strand of hair, then closed his lips and shook his head, tossing that strand aside. Then he looked back at Xia Weiwei closely.

Xia Weiwei still maintained her previous posture and expression, staring with wide eyes, slightly parting her small mouth. However, the shyness, joy, anticipation, surprise, and resentment on her face had all disappeared or blended together into a vague expression; there was a small opening between her lips, and traces of moisture on her lip corners and cheeks were evidence of Li Weijie’s tongue invasion.

Li Weijie looked at Xia Weiwei’s face, recalling the quick and somewhat painful kiss. The warmth of her lips lingered on his own, and he smelled the fragrance from her face and hair. He felt the warmth of her breath on his cheeks. As he looked, his self-control gradually diminished until finally, instinctively, he kissed the girl beneath him again.

---

**Chapter 010: Intimacy**

This kiss was not like their first one. They had experience and默契, even though this was only their second kiss.

Li Weijie, as before, used his mouth to cover hers, teasing her lips with his tongue and pressing against Xia Weiwei’s teeth. She understood what he meant and opened her mouth to let this shameless fellow slip into hers, teasing the delicate tongue inside.

After dodging for a while, Xia Weiwei’s tongue also took the initiative to attack, entering his mouth. Their lips and tongues intertwined, truly lip-to-lip, you in me, I in you.

Li Weijie changed from the initial attack and teasing to a defensive stance, sucking her escaping "guerrillas" firmly without letting go, as if he wanted to swallow the invading enemy in one bite.

Not only were their lips and tongues engaged, but their bodies also began to move. Unknowingly, Xia Weiwei’s hands had also embraced Li Weijie, one on his shoulder and the other in his hair at the back of his neck, slowly rubbing without awareness.

Li Weijie’s legs moved slightly, rubbing against her legs; their four feet played hide-and-seek. His two hands holding her waist slowly moved, his left hand drawing circles on her back and gradually expanding the range to occasionally caress her buttocks, finally stopping at the raised part behind. Through the thin nightgown, he gently kneaded this area where women tend to accumulate fat.

Li Weijie’s right hand, like the Red Army during the Long March, completely withdrew from its fixed position under her and began to move slowly on her waist. Women generally dislike being tickled, so a few touches made Xia Weiwei squirm uncontrollably. Her attention was drawn by the kisses above and the tickling below, and before her left hand could come to her rescue, she was unexpectedly "Northward" dodging the intercepting "reinforcements." When they almost suffocated from lack of breath due to kissing, he reached the "Mountain" above and set up camp there.

After what seemed like an eternity, their lips finally separated from the long kiss, both breathing heavily. But they looked into each other’s eyes, as if trying to read the other’s heart or convey everything through their gaze.

In any case, neither wanted to leave this intimate embrace. Xia Weiwei’s thoughts and rationality returned after the kiss ended.

She immediately felt Li Weijie’s excited and passionate expression, his hot breath, and the firm yet gentle movements. Especially from her lower abdomen and thighs, she felt his hard male feature, making her realize what this intimate game would lead to.

Xia Weiwei did not withdraw the hands embracing his shoulders but closed her clear eyes, slightly turning her head. Her pearly white teeth gently bit her lips as she lay flat on the bed, trembling and softening in the elastic sofa cushion.

In fact, Xia Weiwei had liked Li Weijie for a long time. Since she rescued him from those ruffians and got injured protecting him, entering the hospital, she had silently liked this junior brother. Only because Li Weijie had a girlfriend did she keep her love hidden in her heart, not letting him know.

Now that Lin Yixun had left him, Xia Weiwei decided to pursue her own happiness. This led to her actively entering Li Weijie’s life, silently comforting and helping him when he needed support and encouragement, and eventually falling in love with each other.

Li Weijie had considerable experience dealing with such matters. Seeing that Xia Weiwei did not stop his actions and even closed her eyes, he clearly saw it as encouragement to continue.

In such a situation, any man would want to take this love game to the end. Li Weijie was no exception.

Li Weijie leaned down again, pecking Xia Weiwei’s cherry lips. His left hand continued to knead her buttocks, while his right hand began to move over the enticing double peaks, sometimes gently and sometimes heavily, squeezing and caressing. When his hand slid to the outer side of her left peak, he used his palm in an arc shape to support the trembling and protruding breast.

These simple teasing methods had already aroused Xia Weiwei’s entire spirit. With Li Weijie’s hand movements, she kept twisting her body, making her breasts tremble in his hands like jelly. Her soft abdomen and round thighs uncooperatively rubbed against the most sensitive part of him, provoking his rational limits.

Finally, Li Weijie could no longer bear it. Although they both felt each other’s love, although she had not said she would marry only him, and although he had once secretly vowed not to infringe on her purity, in this situation, with Xia Weiwei’s tacit approval, his rationality was thrown to the back of his mind. His brain was filled with desire, and he had only one thought: to release himself, to possess the woman beneath him.

Li Weijie’s left hand slowly moved upward. In Xia Weiwei’s dazed state, he untied the shoulder straps of her thin nightgown. With his hands apart, the nightgown slid to her waist, leaving only a white bra on her upper body.

His mouth kissed down from Xia Weiwei’s cherry lips, past her chin and neck to the valley between her double peaks. The bra cups could barely cover these areas, so Li Weijie would occasionally push his tongue into the edges of the bra to touch deeper areas.

Li Weijie held each breast in his hands, and his head was like being sandwiched between two peaks, buried deep in the valley.

After several minutes, Li Weijie stopped his licking and took a deep breath of the strong scent of milk mixed with her body odor. He raised his head slightly and looked at this pair of "monstrous" peaks.

His hands followed the edge of the bra, feeling around Xia Weiwei’s back. After a moment of exploration, he skillfully opened the bra clasp with his hands and pulled out the straps from under her body, flipping them up. The bra was now hanging above its protectors—the trembling breasts—becoming a decoration, losing its function of covering and restraining. The snow-white peaks were now exposed to the invader’s claws, trembling unnaturally.

Seeing the two pink spots on the snow-white peaks, Li Weijie pounced again. This time his mouth did not linger in the valley but leaped to the peaks, sucking and licking. His hands simultaneously used the "milk-grabbing dragon claw" technique that had once made Lin Yixun feel like she was in heaven, feeling the good elasticity of the breasts as he squeezed and released them.

Li Weijie’s tongue and fingers brought her unprecedented pleasure, making her involuntarily lift and sway her chest as if to drown the "bad guy" in a wave of undulating peaks. If he could really be buried there, all men would envy Li Weijie for dying in such a place.

While playing with Xia Weiwei’s breasts, Li Weijie was not content to stay there. He began to explore new territories more actively.

Men are always interested and talented in exploring women’s bodies, hehe!

Li Weijie remembered reading a report about a married couple who had been together for three years and went to the hospital to check their bodies, wondering why they hadn’t had a child. The doctor’s examination revealed that the woman was still a virgin. It turned out that after they got married, they would just sleep together in bed every day, and their sexual life was limited to kissing. Li Weijie just wanted to say how可怜那新娘子……

Li Weijie slightly moved his body, no longer lying completely on Xia Weiwei. His upper body remained in the same position while his lower body moved to one side of her body, only pressing on her right leg. His mouth occupied the left peak while his left hand still held the right one, and his right hand secretly moved down to Xia Weiwei’s left buttocks. He increased the intensity and expanded the range of his massage.

He rubbed, squeezed, and pinched her plump and uplifted buttocks. He pressed his fingers into the crack between her buttocks, sliding back and forth. Although there were two layers of fabric from the nightgown and underwear, each time his fingertips touched her sensitive areas, it would cause a slight tremor in her body, making Li Weijie very interested in this interaction.

However, when Li Weijie thought he had not reached the main point yet, he stopped teasing her sensitive areas and moved his hand to Xia Weiwei’s thighs.

He rubbed up and down on the smooth skin of her legs. Regular exercise and maintenance had made her thighs full but not fat, strong yet supple.

His goal was not just the thighs. No, it wasn’t just the thighs. Although Xia Weiwei’s thighs were full and long, round and white, Li Weijie’s hand gradually moved to the inner side of her thighs, inch by inch reaching the root. He used the edge of his palm to "accidentally" touch and rub her mysterious area between her thighs, causing spasms in her legs.

After this preliminary preparation, Li Weijie’s palm firmly and accurately occupied the key points.

“Ah…”

With Xia Weiwei’s repressed cry, her body involuntarily stiffened and she tried to close her legs to protect herself.

But she did not realize that the "bad guy" lying on top of her had anticipated this. While teasing her lower limbs with his legs and feet, he slipped his right leg between hers when she was slightly distracted, firmly controlling her right leg and separating her legs.

Now Xia Weiwei could not close her legs because of his leg in between, so she had to submit.

While maintaining the upper body attack, Li Weijie intensified his assault on her lower body.

Following various methods that had formed in his mind, his hand challenged the most delicate and hidden parts of a woman. His right hand moved like playing piano or drumming, lightly, heavily, slowly, and quickly on the sacred area between her legs. In no time, Xia Weiwei’s body had a strong reaction.

Under the stimulation of his right hand, Xia Weiwei’s buttocks reflexively tried to lift up and pull back, trying to avoid the invading hand. But with his body pressing her down on the bed, her buttocks did not lift up and her lower body could not pull back. Instead, her waist arched upward, making her chest push up against his face.

---

**Chapter 011: Virgin**

Due to the clever constraint of his body, Xia Weiwei’s movements were intense but only small. This not only stimulated his senses more but also had no other effect.

After her first "ah" sound, Xia Weiwei closed her mouth and suppressed the urge to shout, but the unprecedented stimulation made it impossible for her not to make a sound.

Firstly, "hm… hm… hmmmm… hm…"

Low muffled sounds, then her tightly closed mouth could not help but open, and the sound changed from "hm" to "ah," then gradually rose in pitch.

Fortunately, they were inside the house. The room had good sound insulation and was spacious enough that most neighbors who hadn’t returned from nightlife were already asleep. Otherwise, this passionate "performance" would have caused quite a stir.

Of course, they were so engrossed that neither noticed this. The next day when they woke up and recalled it, they realized the awkwardness of the "concert."

Although they were embarrassed about this later on, since both hoped for things to happen naturally and did not overly suppress their emotions, it became a private joke between them. In future intimate moments, the "concert" continued and even had new variations. This was for later.

As Xia Weiwei’s screams became more urgent, her breathing heavier, and her temperature rising, Li Weijie withdrew his hand from the battlefield. This was a "play hard to get" tactic.

He moved his right hand up and touched Xia Weiwei’s small, round navel, drawing circles around it.

With the top of her shirt short enough to expose her navel and pants with a high waistline, this was a test for modern women’s figures. Having an attractive navel has become a focus of attention, and every woman hopes that the exposed parts are beautiful and sexy. Besides natural beauty, post-care is especially important. To make her abdomen look smooth and bright, using foundation to decorate it is a good method. On ordinary days, we can use powder that matches the color of her abdomen to directly apply it. For important occasions, we can use foundation cream that matches the color of her abdomen and use a wet sponge to apply it, covering all exposed areas.

It was unknown whether today was an important day for Xia Weiwei, but Li Weijie could be sure that her abdomen and navel were not decorated at all, completely natural.

Due to Hong Kong entertainment star Duangmu Guanxi’s inability to repair a laptop, everyone knew about the once轰动一时的“艳照门”事件. Li Weijie also paid attention and was impressed by Zhang Ziyi’s belly ring.

Xia Weiwei, almost suffocating from his teasing and her consciousness about to fly away, was suddenly interrupted by Li Weijie’s actions, feeling as if she were hanging in mid-air.

She subconsciously moved her lower body, searching for that magic hand to regain the stimulating yet comfortable feeling, allowing him to feel her lower abdomen’s softness.

Seeing that the time was right, Li Weijie stretched out his palm and moved it like a knife from her navel downward. Through the loose defense of the nightgown hanging around her waist, he arrived at his long-desired "paradise." Feeling the misty and flowing hot spring in this paradise, Li Weijie’s hand began its busy work. The direct skin contact was different from the previous "indirect touch," feeling better but also more stimulating.

Xia Weiwei’s brows were tightly furrowed, her mouth open in a shape as if she was about to say "ah," but for some reason, her airway seemed blocked, and no sound came out. She only occasionally moved her lips.

Her hands firmly held the man’s head, pressing it tightly against her full breasts; her back arched upward, lifting off the bed. Her free left leg involuntarily lifted up, her knee bent toward her chest and paused beside her body.

Her tender white toes curled and stretched, very alluring but also revealing the tension and stimulation she felt.

After a while, with Xia Weiwei’s long, forceful cry, "Ah, ah…"

Her body that was arched and taut collapsed, her legs weakly returned to their original position. Her facial twitching stopped, and she regained calmness. Sweat glistened on her nose and forehead, the blush spreading from her face to her chest.

At this moment, Xia Weiwei appeared weak and somewhat dazed, but Li Weijie knew how excited she had been and the strength she possessed.

At this moment, Li Weijie’s hand that was still in Xia Weiwei’s legs could still feel the lingering aftereffects of her climax. Her thighs occasionally spasmed, and for the first time in twenty-five years, she experienced her maidenhood’s bloom. The petals opened and closed rhythmically, and a wet, slippery fluid slowly flowed from the valley between her legs… even at first, there were occasional fine streams spurting out…

Before actually making love, Xia Weiwei reached her first sexual climax in a man’s mysterious "hand techniques."

Although Li Weijie was not the first time to touch women’s most mysterious and enticing禁区, he knew from physiological books and experience that the woman beneath him had reached her first climax.

Li Weijie withdrew his right hand from Xia Weiwei’s lower abdomen, holding it in front of him. His palm was covered with a semi-transparent, milky white secretion from her body, and there were several bright threads between his fingers. There were also a few curly black hairs.

He brought the hand to his nose and sniffed, feeling an indescribable scent that filled his brain. This unique feminine odor made him feel very fond, very satisfying, and very stimulating.

He licked the liquid on his hand, tasting it. It was quite good, clean and clear with a faint sweetness.

Previously, Li Weijie had been a devoted man with only one girlfriend, Lin Yixun. He did not know what other women’s secretions tasted like, but Xia Weiwei’s and Lin Yixun’s were the same.

Good things should be shared. Li Weijie wanted to tease Xia Weiwei again, so he turned his palm over and brought it under her nose.

Although Xia Weiwei had kept her eyes closed, she knew his every move through the sensations in her body.

Although the liquid on his hand was hers, thinking of its source made her blush and turn away.

Seeing Xia Weiwei’s actions, Li Weijie raised the corner of his mouth and smiled silently. "It's time to get serious!"

He said to himself.

Li Weijie lightly rubbed his hand on Xia Weiwei’s bare chest, spreading the secretion all over her body. Then he sat up and quickly stripped off his clothes. With Xia Weiwei’s cooperation, they removed the few remaining pieces of her clothing, and finally stood naked before each other.

Xia Weiwei’s tender skin shimmered like a gem under the soft light. Li Weijie’s trembling fingers gently caressed her nose, neck, collarbone, the high and blushing chest, the flat abdomen without a single ounce of fat, her legs, and even her toes. Then he gently parted her legs and softly said, "Weiwei, I’m going to enter."

Xia Weiwei blushed shyly and gave a soft "mm" sound, as if giving him permission. He raised his already hard member and slowly entered her.

“Ah! It hurts…”

Xia Weiwei reached out to stop Li Weijie’s entry but accidentally grabbed his hot member, blushing and quickly letting go.

“Don’t be afraid, it will feel better soon.”

Li Weijie pushed and finally entered her.

Xia Weiwei bit her lips tightly, tears rolling down like pearls. Li Weijie quickly leaned in to kiss away the tears…

What happened next was a natural progression.

When crossing that mysterious line for the first time, she was so fragile in her nakedness, while his feeling was one of fulfillment.

**What do women find most attractive to men? Men love women’s loveliness, beauty, the excitement of receiving a first love letter, the nervousness of going on a first date with a boy, the shyness of holding hands for the first time, the tenderness of leaning on a man’s shoulder for the first time, the nervousness of kissing for the first time, the half-hearted resistance during the first intimate touch, the anticipation and anxiety of becoming a bride for the first time, the affectionate gaze when lying together for the first time, and the romantic sentiment of living with a beloved person.

Men love women’s subtlety, their gentle and flowing nature, and their shyness. These countless firsts that make women worth loving are only given by virgins.

Men love the membrane, but even more so they love all the countless firsts hidden beneath it. They love the myriad of beautiful expressions women can show.

When entering Xia Weiwei’s body, Li Weijie knew she was still a virgin. A beautiful woman of twenty-five years old had so many temptations, and she managed to preserve her purity for twenty-five years. This was truly admirable.

Xia Weiwei’s final defense was breached, and they made love. It intoxicated her heart and soul.

“Weiwei, you are now mine. I will cherish you…”

Li Weijie said as he caressed her beautiful breasts, kissing her forehead, cheeks, lips, neck, and behind the ears—her most sensitive spots. He used his fingers to gently massage her Renzhong and Renshen acupoints, provoking Xia Weiwei’s desire to forget the pain of her first night.
