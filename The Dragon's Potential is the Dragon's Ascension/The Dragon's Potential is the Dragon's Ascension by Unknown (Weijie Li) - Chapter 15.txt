Li Najiāo’s rosy and delicate face, flushed with two patches of red, revealed a hint of embarrassment as she said, “No, it was Director Shen who asked me to tell you that this time I will be going with you to Taiwan, serving as your assistant.”

The little girl’s expression was bashful and her rosy cheeks were truly dazzling, irresistibly charming.

Chapter 29: Xiao Jie, Peeping

What did a regular white-collar worker need an assistant for? To find someone to watch over him? Afraid he would abscond with the money? Li Weijie’s mind was filled with lewd fantasies, but his eyes revealed a more teasing expression. He chuckled and said, “You could have just called me; there was no need to come in person. Yes, but since you’re here, let’s go for dinner together!”

His handsome face and gentle smile were captivating. Li Najiāo’s rosy cheeks blushed again, she glanced at Li Weijie with a mixture of shyness and joy, her face flushed with embarrassment as she said, “I’m telling you something serious. Can’t you speak more seriously?”

After saying this, she stepped back a few paces as if afraid Li Weijie would do something to her. Li Weijie was about to say more, but the beauty had already left without giving him a chance. She darted away like a yellowbird.

Watching Li Najiāo’s graceful departure, Li Weijie whistled lightly. He didn’t know that at the same time, Shen Mònóng was feeling frustrated. She had decided to go with Li Weijie so she could tease him, but the company suddenly had a million-dollar deal to discuss. As director, he couldn’t leave.

After much thought, Shen Mònóng decided to send someone else with Li Weijie. Initially, she thought of sending a man, but feared that Li Weijie might be led astray by another man. So she chose a girl, and finally selected Li Najiāo from the secretarial department.

***

Only, Shen Mònóng had not considered that sending a beautiful girl with Li Weijie on a business trip was like putting the lamb in front of the wolf.

After Li Najiāo left, Li Weijie composed himself and reopened his computer to search extensively on Baidu. After half an hour, he gradually gained a basic understanding of the lingerie industry.

In the lingerie market, women’s underwear accounted for 80% of sales. The design requirements were simpler compared to ready-to-wear clothing, but the trendiness was astonishingly fast. To succeed in this field, one had to constantly introduce new designs.

Currently, the Dianfen Group held a dominant position in lingerie design and production. Its brand was well-known internationally, but there were few companies specializing solely in women’s lingerie.

Other major producers like Beijierong, Sanqiang, and AB also included both men’s and women’s designs. Thus, Tianfeng Group’s strategy was somewhat risky, but if they could quickly establish a foothold, the prospects would be bright.

Practically speaking, Li Weijie decided to visit various lingerie stores for firsthand observation.

Looking at the countless colorful and tiny undergarments on his computer screen, along with enticing descriptions, Li Weijie felt a certain part of him swelling. He had added water to his teacup three times, and now that he was relaxed, it needed release.

Hearing that holding urine could lead to uremia, Li Weijie rushed to the toilet.

Although his mind was filled with images of bras and panties, he still felt relieved as he emptied the accumulated water from his body. Just as he was enjoying the afterglow, he heard a sound from next door.

The sound was pleasant and rhythmic. Li Weijie, even if he had never seen a pig walk, knew what it was. The men’s restroom was adjacent to the women’s, separated by a thin wall.

Listening to the water hitting the toilet bowl, Li Weijie’s soft organ swelled suddenly.

It was a woman urinating; men’s urination sounded like a flood, “whoosh,” while women’s was more delicate, like water spurting from a small opening in a dam.

Since morning and afternoon, when the siren of desire was aroused by Huang Ying’s teasing, and after an hour of reading about lingerie, Li Weijie was stimulated by the sound of a woman urinating and became aroused.

“Damn, even the sound of women peeing is so seductive…”

Listening to the woman’s urination from next door, Li Weijie felt a burning desire. He raised his head to listen more closely.

Huh! There was a gap there. Due to recent natural disasters and frequent earthquakes, a one-inch crack had appeared between the men’s and women’s restrooms.

Li Weijie was the first to notice this gap. If not for his sharp eyes, he wouldn’t have discovered it. Other perverts might have known about this “leak” earlier, and the company’s beautiful women could have been exposed.

While thinking, Li Weijie climbed onto the toilet seat quietly and softly. With his body’s flexibility, yoga or gymnastics would be easy for him.

Climbing onto the toilet seat, Li Weijie quickly opened his eyes and peered through the gap. His heart raced as he looked towards the women’s restroom.

Men are indeed a bit vulgar; other women’s lower bodies were all similar. Although there was talk of the twelve most desirable parts, it had no scientific basis. His wife or girlfriend’s lower body was similar to other women’s in color, shape, and hairiness.

Those with wives, girlfriends, mistresses, or lovers saw them daily but still liked to peek at others’, especially when caught by surprise. Wasn’t that vulgar?

Although Li Weijie was tall and stood at 180 cm, he had to stand on tiptoe with his neck stretched like a giraffe to see through the gap. Suddenly, Li Weijie’s bright eyes bulged.

Beautiful white and delicate thighs, all words to describe beautiful legs could be used here. Two round and plump buttocks spanned the entire toilet seat, with half of them exposed.

The pubic hair was neatly trimmed. Unfortunately, the woman was squatting and he couldn’t see her private parts. Li Weijie sighed; without x-ray vision, even if his eyes bulged, he couldn’t see.

However, women were different. This woman’s legs were so long and beautiful; her buttocks were so white, soft, and round.

Because she was sitting, a dip could be seen between her waist and buttocks, indicating that her waist was slender. Her curves were very alluring.

“Hurry up and stand, hurry up…”

Li Weijie prayed fervently. His heart was like seven monkeys scratching itchy spots, anxious and eager to see her stand so he could glimpse more.

“Who is this beautiful lady from the company? Her figure is so stunning.”

Like most men, Li Weijie looked at women’s chests, buttocks, and legs first. He had been staring at her buttocks and lower body so much that he forgot to look at her face.

His gaze lingered on the woman’s face. Was it her? Recognizing the woman, Li Weijie felt his heart warm and his body soften. His lower organ became more prominent; it was Secretary Boss Liu Ruyan.

Her hair, often treated with ionic care, flowed like clouds. Her face was as smooth as jade, her eyebrows delicate, eyes clear, nose straight and prominent, lips rosy. From any angle, she was a top beauty. Her figure was graceful and slender.

When it came to Liu Ruyan, no one in the company didn’t know her. Her face was so perfect that men couldn’t look at it for long; her breasts were so prominent, her buttocks so round, and her legs so long. If she was pinched, it would be fatal! Especially those red lips, like fire burning, filled men with a desire to kiss her.

Although she didn’t have as many admirers as in novels, where men lined up from the company entrance to the parking lot, or had a salary of less than 20,000 yuan per month and no car, she still attracted attention.

Once a department manager came to her every day with flowers and picked her up in a Toyota, only to see several luxury cars parked there for Christmas. He left embarrassedly, and the security guards laughed at him.

Li Weijie knew his own limits with such a top beauty. He could fantasize all he wanted, but shouldn’t show it; otherwise, he might be fired. Many high-ranking officials in the company were pursuing Liu Ruyan.

Suppressing his breath, Li Weijie listened to her elegant urination sound. Soon it stopped, followed by the rustling of toilet paper.

After a moment, Liu Ruyan stood up. Her movements were swift; she held her panties as she rose. Li Weijie glimpsed between her legs briefly, only remembering the pink color.

After putting on her panties, she moved slowly and gently. The pink panties were visible, as well as the upper part of her thighs that he usually couldn’t see.

A pink bra strap was visible under her white silk blouse, and the elastic of her flesh-colored stockings could be seen on her legs. She pulled up her pleated skirt and fastened the belt.

Each of Liu Ruyan’s movements was graceful, exuding a captivating allure that made Li Weijie desire her intensely.

Ah, finished. Li Weijie gathered his thoughts and got off the toilet seat to wash his hands when a moan came from the gap, accompanied by heavy breathing…

Chapter 30: Lace

Based on his extensive experience with Japanese AV films and over a hundred real-life encounters, Li Weijie knew this was the sound of a woman’s breath during arousal.

Could Liu Ruyan be aroused after urination? He couldn’t believe it. This proud and cold beauty…

The more he thought, the more his heart itched. Li Weijie quickly returned to his position and peered through the gap. A cold breeze blew, and her moan echoed.

Li Weijie, who considered himself imaginative, even dreamed of writing a book titled "Guess Who I Am" about his encounters with countless beauties. But he never imagined seeing such a scene.

Liu Ruyan was an exquisite beauty, and now she was incredibly sexy. Her blouse was completely unbuttoned, revealing a pink lingerie set that dazzled and enticed. The straps of her bra hung off her smooth, jade-like arm, leaving her large breasts exposed and swaying.

As she moved, her plump buttocks trembled. Her flesh-colored stockings reflected a faint glow, mysterious and elegant. This usually cold and proud beauty was now leaning over another person’s legs…

Li Weijie wasn’t jealous; he was stunned. Yes, he was completely stunned.

He saw Liu Ruyan extend her moist tongue to lightly lick the other person’s inner thigh, who gasped in satisfaction. Her long hair cascaded over her glowing skin. In that moment, Li Weijle saw the petite and charming woman was…

<><><><><><><><><><><><> Leaving the Yulong Building, he looked at the sky. It was bright; in summer, it wouldn’t get dark until around 8 PM.

Impossible! How could this be? She didn’t look like it. Could she really be a lesbian?

Alas! What a beautiful girl, to be a lesbian!

A thin horse is slow because it’s weak; a man isn’t romantic because he’s poor.

Li Weijie increasingly realized the truth of this saying since Lin Yixun left him. He knew his willpower wasn’t strong, and now with continuous temptations, he was losing control.

This might be an opportunity to get close to the cold and elegant Liu Ruyan. Li Weijie’s thoughts became active.

Walking on a busy street, he entered a KFC. After 5 PM, it was dinner time; the restaurant was crowded.

Li Weijie waited in line for a while, bought some fries and a hamburger with a Coke. He sat in a corner, not liking to be watched like an animal from outside.

While eating fries, he thought about which department store to visit for a lingerie market survey. Of course, this would depend on the appearance and figure of the salesgirls.

Recalling which department store had beautiful salesgirls, Li Weijie finished his food, leaving half a Coke.

As he prepared to leave, a clear female voice behind him said, “Sir, would you mind helping with our survey?”

Li Weijie turned to see a beautiful girl standing behind him, about 22 or 23 years old. She was not tall, around 160 cm, and could be described as petite.

Her shoulder-length hair was wavy, her eyebrows like distant mountains. Her large eyes were clear and bright, like two pools of water. She had a small nose and cherry lips; her oval face was smooth as jade, delicate skin that could be pinched. Her slender figure and prominent chest made her a beautiful young woman.

She held a stack of papers and two paper bags, both from Dreambasha.

Li Weijie liked her appearance; she looked at him hopefully, while his eyes fell on the two paper bags. Dreambasha was a lingerie brand; he knew this from his recent research.

She noticed his gaze and blushed, quickly placing the bags on the table. She sat beside him and smiled, “A survey about college students; it won’t take long, and there’s a gift…”

Gift! She only had the survey papers; could it be in those bags? He wondered, his eyes examining her. She wore a white blouse that was slightly puffed out; she had on a gray skirt, just above the knee. Her slender legs were captivating.

“Wh-What gift?” Li Weijie asked, his breath slightly quickened.

“It’s this…” She took a Dreambasha bag and rummaged through it.

As she moved, Li Weijie’s eyes followed naturally. He had a keen eye for beauty; he saw a red full-cup bra with half-transparent lace straps peeking out. The deep cups indicated her breasts were ample.

Unexpectedly, this beautiful girl had such large breasts; Li Weijie glanced again at her chest under the blouse, which looked like two tents.

He swallowed and his gaze fell below her waist. Her skirt couldn’t hide the stunning curve of her buttocks.

Men had different preferences for breasts, some liking larger ones and others smaller. But buttocks were universally admired: firm, round, and elastic. Combined with soft skin, they ignited passion.

“Sorry, not this one…”

She blushed and put the Dreambasha bag aside. She took out a keychain from another bag, showing her cute little teeth and said, “Hello Kitty keychain. How is it? Pretty?”

Li Weijie stared at the Hello Kitty, wondering why she chose such a gift for him. He smiled and said, “Survey about… college cohabitation? Premarital sex? Doesn’t matter. Let’s start. What’s your name?”

“Song Yannü…”

Song Yannü blushed at Li Weijie’s words, unsure how to respond. She finally said her name.

After she finished, Song Yannü looked at Li Weijie in surprise. He smiled inwardly, pleased to know her name so easily.

Song Yannü took out a pen and asked, “Alright, first question: Have you ever shopped online? A. Yes, B. No, C. Occasionally…”

As Li Weijie answered, she marked the answers with her pen. Her hair fell over her forehead.

Li Weijie had a chance to admire Song Yannü. Her forehead was slightly wider, her eyes large and watery, nose delicate and straight, lips in a sexy heart shape. Her teeth were white and even.

Song Yannü was a beautiful woman who made him imagine, Li Weijie thought. If he surveyed someone at night, they might drag him to the grass and kiss him.

The survey lasted three minutes. Most of Li Weijie’s answers were “No,” “Occasionally,” or “Don’t know.”

Song Yannü frowned slightly. According to Li Weijie’s answers, this survey was almost useless.

Was he playing with her? She looked at Li Weijie. His hair was neat, eyebrows sharp, nose straight, lips thin and curved. He looked clean and fit.

Song Yannü felt a flutter in her heart, Li Weijie shrugged and asked, “Done?”

“Yeah, thank you for your participation.”

Song Yannü handed him the Hello Kitty keychain. As her hand extended halfway, tragedy struck.

Her Coke spilled; Li Weijie was shocked. Song Yannü hurried to clean up, but her arm knocked the Dreambasha bag into Li Weijie’s lap.

“Splat,” the lingerie and panties spilled out, colorful. Song Yannü blushed furiously, reaching to grab them.

Li Weijie’s body stiffened as he felt something hard and soft being grabbed…

Song Yannü, trying to retrieve her intimate items, accidentally touched something soft and hard. It suddenly swelled…

Chapter 31: Mother-Daughter Duo

Song Yannü’s slender waist bent slightly, her upper body leaning forward. Her blouse opened to reveal a pink chest and deep cleavage. Her white skin blushed, her buttocks slightly lifted, stunning Li Weijie.

Due to the position, he could see her white panties and a one-piece pantyhose. Song Yannü had an exquisite, plump buttocks.

Li Weijie kissed her soft lips passionately. This was clearly her first kiss, shy and passive.

Li Weijie wasn’t bold; he knew no one would discover them. Recently, news of two teenage boys molesting a 4-year-old girl in a fast-food restaurant had made him confident. With his keen senses, he could stop if someone approached.

He kissed her deeply and held her tightly. One hand was on her waist, the other grabbed her breast.

Her skirt cut off her round buttocks and white thighs. Under the light, a slight bulge was visible between her legs.

He felt full and soft as he squeezed her breast. She moaned softly, opening her mouth. His tongue entered, gently teasing hers.

His hand became more active, massaging and squeezing her sensitive spot.

Song Yannü couldn’t take it anymore; she went limp, panting heavily. Li Weijie kissed her face, and she let him do as he pleased.

He shifted slightly, startling the hand holding his organ. Song Yannü realized what she was holding and gasped, her body stiffened, eyes closed. Her chest rose rapidly, breasts trembling.

Li Weijie’s head heated up; he started unbuttoning her blouse. She woke up, arms crossed over her chest, glaring at him.

“What are you doing?”

Li Weijie smiled mischievously. “Miss Song, I want to see your lingerie…”

“No, no…”

She was firm.

“Don’t let me up if you don’t show me. Who will be embarrassed?”

Li Weijie was being stubborn.

“Here? Someone might see…”

Song Yannü hesitated, her posture unseemly.

“Don’t worry, no one will come…”

He bit her earlobe. “Let me see; I’ll let you up…”

She relaxed, and he unbuttoned her blouse. Inside was a white lace bra revealing half of her breasts.

Experienced, he quickly unhooked the bra. With a soft sound, he lifted it and looked at her breasts.

Her white, round, full breasts were slightly raised. He touched them gently, squeezing lightly.

Before she could protest, he kissed her breasts softly.

She shivered, blushing deeply. She hugged him tightly, pressing his face against her chest.

“I want to get my gift…”

Li Weijie mumbled, nearly suffocated by her breasts.

“What… what gift?”

Song Yannü’s head was dizzy, heart fluttering. She hoped someone would save her but feared being seen.

“It’s this…”

He pulled off the bra and put it in his pocket. He saw a beautiful woman and her daughter approaching.

He took a deep breath; he knew them well. Song Yannü was grateful to escape his grasp, fearing he would take her here.

She hurriedly buttoned her blouse and grabbed the scattered items. She picked up the survey papers, hugged her chest, and rushed to the bathroom.

She wasn’t bold enough to go out without underwear. She had new lingerie in her bag, so she went to change.

Li Weijie didn’t leave; he turned his back, facing the wall. He looked through the tiles, observing them.

“Mom, why hasn’t Brother Yanzi contacted me this summer? I’ll ignore him next time and demand money…”

“Yanzi, he’s graduated; maybe he’s busy looking for a job…”

Their voices grew closer. Li Weijie felt anxious; since his sophomore year, he had tutored a high school girl named Gu Yanzi. They had developed a close bond; she called him big brother, and her mother treated him like a sister.

Gu Yanzi was lively and smart. She lived with her mother, Gu Yumei. Perhaps due to a lack of fatherly love, she was stubborn and strong-willed. Many tutors left because of her.

But Li Weijie got along well with Gu Yanzi; she behaved well in front of him. Her mother wondered how he managed it.

Gu Yanzi said Li Weijie was handsome and resembled her father. Over two years, his influence made Gu Yanzi more gentle.

Gu Yanzi was a beautiful girl with long hair and an elegant face. Her developing body had once captivated Li Weijie.

Compared to Lin Yixin’s sweetness, Xia Weiwei’s elegance, Su Yuya’s gentleness, Shen Mònóng’s grace, and Liu Ruyan’s cold beauty, Gu Yumei had a mature allure. Her every inch of skin was captivating.

She looked 33 but was actually 39, fresh from a bath. She wore a white dress, her skin smooth and fragrant.

Her arms and legs were exposed; the V-neck revealed her breasts. Her high, rounded breasts moved gracefully.

Her mature charm was intoxicating; Li Weijie’s blood rushed to his head. Gu Yumei knew her beauty was alluring, making men proud and frustrated.

“Mom knows!”

Gu Yanzi pouted. “I didn’t call him because I don’t want to distract him.”

“Giggle…”

Gu Yumei stroked her daughter’s hair, smiling. “Yanzi is growing up and knows how to care for others.”

Their voices faded; Li Weijie sighed. They had seen Song Yannü stuffing her things into the bag, so he hoped they didn’t see his face.

Chapter 32: Lingerie Store

Li Weijie wandered aimlessly on the streets, eventually reaching the Trade Center where Shen Mònóng had bought his outfit.

Entering the building and finding the lingerie store, Li Weijie hesitated outside. A man alone in a women’s lingerie store was awkward.

He took deep breaths, entered the store. The two young salesgirls noticed him.

This wasn’t because they were infatuated; the store had never seen a single male customer before. It was an international women’s lingerie brand, selling only women’s undergarments.

Though men saw models in lingerie on TV or at car shows, they were different alone in a women’s lingerie store.

When Li Weijie entered calmly, one girl whispered to the other, “Do we have men’s products now?”

The other shook her head. “I don’t remember.”

“Then him…”

She pointed at Li Weijie, the other shook her head.

Li Weijie’s face turned red from the moment he entered. His temperature was so high that an egg could fry on his face.

Now, Li Weijie was the center of attention. Everyone looked at him curiously.

They wondered how a man dared to come alone, as their boyfriends or husbands were dragged in.
