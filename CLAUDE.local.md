- Always convert the xtests in normal tests. negative tests are confusing. Just make the test explicitly check for the negative outcome instead, and if the outcome is negative, the test is passed. Always show me a nicely color formatted table with the list of all tests (the functions, not the file) and the outcome (fail, success, skip, error). The table must use unicode border blocks to delimit the cells, thicker for the header row. Also the table should report not only the name of the function, but the description of the test function in the docstrings. All tests functions should include a meaningful one line string that syntetically describes the test and its aim. If a test function lacks this description, add it to the source files of the tests. All tests functions must have docstrings with a short description that will be used by the table to describe the test. You should always do this when reporting the tests results. Also mark the slow tests (those slow tests that are usually skipped when running the tests on github, or that need some extra big dependencies installed that they install themselves) with the emoji of a snail.
